pub.1077130253,,Disseminating relevant health information to underserved audiences: implications of the Digital Divide Pilot Projects.,"OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the influence of the digital divide on disparities in health outcomes for vulnerable populations, identifying implications for medical and public libraries. METHOD: The paper describes the results of the Digital Divide Pilot Projects demonstration research programs funded by the National Cancer Institute to test new strategies for disseminating relevant health information to underserved and at-risk audiences. RESULTS: The Digital Divide Pilot Projects field-tested innovative systemic strategies for helping underserved populations access and utilize relevant health information to make informed health-related decisions about seeking appropriate health care and support, resisting avoidable and significant health risks, and promoting their own health. IMPLICATIONS: The paper builds on the Digital Divide Pilot Projects by identifying implications for developing health communication strategies that libraries can adopt to provide digital health information to vulnerable populations.",Journal of the Medical Library Association,2005,93,4 Suppl,s68-73,"Kreps, Gary L",George Mason University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1077130253,58,"[Chang, Betty L.; Bakken, Suzanne; Brown, S.

pub.1074719885,,"Library outreach: addressing Utah's ""Digital Divide"".","A ""Digital Divide"" in information and technological literacy exists in Utah between small hospitals and clinics in rural areas and the larger health care institutions in the major urban area of the state. The goals of the outreach program of the Spencer S. Eccles Health Sciences Library at the University of Utah address solutions to this disparity in partnership with the National Network of Libraries of Medicine-- Midcontinental Region, the Utah Department of Health, and the Utah Area Health Education Centers. In a circuit-rider approach, an outreach librarian offers classes and demonstrations throughout the state that teach information-access skills to health professionals. Provision of traditional library services to unaffiliated health professionals is integrated into the library's daily workload as a component of the outreach program.

pub.1078044770,,[Promoting nursing competitiveness: introduction to the digital divide].,"Increasingly sophisticated information technology (IT) has widened the gap (the so-called ""digital divide"") between those with effective access to IT resources and those without. Problems related to the digital divide exist in every country. In addition to level of familiarity with technology, the divide can also be influenced by factors of race, gender, age, education, economic status and area of residence. The digital divide may be ameliorated through technology innovations in terms of access to information, information application and information literacy. As IT is an increasingly significant component of modern healthcare, it may be expected that the ""width"" of the potential gap widens as IT applications increase in sophistication. Nursing professionals must keep abreast of advancing technologies in order to narrow the digital divide. To cope with this challenge, nursing professionals should enhance their understanding of new technologies beyond what is taught in formal education curricula. This knowledge enhancement may be attained through self learning or on-the-job training in nursing informatics. Content could cover hospital information system (IS) usage, security, applications and web access. This will improve the ability of nursing staff to face the current IT challenge.",Journal of Nursing,2010,57,1,95-9,"Lin, Chun-Hsu; Lee, Ting-Ting",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1078044770,2,

Existing literature on Internet uses by adults indicates that low income, less educated, and minority individuals are less likely to be online health seekers. Based on the analysis of data from the Pew Internet and American Life Project for the US, this study finds that teens of low education parents are either as likely as or even more likely than teens of high education parents to seek online health information.

pub.1077613065,,Network design for telemedicine--e-health using satellite technology.,"Over the last decade various international Information and Communications Technology networks have been created for a global access to high-level medical care. OP 2000 has designed and validated the high-end interactive video communication system WinVicos especially for telemedical applications, training of the physician in a distributed environment, teleconsultation and second opinion. WinVicos is operated on a workstation (WoTeSa) using standard hardware components and offers a superior image quality at a moderate transmission bandwidth of up to 2 Mbps. WoTeSa / WinVicos have been applied for IP-based communication in different satellite-based telemedical networks. In the DELTASS-project a disaster scenario was analysed and an appropriate telecommunication system for effective rescue measures for the victims was set up and evaluated. In the MEDASHIP project an integrated system for telemedical services (teleconsultation, teleelectro-cardiography, telesonography) on board of cruise ships and ferries has been set up. EMISPHER offers an equal access for most of the countries of the Euro-Mediterranean area to on-line services for health care in the required quality of service. E-learning applications, real-time telemedicine and shared management of medical assistance have been realized. The innovative developments in ICT with the aim of realizing a ubiquitous access to medical resources for everyone at any time and anywhere (u-Health) bear the risk of creating and amplifying a digital divide in the world. Therefore we have analyzed how the objective needs of the heterogeneous partners can be joined with the result that there is a need for real integration of the various platforms and services. A virtual combination of applications serves as the basic idea for the Virtual Hospital. The development of virtual hospitals and digital medicine helps to bridge the digital divide between different regions of the world and enables equal access to high-level medical care. Pre-operative planning, intra-operative navigation and minimally-invasive surgery require a digital and virtual environment supporting the perception of the physician.

This widening of disparities in American culture is likely to worsen over the coming years due, in part, to our increasing reliance on Internet-based technologies to disseminate health information and services. The purpose of the current article is to incorporate health literacy into an Integrative Model of eHealth Use. We argue for this theoretical understanding of eHealth literacy and propose that macro-level disparities in social structures are connected to health disparities through the micro-level conduits of eHealth literacy, motivation, and ability. In other words, structural inequities reinforce themselves and continue to contribute to healthcare disparities through the differential distribution of technologies that simultaneously enhance and impede literacy, motivation, and ability of different groups (and individuals) in the population. We conclude the article by suggesting pragmatic implications of our analysis.",Health Marketing Quarterly,2008,25,1-2,175-203,"Bodie, Graham D; Dutta, Mohan Jyoti",Louisiana State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040279089,195,"[Brashers, Dale E.;

pub.1059246934,10.1089/cpb.2006.9970,What Children Do on the Internet: Domains Visited and Their Relationship to Socio-Demographic Characteristics and Academic Performance,"HomeNetToo is a longitudinal field study designed to examine the antecedents and consequences of home Internet use in low-income families. Participants included 140 children, mostly 13-year-old African American (83%) boys (58%), living in single-parent households (75%) where the median annual income was $15,000 (USD). This report focuses on children's Internet activities, socio-demographic characteristics related to their Internet activities, and the relationship between academic performance and Internet activities. Overall, findings indicate that low-income children initially use the Internet primarily for entertainment. As home Internet use loses its novelty children become more focused in their Internet activities, reducing the number of websites they visit and visiting more websites targeted to their specific interests. Pornography websites are popular initially, especially among boys, but their popularity decreases dramatically after 3 months. Age, race, and sex have little influence on which websites are most popular. Academic performance predicts subsequent Internet activities, and Internet activities predict subsequent academic performance. Directions for future research to identify mechanisms that mediate the relationship between Internet activities and academic performance and implications for the digital divide are discussed.",Cyberpsychology Behavior and Social Networking,2007,10,2,182-190,"Jackson, Linda A.; Samona, Ricky; Moomaw, Jeff; Ramsay, Lauren; Murray, Christopher; Smith, Amy; Murray, Lindsay",Michigan State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1059246934,33,"[Rocheleau, Bruce]|[ur.014641540015.50]|Journal of Educational Computing Research|1995|12|1|1-17|10.2190/mhur-4fc9-b187-t8h4|pub.1003843218|68;[Blanton, William E.; Moorman, Gary B.; Hayes, Bobbie A.; Warner, Mark L.]|[ur.07677031305.23; ur.016402102505.59; ; ]|Journal of Educational Computing Research|1997|16|4|371-396|10.2190/0yaw-fyan-2t2b-0lp3|pub.1006029705|45;[Jackson, Linda A.; von Eye, Alexander; Barbatsis, Gretchen; Biocca, Frank; Zhao, Yong; Fitzgerald, Hiram E.]|[ur.01070755763.48; ur.01042557654.26; ur.01253317563.89; ur.014637772363.10; ur.01271544433.04; ur.0662366733.26]|International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|2003|59|3|355-382|10.1016/s1071-5819(03)00069-7|pub.1006879595|33;[Jackson, Linda A.; von Eye, Alexander; Biocca, Frank A.; Barbatsis, Gretchen; Zhao, Yong; Fitzgerald, Hiram E.]|[ur.01070755763.48; ur.01042557654.26; ur.014637772363.10; ur.01253317563.89; ur.01271544433.04; ur.0662366733.26]|Developmental Psychology|2006|42|3|429-435|10.1037/0012-1649.42.3.429|pub.1008890465|173;[Gross, Elisheva F.]|[ur.012303177773.77]|Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology|2004|25|6|633-649|10.1016/j.appdev.2004.09.005|pub.1008892976|511;[VALKENBURG, PATTI M.; SOETERS, KAREN E.]|[ur.0576733304.14; ur.015100504111.50]|Communication Research|2001|28|5|652-675|10.1177/009365001028005004|pub.1009965313|71;[Kraut, Robert; Scherlis, William; Mukhopadhyay, Tridas; Manning, Jane; Kiesler, Sara]|[ur.01065212052.21; ur.010534440251.33; ur.01263333020.18; ur.013513232455.43; ur.01345706760.32]|Communications of the ACM|1996|39|12|55-63|10.1145/240483.240493|pub.1010821654|160;[Jackson, Linda A.; Ervin, Kelly S.; Gardner, Philip D.; Schmitt, Neal]|[ur.01070755763.48; ur.011064071572.45; ur.016623651305.19; ur.015030215226.46]|Journal of Applied Social Psychology|2001|31|10|2019-2046|10.1111/j.1559-1816.2001.tb00162.x|pub.1018476267|52;[Jackson, Linda A.; Ervin, Kelly S.; Gardner, Philip D.; Schmitt, Neal]|[ur.01070755763.48; ur.011064071572.45; ur.016623651305.19; ur.015030215226.46]|Sex Roles|2001|44|5-6|363-379|10.1023/a:1010937901821|pub.1019455801|399;[Subrahmanyam, Kaveri; Greenfield, Patricia; Kraut, Robert; Gross, Elisheva]|[ur.01232162315.96; ur.01150276321.12; ur.01065212052.21; ur.012303177773.77]|Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology|2001|22|1|7-30|10.1016/s0193-3973(00)00063-0|pub.1019917353|326;[Facer, Keri; Furlong, Ruth]|[ur.01221066300.33; ur.010506710607.53]|Journal of Youth Studies|2001|4|4|451-469|10.1080/13676260120101905|pub.1036471466|105;[Jackson, Linda A.; von Eye, Alexander; Biocca, Frank A.; Barbatsis, Gretchen; Fitzgerald, Hiram E.; Zhao, Yong]|[ur.01070755763.48; ur.01042557654.26; ur.014637772363.10; ur.01253317563.89; ur.0662366733.26; ur.01271544433.04]|Swiss Journal of Psychology|2003|62|2|79-90|10.1024//1421-0185.62.2.79|pub.1056313272|35;[Hoffman, Donna L.; Novak, Thomas P.]|[ur.012265731146.27; ur.012777630633.16]|Science|1998|280|5362|390-391|10.1126/science.280.5362.390|pub.1062560768|271;[Subrahmanyam, K; Kraut, R E; Greenfield, P M; Gross, E F]|[ur.01232162315.96; ur.01065212052.21; ur.01150276321.12; ur.012303177773.77]|The Future of Children|2000|10|2|123-44|10.2307/1602692|pub.1069561094|271"
pub.1074760150,,The ten deadly mistakes of wanna-dots.,"Increasingly, it seems, there are just two types of companies left in the world: dot-coms, born on the Internet, and ""wanna-dots,"" established organizations that are seeking to incorporate the Internet into their businesses. Some wanna-dots manage the deep mind-shift required to cross the digital divide. These are the pacesetters--the first movers and fast followers that exhibit organizational curiosity and the desire to innovate. But most wanna-dots are laggards; they don't rise to the challenge with the same resolve. In a global research effort involving more than 800 companies, the author uncovered so many wanna-dots making the same kinds of mistakes that it almost seemed they were following a How Not to Change guide. In this article, Kanter creates just such a guide, offering ten pieces of antiadvice that expose the tendency of wanna-dots to make only cosmetic changes when deep transformation is required. Beyond delineating what not to do, Kanter serves up two examples of wanna-dots that got it right. First, Williams-Sonoma, which successfully made up for a slow start to create a strong Web presence. Second, Honeywell, a pacesetter led by e-believers from the start, which still found the road to the Web a challenging one. For companies not born digital, the fundamental problem is change. And the real place to look for change is not on the Internet but inside your company--at your own organizational culture and your attitude toward change.",Harvard Business Review,2001,79,1,"91-100, 175","Kanter, R M",Harvard University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1074760150,20,

The high-speed Internet provides an enormous real-time information exchange among physicians anywhere on earth. Computer-aided clinical decision support systems free up cancer experts in all stages of the cancer care continuum, including prevention, early detection, treatment and end-of-life care. Large registrations of cancer patients using the Internet enable us to construct large nationwide phenotypic and genotypic databases that allow clinicians to optimize individualized cancer treatment. Electronical medical records with an order-entry-system showing realtime clinical information provide safe, efficient and effective care. While new internet/intranet technologies reduce the inefficiencies of cancer care, the unintended consequences of the new informational technologies result in delivery of enormous unregulated clinical information, creating a digital divide between those using and not using the Internet, causing a decrease in communication.",Cancer & chemotherapy,2006,33,11,1571-4,"Usui, Kazuhiro; Ishihara, Teruo",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1077324963,0,
pub.1064003479,10.1177/1460458211414843,"Exploring digital divides: An examination of eHealth technology use in health information seeking, communication and personal health information management in the USA","Recent government initiatives to deploy health information technology in the USA, coupled with a growing body of scholarly evidence linking online heath information and positive health-related behaviors, indicate a widespread belief that access to health information and health information technologies can help reduce healthcare inequalities. However, it is less clear whether the benefits of greater access to online health information and health information technologies is equitably distributed across population groups, particularly to those who are underserved. To examine this issue, this article employs the 2007 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) to investigate relationships between a variety of socio-economic variables and the use of the web-based technologies for health information seeking, personal health information management and patient-provider communication within the context of the USA. This study reveals interesting patterns in technology adoption, some of which are in line with previous studies, while others are less clear. Whether these patterns indicate early evidence of a narrowing divide in eHealth technology use across population groups as a result of the narrowing divide in Internet access and computer ownership warrants further exploration. In particular, the findings emphasize the need to explore differences in the use of eHealth tools by medically underserved and disadvantaged groups. In so doing, it will be important to explore other psychosocial variables, such as health literacy, that may be better predictors of health consumers' eHealth technology adoption.",Health Informatics Journal,2011,17,3,224-243,"Lustria, Mia Liza A.; Smith, Scott Alan; Hinnant, Charles C.",Florida State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1064003479,155,"[Chang, Betty L.; Bakken, Suzanne; Brown, S.

pub.1059247049,10.1089/cpb.2007.0172,Internet Health Information in the PatientProvider Dialogue,"A patient discussing Internet health information with a health care provider (referred to as ""patient-provider communication about Internet health information"") can contribute positively to health outcomes. Although research has found that once Internet access is achieved, there are no ethnic differences in Internet health information seeking, it is unclear if there are ethnic differences in patient-provider communication about Internet health information. To help fill this gap in the literature, the National Cancer Institute's Health Information National Trends Survey 2005 was analyzed with Stata 9. Two sets of logistic regression analyses were conducted, one for a subsample of Internet users (n = 3,244) and one for a subsample of Internet users who are first-generation immigrants (n = 563). The dependent variable was patient-provider communication about Internet health information, which assessed whether survey participants had discussed online health information with a health care provider. The predictor variables included trust of health care provider, trust of online health information, Internet use, health care coverage, frequency of visits to health care provider, health status, and demographics. Among all Internet users, Whites had higher levels of patient-provider communication about Internet health information than Blacks and Asians. Similarly, among Internet users who are immigrants, Whites had higher levels of patient-provider communication about Internet health information than Blacks and Asians. While the digital divide is narrowing in terms of Internet access, racial differences in patient-provider communication about Internet health information may undermine the potential benefits of the information age.",Cyberpsychology Behavior and Social Networking,2008,11,5,587-589,"Hong, Traci",Tulane University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1059247049,20,"[Wiltshire, Jacqueline; Cronin, Kate; Sarto, Gloria E.; Brown, Roger]|[ur.01205617650.11; ; ur.0736261154.60; ur.016577225117.49]|Medical Care|2006|44|2|100-109|10.1097/01.mlr.0000196975.52557.b7|pub.1012568325|66;[Diaz, Joseph A.; Griffith, Rebecca A.; Ng, James J.; Reinert, Steven E.; Friedmann, Peter D.; Moulton, Anne W.]|[ur.01247333431.92; ur.0672511751.08; ; ur.01222706054.69; ur.0607746000.18; ur.01123166751.88]|Journal of General Internal Medicine|2002|17|3|180-185|10.1046/j.1525-1497.2002.10603.x|pub.1030249456|693;[Brodie, Mollyann; Flournoy, Rebecca E.; Altman, Drew E.; Blendon, Robert J.; Benson, John M.; Rosenbaum, Marcus D.]|[ur.01333031510.17; ur.01173504615.38; ur.01010154330.17; ur.01073262400.75; ur.0657261745.54; ur.010247461226.34]|Health Affairs|2000|19|6|255-265|10.1377/hlthaff.19.6.255|pub.1040537648|413;[Murray, Elizabeth; Lo, Bernard; Pollack, Lance; Donelan, Karen; Catania, Joe; Lee, Ken; Zapert, Kinga; Turner, Rachel]|[ur.015103066502.00; ur.01221557731.59; ur.01022145062.18; ur.01102600571.25; ur.013614277605.41; ur.01225621550.04; ur.0613126433.46; ur.01245603162.04]|Journal of Medical Internet Research|2003|5|3|e17|10.2196/jmir.5.3.e17|pub.1069286376|301;[]|[]|Social Consequences of Internet Use|2002||||10.7551/mitpress/6292.001.0001|pub.1111385931|396"

This is especially true in medically underserved populations, which are often viewed as having limited access to health information. OBJECTIVE: To improve communication between an urban health centre and the community it serves, a team of library and information science researchers undertook an assessment of patients' level and methods of access to and use of the Internet. METHODS: Data were collected in 53 face-to-face anonymous interviews with patients at the centre. Interviews were tape-recorded for referential accuracy, and data were analysed to identify patterns of access and use. RESULTS: Seventy-two percentage of study participants reported having access to the Internet through either computers or cell phones. Barriers to Internet access were predominantly lack of equipment or training rather than lack of interest. Only 21% of those with Internet access reported using the Internet to look for health information. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that lack of access to the Internet in itself is not the primary barrier to seeking health information in this population and that the digital divide exists not at the level of information access but rather at the level of information use.",Health Information & Libraries Journal,2011,29,1,61-71,"Zach, Lisl; Dalrymple, Prudence W.; Rogers, Michelle L.; Williver‐Farr, Heather",Drexel University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022242965,63,"[Chang, Betty L.; Bakken, Suzanne; Brown, S.

pub.1003333527,10.1197/jamia.m1341,Is There a Digital Divide among Physicians? A Geographic Analysis of Information Technology in Southern California Physician Offices,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether physician offices located in high-minority and low-income neighborhoods have different levels of access to information technology than offices located in lower-minority and higher-income areas. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted of pediatrics, family medicine, and general practice offices in Orange County, California. Survey data were linked with community demographic data from the 2000 Census using a geographical information system. RESULTS: Of 307 offices surveyed, 141 responded (46%). Offices located in high-minority and high-poverty areas were as likely to respond as other offices. Among responding offices, 94% had a computer, 77% had Web access, 29% had broadband Internet access, and 53% used computerized scheduling and billing systems. Offices located in minority and low-income communities had equivalent access to each technology. Offices in communities with larger proportions of Hispanics were less likely to have practice Web pages, but other uses of the Internet were not associated with practice location. Offices reported high levels of interest in online clinical systems but also high levels of concern about these systems' usability and confidentiality. Offices with Web access and those with practice management systems expressed greater interest in online clinical systems but also greater levels of concern about usability and confidentiality. These attitudes were equivalent among offices in different communities. CONCLUSION: Primary care offices located in poor and minority communities in a large, suburban county had high levels of access to and interest in Web-based systems. Physicians' offices may therefore provide a venue for online services aimed at improving health outcomes for poor and minority communities. Research is needed in other geographic regions to determine the generalizability of these findings.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,2003,10,5,484-493,"Bell, Douglas S.; Daly, Dianna M.; Robinson, Paul","University of California, Los Angeles; California State University, Northridge",United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1003333527,11,"[Brennan, Patricia Flatley; Ripich, Stefan; Moore, Shirley M.]|[ur.01241563535.02; ur.0741262634.73; ur.01005311556.85]|Journal of Community Health Nursing|1991|8|1|3-14|10.1207/s15327655jchn0801_1|pub.1001660318|60;[Cronbach, Lee J.]|[ur.013704476074.07]|Psychometrika|1951|16|3|297-334|10.1007/bf02310555|pub.1002958101|24262;[Asch, S M; Sloss, E M; Hogan, C; Brook, R H; Kravitz, R L]|[ur.014730311137.17; ur.01234340650.32; ; ur.01114465350.73; ur.0746770672.39]|JAMA|2000|284|18|2325-2333|10.1001/jama.284.18.2325|pub.1006212645|137;[Kassirer, Jerome P.]|[ur.01311762706.38]|Health Affairs|2000|19|6|115-123|10.1377/hlthaff.19.6.115|pub.1009005720|147;[Baker, Ann M.; Lafata, Jennifer Elston; Ward, Richard E.; Whitehouse, Fred; Divine, George]|[ur.01330103011.78; ur.01014667573.27; ur.0675140443.79; ur.01031305523.96; ur.0726666452.62]|The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety|2001|27|4|179-190|10.1016/s1070-3241(01)27016-3|pub.1011748016|41;[Shea, Steven; Starren, Justin; Weinstock, Ruth S.; Knudson, Paul E.; Teresi, Jeanne; Holmes, Douglas; Palmas, Walter; Field, Lesley; Goland, Robin; Tuck, Catherine; Hripcsak, George; Capps, Linnea; Liss, David]|[ur.07472701777.16; ur.01341566416.40; ur.01313332511.08; ur.0747335613.49; ur.01264607567.53; ur.01171500364.50; ur.01050352414.35; ur.01251235105.12; ur.01146361662.06; ur.01177473022.88; ur.01304304572.48; ur.01323211405.50; ]|Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|2002|9|1|49-62|10.1136/jamia.2002.0090049|pub.1011779679|145;[Brennan, Patricia Flatley; Ripich, Stefan]|[ur.01241563535.02; ur.0741262634.73]|International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care|1994|10|2|258-272|10.1017/s0266462300006218|pub.1013995922|65;[RANKIN, JOCELYN A.]|[ur.01121217226.79]|Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|1992|670|1|171-179|10.1111/j.1749-6632.1992.tb26088.x|pub.1015478249|8;[Hays, Ron D.; Hayashi, Toshi]|[ur.011301642537.47; ur.010476650533.39]|Behavior Research Methods|1990|22|2|167-175|10.3758/bf03203140|pub.1015970825|234;[BECK, J.

This paper examines the gender digital divide in Europe and presents a detailed case-study of one of the most successful e-Government systems in Greece: the Greek TAXation Information System. Surprisingly, this efficient and well-running system exhibits longstanding gender discrimination. However, the problem is not technical but legal and political and requires careful consideration, as the analysis unveils a gender digital gap in e-Government usage not only in Greece but all around Europe.",ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society,2010,40,3,50-61,"Foteinou, Georgia",University of Oxford,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1044427493,2,"[Homburg, Vincent]|[]||2008||||10.4324/9780203885642|pub.1024682902|76;[Stamoulis, D.; Gouscos, D.; Georgiadis, P.; Martakos, D.]|[; ur.010637673563.13; ur.011026145307.98; ur.011047357137.16]|Information Management & Computer Security|2001|9|4|146-153|10.1108/09685220110400327|pub.1044591821|46;[Hacker, Kenneth L.; Mason, Shana M.]|[; ]|Ethics and Information Technology|2003|5|2|99-115|10.1023/a:1024968602974|pub.1046772669|28;[van Dijk, Jan; Hacker, Kenneth]|[; ]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|315-326|10.1080/01972240309487|pub.1047421245|709;[Fink, Carsten; Kenny, Charles J.]|[ur.014324654347.78; ur.010254167455.56]|Info|2003|5|6|15-24|10.1108/14636690310507180|pub.1049974927|81;[Terpsiadou, Marianthi H.; Economides, Anastasios A.]|[; ur.011655216644.58]|Government Information Quarterly|2009|26|3|468-476|10.1016/j.giq.2009.02.004|pub.1051023242|20;[Economides, Anastasios A.; Terzis, Vasileios]|[ur.011655216644.58; ur.016141060531.57]|Electronic Government an International Journal|2008|5|3|321|10.1504/eg.2008.018878|pub.1067427577|24;[Floridi, Luciano]|[ur.015031603611.12]|Philosophy in the Contemporary World|2002|9|1|39-45|10.5840/pcw2002915|pub.1073224210|40;[Rosen, Lawrence]|[]||2006||||10.1515/9781400887583|pub.1097038514|72;[]|[]|Digital Democracy: Issues of Theory and Practice|2000||||10.4135/9781446218891|pub.1100191652|114;[Liff, Sonia; Shepherd, Adrian; Wajcman, Judy; Rice, Ronald; Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.015432352362.07; ; ur.015341463255.56; ; ur.014036273417.00]|SSRN Electronic Journal|2004||||10.2139/ssrn.1308492|pub.1102258232|52;[Bronchi, Chiara]|[ur.07750776314.26]||2001||||10.1787/668734032323|pub.1107151628|4;[Compaine, Benjamin M.]|[]|The Digital Divide|2001||||10.7551/mitpress/2419.001.0001|pub.1110922707|242;[Floridi, Luciano]|[]|SSRN Electronic Journal|1999||||10.2139/ssrn.3844352|pub.1138077047|13;[Floridi, Luciano]|[]|SSRN Electronic Journal|2002||||10.2139/ssrn.3848486|pub.1138232335|13"
pub.1000070159,10.1080/02681102.2010.504698,The digital divide: global and regional ICT leaders and followers,"The “digital divide” has sparked serious debates along the lines of economic disparity among world nations. Many in academics and policy circles believe that the digital gap could further widen the economic gap between developed versus developing nations. Among the components that are taken into consideration for measuring and analyzing the digital divide between countries, the information and communication technologies (ICTs) is the key component. This paper adds to the existing body of knowledge on the issue of regional and global digital divide by profiling 192 member countries of the United Nations based on their ICT indicators. Using clustering and statistical analysis, our results identify “leaders” and “followers” in ICT infrastructure and utilization at both regional and global settings.

pub.1047357032,10.17089/kgr.2007.14.2.002,The Impact of Digital Divide on Customer Satisfaction and Subjective Performance in Administrative Information Service: Focused on Electronic Civil Service System in Local Government,"The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of digital divide type on customer satisfaction and performance in administrative information service. Digital divide widens as the information society matures. It has been generally argued that digital divide is caused by individual characteristic differences: gender, generation, education, income, labor force status, class, region and etc. But digital divide is created, reproduced and aggravated through a very complex process. Given the assumption that digital divide is not a comprehensive concept converging into a single dimension, digital divide are articulated into the following four aspects: digital consciousness, digital accessibility, digital ability, digital usage. The empirical result indicates that (1)digital gap among residents were varied according to individual characteristic differences and digital divide type; (2)the result of the path analysis shows that digital ability and digital usage in digital divide factors affected significantly service quality and subjective performance; (3)digital consciousness, digital accessibility, digital ability, digital usage in digital divide factors were significant factor; (4)digital ability and digital usage were the most important factors, whereas digital consciousness is the least important factor in administrative information service. Finally, The prior conditions for the solution of digital divide are to draw upon a social consensus in order to provide more people with more information. In addition, it is necessary to devise relevant digital education content according to individual characteristic differences, and policy measures need to be taken to not simply enhance digital availability but to improve communicative competence.",The Korean Governance Review,2007,14,2,28-58,"Wu, Yangho; Chung, Myung-Ju",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047357032,1,
pub.1030006859,10.1016/j.compmedimag.2006.09.014,Assessment of Internet-based tele-medicine in Africa (the RAFT project),"The objectives of this paper on the Réseau Afrique Francophone de Télémédecine (RAFT) project are the evaluation of feasibility, potential, problems and risks of an Internet-based tele-medicine network in developing countries of Africa. The RAFT project was started in Western African countries 5 years ago and has now extended to other regions of Africa as well (i.e. Madagascar, Rwanda). A project for the development of a national tele-medicine network in Mali was initiated in 2001, extended to Mauritania in 2002 and to Morocco in 2003. By 2006, a total of nine countries are connected. The entire technical infrastructure is based on Internet technologies for medical distance learning and tele-consultations. The results are a tele-medicine network that has been in productive use for over 5 years and has enabled various collaboration channels, including North-to-South (from Europe to Africa), South-to-South (within Africa), and South-to-North (from Africa to Europe) distance learning and tele-consultations, plus many personal exchanges between the participating hospitals and Universities. It has also unveiled a set of potential problems: (a) the limited importance of North-to-South collaborations when there are major differences in the available resources or the socio-cultural contexts between the collaborating parties; (b) the risk of an induced digital divide if the periphery of the health system in developing countries is not involved in the development of the network; and (c) the need for the development of local medical content management skills. Particularly point (c) is improved through the collaboration between the various countries as professionals from the medical and the computer science field are sharing courses and resources. Personal exchanges between partners in the project are frequent, and several persons received an education at one of the partner Universities. As conclusion, we can say that the identified risks have to be taken into account when designing large-scale tele-medicine projects in developing countries. These problems can be mitigated by fostering South-South collaboration channels, by the use of satellite-based Internet connectivity in remote areas, the appreciation of local knowledge and its publication on-line. The availability of such an infrastructure also facilitates the development of other projects, courses, and local content creation.",Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics,2006,30,6-7,407-416,"Bagayoko, Cheick Oumar; Müller, Henning; Geissbuhler, Antoine",University Hospital of Geneva,Switzerland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030006859,42,"[Brauchli, Kurt; Oberholzer, Martin]|[ur.01227710432.20; ur.01360701342.77]|Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare|2005|11|2_suppl|3-7|10.1258/135763305775124795|pub.1002177808|40;[Ganapathy, K]|[ur.0752734432.41]|World Neurosurgery|2002|58|6|388-394|10.1016/s0090-3019(02)00924-2|pub.1003432229|30;[Oberholzer, M.; Christen, H.; Haroske, G.; Helfrich, M.; Oberli, H.; Jundt, G.; Stauch, G.; Mihatsch, M.; Brauchli, K.]|[ur.01360701342.77; ur.01312566142.86; ur.01000337762.96; ur.01253151743.14; ur.0777233432.63; ur.01174442266.96; ur.01113462032.61; ur.013571103157.06; ur.01227710432.20]|Current Problems in Dermatology|2003|32||102-114|10.1159/000067381|pub.1023507768|18;[Sarbadhikari, Suptendra Nath]|[ur.01371225501.74]|Journal of Medical Systems|2005|29|2|125-141|10.1007/s10916-005-3001-y|pub.1029329740|15;[Graham, L E; Zimmerman, M; Vassallo, D J; Patterson, V; Swinfen, P; Swinfen, R; Wootton, R]|[ur.01137463731.82; ; ur.01040205161.60; ur.014455421164.68; ur.0605547312.21; ur.01112161461.51; ur.0706274772.99]|Tropical Doctor|2003|33|1|36-38|10.1177/004947550303300118|pub.1036881619|50;[Engelmann, U; Schröter, A; Baur, U; Werner, O; Schwab, M; Müller, H; Meinzer, H P]|[ur.01202062030.92; ur.01170017067.62; ur.0773012543.83; ur.01041125743.55; ur.0722255471.17; ur.07552063233.67; ur.013024406155.66]|IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics|1998|2|1|20-25|10.1109/4233.678530|pub.1061171202|17;[Brauchli, K; O'mahony, D; Banach, L; Oberholzer, M]|[ur.01227710432.20; ur.011022546657.02; ur.01253550136.64; ur.01360701342.77]|Studies in health technology and informatics|2005|114||11-7||pub.1077058975|32;[Zolfo, Maria; Arnould, Line; Huyst, Veerle; Lynen, Lut]|[ur.01057146406.02; ur.01137347175.84; ur.01277225564.07; ur.013657055040.66]|Studies in health technology and informatics|2005|114||18-22||pub.1077058976|12;[Suri, Jasjit S; Dowling, Alan; Laxminarayan, Swamy; Singh, Sameer]|[ur.01227046462.13; ; ur.01202407014.09; ur.016226223304.32]|Studies in health technology and informatics|2005|114||140-56||pub.1077058993|5;[Kienzle, M; Curry, D; Franken, E A; Galvin, J; Hoffman, E; Holtum, E; Shope, L; Torner, J; Wakefield, D]|[ur.0575644321.39; ur.01231365716.76; ur.01041760146.01; ur.01113003403.43; ur.016425036417.05; ur.01277501116.32; ; ; ur.012377101657.30]|Journal of the Medical Library Association|1995|83|1|37-41||pub.1082472711|12;[Wright, D]|[]|Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare|1998|4 Suppl 2||1-85||pub.1083282017|31;[Meystre, S; Müller, H]|[; ]|Swiss Medical Informatics|2005|21|55|3-15|10.4414/smi.21.00082|pub.1103778152|6"

pub.1093429724,10.1109/hicss.2008.376,Rethinking the Digital Divide: Towards a Path of Digital Effectiveness,"The digital divide is a complex and dynamic phenomenon. Despite extensive studies on the digital divide and its impact, developing countries, in particular, are still searching for sustainable solutions to reduce the digital gap in order to leverage their investments in information and communication technologies (ICT) toward the attainment of greater economic and social benefits and increased global competitiveness. Research has shown that the earlier focus on this phenomenon targeted physical access and diffusion of ICT as an indicator of digital readiness to reap ICT benefits. However, there has been growing attention to the effectiveness of deployment and use. In this paper we set out to extend the analysis by providing another perspective, involving a digital effectiveness framework (DEF), which describes progressive levels of capabilities and associated benefits along a path toward digital effectiveness. The DEF is derived from the theoretical foundations and scholarly work in knowledge management, diffusion of innovation, and institutionalism and includes constructs such as knowledge acquisition, access, adoption, exploitation and innovation.

This study applied the Gowin's Vee research strategy. Through the grounded theory method, 38 critical conceptual factors were found in the literature review. These critical factors were used by the authors to develop an evaluation system for assessing the digital divide. The expert questionnaire methodology was applied and a tentative model set with 29 critical factors was generated. Using the analytic hierarchy process, the authors approached the experimental side and sent questionnaires evaluating the weight of every factor in the prototyped mechanism to Taiwan's manufacturing companies. The resulting comprehensive scale can be a useful tool for measuring the sources of the digital gap as well as for suggesting ways to encourage the adoption of ICT and e-business by SMEs in Taiwan and other countries.",Journal of Global Information Technology Management,2011,14,1,6-34,">Chang, She-I; Wu, Hsu-Che; Cho, Chili-Ming",National Chung Cheng University,Taiwan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1017920262,4,"[Okoli, Chitu; Mbarika, Victor A.

These organizations acknowledge that our planet is divided into “information haves” and “information have-nots” and that the effort to bridge this global gap is one of the main challenges of society today. Interest in digital divide is also widely present in literature. In these last five years, research and empirical surveys on this subject have notably increased (Baker, 2001; Hargittai, Di Maggio, Neuman, & Robinson, 2001; Ranieri, 2006; Rallet, 2004; Sartori, 2006; van Dijk, 2005). What does digital divide mean? What are the causes of the digital gap? How can education and technological research contribute to facing this challenge?

Design/methodology/approach The paper is a case study and is based on a survey method for collecting information through telephone (outbound call center). Besides these, internet, personal visits (as a project member) and other secondary sources such as research reports, Grameenphone internal reports, articles are used.   Findings This paper highlights the existing initiatives which are bridging the break to build digital Bangladesh and focuses on how CIC is bridging the divide.   Research limitations/implications This study will usher a new era for its internal values and the findings can be used by the advisory committees.

The authors examine whether a racial digital divide exists among college students in the odds of their using the Internet and the different levels and types of usage. Data are from a random sample of full-time, residential college freshmen. Results indicate that aspects of a digital divide exist in terms of whether one uses the Internet for specific purposes; however, once individuals begin using the Internet, few racial differences exist. Internet experience and gender affect particular types of Internet usage, suggesting that the digital divide is multilayered.

pub.1035850250,10.1108/02640470810893738,Digital divide and economic development: case study of sub‐Saharan Africa,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the nexus between the digital divide and development and discusses attempts being made at continental, regional and country levels to bridge the digital divide in sub‐Saharan Africa.   Design/methodology/approach An analytical and comparative approach of global e‐readiness, digital opportunity, and information society indices is applied to infer the status of the digital divide in sub‐Saharan Africa.   Findings The paper finds that there is a link between bridging the digital divide and economic development. However, there is as yet no unanimity as to whether the digital divide is narrowing or widening in developing countries including those in sub‐Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, countries in sub‐Saharan Africa are making tremendous strides, especially in infrastructure development and mobile phone connectivity, to bridge the digital divide.   Research limitations/implications An empirical study is needed to determine the impact of the surge in infrastructure and policy development in sub‐Saharan Africa with regard to bridging the digital divide.   Practical implications Hitherto, attempts to measure the extent of the digital divide between and within countries have largely relied on e‐readiness rankings and have rarely used other relevant indices that are available, such as e‐government, information society, and digital opportunity indices. The use of a wide range of indices to infer the breadth and depth of the digital divide between sub‐Saharan Africa and the developed world would provide a clearer picture of the extent of the divide.   Originality/value The paper demonstrates that several tools other than e‐readiness ranking can be used to measure the breadth and depth of the digital divide. The paper brings to the fore the importance of addressing sub‐Saharan Africa's digital divide peculiarities using extraordinary interventions.",The Electronic Library,2008,26,4,468-489,"Mutula, Stephen M.",University of Botswana,Botswana,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035850250,30,"[Sein, Maung K.; Harindranath, G.]|[ur.011455251557.21; ur.07777666601.86]|The Information Society|2004|20|1|15-24|10.1080/01972240490269942|pub.1003568117|140;[Hyder, Sara]|[]|The International Information & Library Review|2005|37|1|25-27|10.1080/10572317.2005.10762662|pub.1013736295|2;[Mutula, Stephen M.]|[ur.013325104101.71]|The Electronic Library|2005|23|5|591-602|10.1108/02640470510631308|pub.1018124043|24;[Mutula, Stephen M.]|[ur.013325104101.71]|Program|2005|39|2|122-138|10.1108/00330330510595706|pub.1023029087|32;[Milanovic, Branko]|[ur.07473253673.56]|The Economic Journal|2002|112|476|51-92|10.1111/1468-0297.0j673|pub.1025392747|404;[Gerhan, David R.; Mutula, Stephen M.]|[ur.07463547155.08; ur.013325104101.71]|Information Technology for Development|2007|13|2|177-197|10.1002/itdj.20060|pub.1044146911|8;[]|[]|World Pumps|2007|2007|493|6|10.1016/s0262-1762(07)70338-3|pub.1048202068|2;[Hyder, Sara]|[]|The International Information & Library Review|2005|37|1|25-27|10.1016/j.iilr.2005.02.001|pub.1052596003|6;[Kao, A]|[]|The AMA Journal of Ethic|2001|3|3||10.1001/virtualmentor.2001.3.3.dykn1-0103|pub.1054167903|14;[Adam, Lishan; Wood, Frances]|[ur.016605630510.53; ur.011142652601.87]|Journal of Information Science|1999|25|4|307-318|10.1177/016555159902500407|pub.1063752236|44;[Bourguignon, François; Morrisson, Christian]|[ur.015736024637.73; ur.010127501165.49]|American Economic Review|2002|92|4|727-744|10.1257/00028280260344443|pub.1064523932|680;[Birdsall, William F.]|[]|First Monday|2000|5|12||10.5210/fm.v5i12.820|pub.1072710536|12"

pub.1064711405,10.1287/isre.1090.0273,Conceptualizing and Testing a Social Cognitive Model of the Digital Divide,"The digital divide has loomed as a public policy issue for over a decade. Yet, a theoretical account for the effects of the digital divide is currently lacking. This study examines three levels of the digital divide. The digital access divide (the first-level digital divide) is the inequality of access to information technology (IT) in homes and schools. The digital capability divide (the second-level digital divide) is the inequality of the capability to exploit IT arising from the first-level digital divide and other contextual factors. The digital outcome divide (the third-level digital divide) is the inequality of outcomes (e.g., learning and productivity) of exploiting IT arising from the second-level digital divide and other contextual factors. Drawing on social cognitive theory and computer self-efficacy literature, we developed a model to show how the digital access divide affects the digital capability divide and the digital outcome divide among students. The digital access divide focuses on computer ownership and usage in homes and schools. The digital capability divide and the digital outcome divide focus on computer self-efficacy and learning outcomes, respectively. This model was tested using data collected from over 4,000 students in Singapore. The results generate insights into the relationships among the three levels of the digital divide and provide a theoretical account for the effects of the digital divide. While school computing environments help to increase computer self-efficacy for all students, these factors do not eliminate knowledge the gap between students with and without home computers. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.",Information Systems Research,2011,22,1,170-187,"Wei, Kwok-Kee; Teo, Hock-Hai; Chan, Hock Chuan; Tan, Bernard C.

One of the key objectives of the IDI is to help monitor and assess the digital divide, and highlight areas for improvement. The chapter starts by looking at the IDI by level of development (developed/developing). It then presents an analysis of the digital divide using the methodology developed by Orbicom (2003), which was also used in the previous edition of this publication (ITU, 2009b). The final section presents the concept of time distance, an alternative way of looking at the digital divide.",,2010,,,,ITU,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107218529,0,

Consequently, the following phases of development are crucial for the region: (1) the phase of massive digitalization during which the digital divide is bridged and (2) the phase of information and knowledge management in which information is systematically converted into knowledge and the latter into innovative-sustainable development. Information for conversion into knowledge is supplied by the first phase. The second phase is therefore existence dependent on the first. Therefore, the attainment of digitalized state is primary-sine qua non. The envisaged digitalized state can be actualized and consolidated with a combination of: (a) curriculum in computer education consisting of computer taxonomy, networking and ICTS in general for secondary and tertiary institutions but also aptly adoptable for informal groups and (b) establishment of multipurpose telecentres in rural areas and a diffusion of networks in urban centres. Once a steady digitalized state evidenced by uninterrupted connectivity to the internet is attained, the second phase can be realized. Without steady supply of electricity, however, sustainable development and competitive edge may be hard to come by in a world of fierce competition.",Information Technology Journal,2007,6,2,166-173,"Agbeja, Oyedokun; Salawu, R.O.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028042411,1,"[Kobrin, Stephen J.]|[]|The Globalization of Multinational Enterprise Activity and Economic Development|2000|||133-154|10.1057/9780230599161_6|pub.1000096309|21;[Stulz, René M.]|[ur.015317367271.10]|Journal of Applied Corporate Finance|1995|8|3|30-38|10.1111/j.1745-6622.1995.tb00634.x|pub.1047664863|64"

An overview of research published in the last 20 years draws to the conclusion that females are at a disadvantage relative to men when learning about computers or learning other material with the aid of computer-assisted software. The evidence shows that the digital divide affects people of all ages and across international boundaries. We suggest that the digital divide is fundamentally a problem of computer anxiety whose roots are deep in socialization patterns of boys and girls and that interact with the stereotype of computers as toys for boys. A model of the digital divide is presented that examines gender stereotypes, attribution patterns, and stereotype threat as antecedents of computer anxiety. Computer anxiety in turn leads to differences in computer attitudes and computer performance.

pub.1046538258,10.1002/meet.1450420166,Consumer health digital divide: A research agenda for studying inequality in online health information access and use,"Driven by social, economic, academic and technological forces, the new field of E-health has been developing quickly in recent years. Many E-health applications are Internet-based and therefore have the potential to help people throughout the world. However, this high dependence on the Internet also raises sobering questions about a health digital divide, i.e. unequal access and use as well as unequal rights to gain benefits of online information among health consumers. In this paper, we discuss social, cultural and economic factors which shape a research agenda for examining health digital divide issues. These factors are derived by means of a literature review. Future research questions include how to solve the discrepancies between health digital divide and digital divide among the general population, what is the role of content prejudice in health digital divide, and what is the status quo of health digital divide in developing countries, et al.",Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,2006,42,1,n/a-n/a,"Chong, Jing",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046538258,0,"[Hanauer, David; Dibble, Emily; Fortin, Jennifer; Col, Nananda F]|[ur.0753537546.10; ur.01264762204.35; ur.0742621044.84; ur.0625641250.34]|Journal of American College Health|2004|52|5|197-202|10.3200/jach.52.5.197-202|pub.1000898407|72;[Chang, Betty L.; Bakken, Suzanne; Brown, S.

pub.1049584626,10.1007/s10796-011-9297-x,Study of the digital divide evaluation model for government agencies–a Taiwanese local government’s perspective,"Many countries have devoted increasing attention to information infrastructures. However, a gap in digitalization exists among different government agencies, causing unequal opportunities for accessing infrastructures, information, and communication technologies. This paper, based on Gowin’s Vee structure, is an empirical study of the digital divide in the context of local governments in Taiwan. A model for identifying and measuring aforementioned digital divide is constructed in this paper. We first refer to the grounded theory to draft a framework for measuring the digital divide in local governments. Then, through the use of a questionnaire distributed to experts implemented alongside the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), we generate five dimensions (including ICT infrastructure, human resources, external environment, internals of organization, and information) and 42 measures. Finally, we measure the actual levels of the digital divide in local governments with the resulting digital divide evaluation model. This paper aims to generate results that can serve as a reference for government agencies (at all levels) in the formulation of their digitalization strategies. Moreover, the digital divide evaluation model constructed in this study goes beyond existing measures and may serve as a reference for academics in the examination of methods to narrow the digital divide in various levels of governmental bodies.

This article investigates the determinants of digital divide in individual ecommerce utilization in the Chinese context. The study focuses on two types of effects at the individual level: the first order digital divide in access to Internet and the second order digital divide in ecommerce utilization.

Discourse on the digital divide began in the mid-1990s and continues today. Data analysis reveals that divides still exist, particularly when considering income, education, region, disability, age, and race. Librarians face many challenges to take on the digital divide. These challenges include issues of access, content, technical literacy, privacy, civic participation, education, employment, non-use, and political debate. Yet for each challenge, there is an opportunity for the ER librarians to thrive while they face down the digital divide.",Collection Management,2007,32,3-4,327-349,"MLIS, Tawnya K.

pub.1044336053,10.1080/1097198x.2010.10856513,Crossing the Chasm - Understanding China's Rural Digital Divide,"The digital divide is a mounting concern for economic growth and social development of developing countries. As the largest developing country, China has a severe digital divide in rural areas. As part of the endeavor to build a harmonious society, China has devoted tremendous resources to bridging the rural digital divide; however, the results are thus far inconclusive. To better understand and tackle China's rural digital divide, theoretically grounded empirical research is needed. Drawing upon the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study aims to understand the critical reasons that essentially caused China's rural digital divide. The model is empirically tested using the survey data collected from 924 Chinese Internet users. The results reveal distinct behavioral models between rural and urban users.

pub.1018124043,10.1108/02640470510631308,Bridging the digital divide through e‐governance,"Purpose The paper aims to present the status of the digital divide in Africa and the implications for libraries, and to demonstrate that, contrary to recent published findings, the digital divide is not narrowing.   Design/methodology/approach A general literature review is undertaken, along with a case study of the digital divide in an academic setting.   Findings Africa still suffers from rampant poverty, and consequently resources that could be utilised to bridge the digital divide are directed at meeting peoples basic survival needs, including food, shelter, health care, housing, etc. Additionally, governments are increasingly adopting e‐government initiatives that libraries could explore for automation.   Research limitations/implications More research is needed to show why – given that the gap between rich and poor countries is increasing, and that economic development is a good predictor of ICT uptake – that the digital divide between developed and developing countries is claimed to be narrowing.   Practical implications Libraries have the potential to use e‐government initiatives for automation, but they need to exert influence on their governments through advocacy and other measures.   Originality/value Few studies, especially in Africa, have explored the potential of e‐governance for library automation. Similarly, issues of the digital divide have in the past been looked at largely from international and national perspectives, with little attention being paid to the existence of the phenomenon within libraries. Finally, existing studies on the digital divide largely use ICT metrics without paying much attention to the totality of other variables that influence the digital divide. This paper provides a proposal on how e‐governance could be used to narrow the digital divide within libraries in Africa.",The Electronic Library,2005,23,5,591-602,"Mutula, Stephen M.",University of Botswana,Botswana,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018124043,24,"[Miller, Chris]|[]|AfP|2002|31|9|792||pub.1075181232|1"

pub.1043729182,10.1007/978-3-540-30078-6_49,An Integrated Framework for Analyzing Domestic and International Digital Divides,"Digital divides have become an important issue that attracts a great attention of almost every country in the world and major international organizations. However, few or none of the previous researches have taken into account both domestic and international digital divide issues at the same time and offered an integrated view to structurally illustrate these issues from various aspects. The goal of this paper is to propose an integrated framework for assessing and analyzing domestic and international digital divides of a country or a group of countries. Situations of digital divides in Taiwan, three other industrialized economies in southeastern Asia, and four northern European countries are examined and compared based on the framework. Related e-government strategies for bridging the divides are also discussed.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2004,3183,,293-299,"Yu, Chien-Chih; Wang, Hsing-I",National Chengchi University,Taiwan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043729182,4,"[Wong, Poh-Kam]|[ur.015333364767.86]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|167-187|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00065-8|pub.1002363516|85;[Servaes, Jan; Heinderyckx, Francois]|[ur.010751772465.57; ur.012733526033.47]|Telematics and Informatics|2002|19|2|91-115|10.1016/s0736-5853(01)00008-9|pub.1002551163|19;[Lu, Ming-te]|[ur.015276504143.90]|Journal of Global Information Technology Management|2001|4|3|1-4|10.1080/1097198x.2001.10856304|pub.1012019015|44;[Kim, Mun-Cho; Kim, Jong-Kil]|[ur.010401355771.29; ]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2001|2105||78-91|10.1007/3-540-47749-7_6|pub.1026084170|30;[Jalava, Jukka; Pohjola, Matti]|[ur.012713076467.26; ur.013107663011.00]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|189-210|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00066-x|pub.1026761325|140;[Iyer, Lakshmi S.; Taube, Larry; Raquet, Julia]|[ur.07566015351.69; ; ]|Journal of Global Information Technology Management|2002|5|1|43-68|10.1080/1097198x.2002.10856319|pub.1029436209|13;[Adams, Owen]|[]|Government Information Quarterly|2000|27|2|245-246|10.1016/s1352-0237(00)00138-6|pub.1048829755|17;[Corrocher, Nicoletta; Ordanini, Andrea]|[ur.011256716263.36; ur.015022300133.21]|Journal of Information Technology|2002|17|1|9-19|10.1080/02683960210132061|pub.1058311977|116;[Yu, Chien-Chih; Wang, Hsing-I]|[; ]|Electronic Government an International Journal|2004|1|2|179|10.1504/eg.2004.005177|pub.1067427450|8;[Brown, Cheryl L.]|[]|Proceedings of the 35th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|2002|||10-19|10.1109/hicss.2002.994085|pub.1093299697|7"

pub.1042489310,10.1177/0018726709104545,The silent community: Organizing zones in the digital divide,"This article is a critical interrogation of scholarship on digital divides as it pertains to development in the so-called `Third World'. The article proceeds by identifying three problematic assumptions of extant research on digital divides in the context of development: the discursive binarization between `haves' and `have-nots'; the normatization of the digital divide; and the unproblematic representation of local community interests. The article then uses a longitudinal case study of one particular Non-Government Organization (NGO) that attempted to develop a system of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) over a 10-year period. Three phases of ICT development are identified: an initial phase, a growth phase, and a consolidation phase. The historical development of ICT in the NGO is used to interrogate the three assumptions of digital divide literature, highlighting its role in organizing digital zones.

pub.1002642735,10.1080/01972240600904076,Methodological Challenges of Digital Divide Measurements,"The term “digital divide” has been used for almost a decade and typically relates to sociodemographic differences in the use of information and communication technology. However, the corresponding measurement is still relatively imprecise. Very often it is simply reduced to comparisons of Internet penetration rates. This article extends the measurements above the usual bivariate comparisons. Within this context, three essential approaches are presented and critically evaluated. First, loglinear modeling is used to address the interactions among the factors affecting the digital divide. Second, compound measures (i.e., the Digital Divide Index) that integrate a number of variables into a single indicator are discussed. Third, time-distance methodology is applied to analyze changes in the digital divide. The article argues that these approaches often yield entirely different conclusions compared to simple bivariate analysis. The examples are presented as a general warning against an oversimplified methodological approach to digital divide studies.",The Information Society,2006,22,5,279-290,"Vehovar, Vasja; Sicherl, Pavle; Hüsing, Tobias; Dolnicar, Vesna",University of Ljubljana,Slovenia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002642735,135,"[Quibria, M.G; Ahmed, Shamsun N; Tschang, Ted; Reyes-Macasaquit, Mari-Len]|[ur.015764721413.10; ur.010654611213.10; ur.012247552213.80; ur.015235454213.44]|Journal of Asian Economics|2003|13|6|811-825|10.1016/s1049-0078(02)00186-0|pub.1000815131|147;[Katz, James; Aspden, Philip]|[ur.011125014303.05; ur.011004276717.53]|Internet Research|1997|7|3|170-188|10.1108/10662249710171814|pub.1002872177|179;[Sicherl, Pavle]|[ur.014743726325.64]|Kyklos|1973|26|3|559-575|10.1111/j.1467-6435.1973.tb01881.x|pub.1007245014|21;[Petrič, Gregor]|[ur.01232436122.58]|The Information Society|2006|22|5|291-301|10.1080/01972240600904159|pub.1013058870|17;[Cullen, Rowena]|[ur.01027321712.95]|Online Information Review|2001|25|5|311-320|10.1108/14684520110410517|pub.1029188033|162;[Pruulmann-Vengerfeldt, Pille]|[ur.014105615271.31]|The Information Society|2006|22|5|303-310|10.1080/01972240600904233|pub.1031311915|8;[JUNG, JOO-YOUNG; QIU, JACK LINCHUAN; KIM, YONG-CHAN]|[; ur.013507560427.54; ]|Communication Research|2001|28|4|507-535|10.1177/009365001028004006|pub.1036789520|171;[DiMaggio, Paul; Hargittai, Eszter; Neuman, W.

pub.1015652973,10.1108/14779960380000230,Ethical reflections on the digital divide,"During the past decade, a fairly extensive literature on the digital divide has emerged. Many reports and studies have provided statistical data (Digital Divide Network, 2002; NTIA, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2000) pertaining to sociological aspects of ‘the divide,’ while some studies have examined policy issues involving universal service (Camp and Tsong, 2001) and universal access (Brewer and Chuter, 2002). Other studies have suggested ways in which the digital divide could be better understood if it were ‘reconceptualized’ in terms of an alternative metaphor, e.g. a ‘divide’ having to do with literacy (Warschauer, 2002), power (Moss, 2002), content (Carvin, 2000), or the (information) environment (Floridi, 2001). However, with the exception of Johnson (2001) and Koehler (2002), authors have tended not to question ‐ at least not directly ‐ whether the digital divide is, at bottom, an ethical issue. Many authors seem to assume that because disparities involving access to computing technology exist, issues underlying the digital divide are necessarily moral in nature. Many further assume that because this particular ‘divide’ has to do with something that is digital or technological in nature, it is best understood as a computer ethical issue. The present study, which examines both assumptions, considers four questions: (1) What exactly is the digital divide? (2) Is this ‘divide’ ultimately an ethical issue? (3) Assuming that the answer to (2) is ‘yes,’ is the digital divide necessarily an issue for computer ethics? (4) If the answer to (3) is ‘yes,’ what can/should computer professionals do bridge the digital divide?",Journal of Information Communication and Ethics in Society,2003,1,2,99-108,"Tavani, Herman T",Rivier University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015652973,7,"[]|[]|ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society|2001|31|3|9-14|10.1145/504696.504698|pub.1003432695|8;[Monahan, Torin]|[ur.0732002560.48]|ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society|2001|31|3|22-31|10.1145/504696.504700|pub.1010779846|6;[Grodzinsky, Frances S.; Tavani, Herman T.]|[ur.012403605437.72; ur.014153265602.68]|ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society|2002|32|1|22-32|10.1145/511134.511138|pub.1030435925|6;[Camp, L.

pub.1028969549,10.3329/jbayr.v1i1.6839,"Bridging the digital divide through public, school and college libraries: Case study of Bangladesh","The least developed and developing countries are combating against digital divide in order to keep the wheel of development rolling and escape from the vicious circle of poverty as digital divide is one of the key factors that can lead the poverty situation of these nations to an extreme level. In Bangladesh, the digital divide condition is severe. Therefore it is imperative for Bangladesh to take fruitful steps to bridge the digital divide and to ensure ICT facilities at the national level. Recently as government pledged to convert Bangladesh into Digital Bangladesh by 2021 which is the golden jubilee year of Bangladesh independence, several initiatives have been taken to overcome the digital divide and to produce future qualified generations. However, it has been observed that no worth mentioning project has been taken by any government that ensures proper development of public, school and college libraries. Government should realize the fact that complete development of the country is never possible unless we concentrate library based education. It is not possible for any government to ensure computer with internet connection to each and every family in Bangladesh, however, it is possible to ensure ICTs at school, college and public libraries. The author of this paper firmly believe that ensuring ICTs to public, school and college libraries will greatly reduce digital divide at the national level and will produce qualified, efficient, ICT competent future generations. In this paper an attempt has been made by the authors to show the existing digital divide in the country, current ICT scenario and core projects that have taken by government, non-government, donor agencies and other development organization. The main object of this paper is to show how public, school and college libraries can reduce digital divide at the national level. It is believed that coordinated, long-term, effective projects/programme to reduce digital divide will ensure peaceful, educated, qualified, ICT competent future generations.

In this paper, we examine the nature of the Digital Divide in the Maldives – between the nation’s capital and the Atolls, between the Atolls and across the nation, and the evolution of these divides over time. In order to inform more effective policy interventions, we also attempt at identifying clusters within the country that share similar Digital Divide concerns. The results show significant disparities in the penetration of digital technologies. While we can observe the narrowing of the Digital Divide over time, the divide remains significant between the capital and the rest of the nation.

pub.1093493232,10.1109/icds.2010.54,The Digital Divide and Internet Voting Acceptance,"Governments and corporations are increasingly considering the use of the Internet for individuals to cast votes. Yet, not everyone has access to and is comfortable with the use of technology. This is the problem of the digital divide. This study explores the impact of the digital divide on Internet voting (I-voting). A model of I-voting and the digital divide is proposed. The proposed model suggests that age, income, education and frequency of Internet use have an impact on I-voting utilization. To test the model both an online and paper-based version of the survey was administered to a large sample of citizens. The results of multiple linear regressions indicate that age and income (access and skills) have a significant impact on Internet voting. These findings indicate that, like other e-government services, I-voting is subject to the barriers associated with the digital divide, and this digital divide introduces several challenges to government agencies.",2010 Fourth International Conference on Digital Society,2010,,,307-310,"Bélanger, France; Carter, Lemuria",Virginia Tech; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093493232,13,"[Bélanger, France; Carter, Lemuria]|[ur.07347634165.87; ur.010501313522.42]|The Journal of Strategic Information Systems|2008|17|2|165-176|10.1016/j.jsis.2007.12.002|pub.1001223371|685;[Bimber, Bruce]|[ur.0601135754.09]|Political Research Quarterly|2001|54|1|53-67|10.1177/106591290105400103|pub.1004672061|313;[Jackson, Linda A.; von Eye, Alexander; Barbatsis, Gretchen; Biocca, Frank; Fitzgerald, Hiram E.; Zhao, Yong]|[ur.01070755763.48; ur.01042557654.26; ur.01253317563.89; ur.014637772363.10; ur.0662366733.26; ur.01271544433.04]|Communications of the ACM|2004|47|7|43-47|10.1145/1005817.1005819|pub.1028655851|31;[Solop, Frederic I.]|[ur.010235231635.40]|Political Science and Politics|2001|34|2|289-293|10.1017/s104909650100052x|pub.1036119184|57;[Bélanger, France; Carter, Lemuria]|[ur.07347634165.87; ur.010501313522.42]|Communications of the ACM|2009|52|4|132-135|10.1145/1498765.1498801|pub.1042734858|176;[Citrin, Jack; Schickler, Eric; Sides, John]|[ur.012112175327.14; ur.015233403170.37; ur.010161671065.98]|American Journal of Political Science|2003|47|1|75-90|10.1111/1540-5907.00006|pub.1048007347|147;[Eliasson, Charlott; Zúquete, André]|[ur.0611043056.14; ur.015022541167.62]|Internet Research|2006|16|5|507-518|10.1108/10662240610710987|pub.1051797919|6;[Oostveen, Anne-Marie; Van Den Besselaar, Peter]|[ur.015534400421.73; ur.012114761217.04]|Javnost - The Public|2004|11|1|61-78|10.1080/13183222.2004.11008847|pub.1052816503|28;[Thomas, J.

Traditional village and industrialized village represent two types of rural China’s social structure, which provide a good case for studying the digital divide between different types of villages. We consider the gap formed in possessing information and communication technologies(ICTs) as the primary divide, and take the gap formed in using ICTs as the secondary divide. Moreover, a “mutual reproduction” effect exists between the divides formed in the course of possessing and using ICTs. Finally we pointed out that cell phones, as a mobile network, may become the first carrier of the integration of the future information technology and an effective agent weapon helps bridging the digital divide.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2009,5623,,347-355,"Chen, Peng; Wang, Jieping; Si, Zuoxian; Wang, Jie; Liu, Ying",Tsinghua University; Nokia (China),China; China,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1036028062,1,"[Harwit, Eric]|[]|The China Quarterly|2004|180||1010-1030|10.1017/s0305741004000724|pub.1053922320|56;[Granovetter, Mark]|[]|American Journal of Sociology|1985|91|3|481-510|10.1086/228311|pub.1058547809|17696;[Lucky, Robert W.]|[]|Lucky Strikes...Again|2010||||10.1109/9780470545164.ch52|pub.1086100367|63"
pub.1002854665,10.1016/j.iilr.2005.07.001,Bridging the digital divide in Sub-Saharan Africa: The rural challenge in Uganda,"A study was conducted in 2002/2003 to investigate and assess the strategies of bridging the digital divide in Uganda. Data were collected qualitatively using semi-structured interviews. The study focused in depth on a relatively small sample of people concerned with the digital divide.

Design/methodology/approach The method used is an innovative form of document availability test developed to measure the extent of the digital divide between a service offered by a university library in a developed (Western) tertiary education system (Curtin University of Technology, Western Australia) and one offered by a university library in a developing Arab country (Yarmouk University, Jordan). The method tests differences in capacity to deliver content according to format (digital or print) and tests for differences in digital access to both “international” and “local” content experienced by users of the two libraries.   Findings The findings indicate the existence of a digital divide, but also suggest that the availability of digital content has helped overcome the substantial scholarly information divide.   Research limitations/implications The research has implications for academic libraries in developing Arab countries as they attempt to redress the effects of the digital divide.   Originality/value The paper uses an innovative methodology for measuring the digital divide, and represents the first attempt to quantify the effects of the digital divide as it impacts upon the users of an academic library in a developing Arab country.",Library Review,2010,59,6,384-400,"Obeidat, Othman; Genoni, Paul",Al-Balqa` Applied University; Curtin University,Jordan; Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040954241,0,"[Hill, Carole E.; Loch, Karen D.; Straub, Detmar; El-Sheshai, Kamal]|[ur.0633737164.28; ur.013651545512.31; ur.012470601004.22; ]|Journal of Global Information Management|1998|6|3|29-38|10.4018/jgim.1998070103|pub.1006141016|122;[de Munster, Irene L.]|[]|Collection Building|2005|24|4|133-136|10.1108/01604950510629309|pub.1014716527|5;[Omekwu, Charles Obiora]|[ur.012070724765.34]|The Electronic Library|2006|24|6|847-863|10.1108/02640470610714260|pub.1019755756|18;[Salinas, Romelia]|[ur.012360161067.24]|Collection Building|2003|22|3|131-136|10.1108/01604950310484456|pub.1025839156|9;[Straub, Detmar; Loch, Karen D.; Hill, Carole E.]|[ur.012470601004.22; ur.013651545512.31; ur.0633737164.28]|Journal of Global Information Management|2001|9|4|6-28|10.4018/jgim.2001100101|pub.1033393358|149;[Aqili, Seyed Vahid; Moghaddam, Alireza Isfandyari]|[ur.012206713247.87; ur.013204666226.17]|The Electronic Library|2008|26|2|226-237|10.1108/02640470810864118|pub.1038905116|37;[Ghosh, S.B.; Kumar Das, Anup]|[; ]|IFLA Journal|2007|33|3|229-250|10.1177/0340035207083304|pub.1040171247|46;[Warschauer, Mark]|[]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|297-304|10.1080/01972240309490|pub.1051403945|133;[Brown, C.

First, I criticize policymakers who rely on simplistic measures of the digital divide, at the expense of a thoughtful analysis of (1) the purpose of the tool, (2) the level of observation, and (3) the method of approaching the data. Second, I argue that networks and associated technologies are not neutral artifacts but are political and social spaces in their structure as well as in their content levels. Accordingly, we need to factor in the context as an important actor in conceptualizing and measuring the digital divide. Third, two general types of indices are used for the measurement of the digital divide(s): focused monotopical indices and comprehensive indices. Monotopical indices are more widely available, while comprehensive ones are rare. I argue that policymakers need to promote comprehensive indices over monotopical indices.

pub.1016306614,10.1080/01972243.2011.548695,Who's Responsible for the Digital Divide? Public Perceptions and Policy Implications,"Addressing the reasons for—and the solutions to—the “digital divide” has been on the public agenda since the emergence of the Internet. However, the term has meant quite different things, depending on the audience and the context, and these competing interpretations may in fact orient toward different policy outcomes. The goals of this article are twofold. First, the authors unpack the term “digital divide” and examine how it has been deployed and interpreted across a range of academic and policy discourses. Second, through a framing experiment embedded within a nationally representative survey, the authors demonstrate how presenting respondents with two different conceptual frames of the digital divide may lead to different perceptions of who is most accountable for addressing the issue. From this, they discuss the dynamic relationship between the construction and communication of policy discourse and the public understanding of the digital divide, as well as implications for effective communication about the digital divide and information and communication technology policy to the general public.",The Information Society,2011,27,2,92-104,"Epstein, Dmitry; Nisbet, Erik C.; Gillespie, Tarleton",Cornell University; The Ohio State University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016306614,87,"[Stevenson, Siobhan]|[]|The Information Society|2009|25|1|1-22|10.1080/01972240802587539|pub.1000580777|54;[Vehovar, Vasja; Sicherl, Pavle; Hüsing, Tobias; Dolnicar, Vesna]|[ur.010323146000.99; ur.014743726325.64; ; ur.015216142421.66]|The Information Society|2006|22|5|279-290|10.1080/01972240600904076|pub.1002642735|135;[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|New Media & Society|2004|6|3|341-362|10.1177/1461444804042519|pub.1003317453|630;[Benford, Robert D.; Snow, David A.]|[ur.012634714515.25; ]|Annual Review of Sociology|2000|26|1|611-639|10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.611|pub.1003440162|4895;[Clark, Lynn Schofield; Demont-Heinrich, Christof; Webber, Scott A.]|[ur.012311014301.62; ur.012073130167.53; ur.012344406101.02]|New Media & Society|2004|6|4|529-547|10.1177/146144804044333|pub.1006901520|32;[Rooney, David]|[ur.012001600321.41]|Telematics and Informatics|2005|22|4|405-422|10.1016/j.tele.2004.11.007|pub.1008940662|135;[van Dijk, Jan A.G.M.]|[ur.016570250333.33]|Poetics|2006|34|4-5|221-235|10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004|pub.1014130665|741;[Scheufele, DA]|[ur.01317422740.29]|Journal of Communication|1999|49|1|103-122|10.1111/j.1460-2466.1999.tb02784.x|pub.1017738625|1745;[Chong, Dennis; Druckman, James N.]|[ur.016565167117.15; ur.0643027777.60]|Annual Review of Political Science|2007|10|1|103-126|10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.072805.103054|pub.1018365195|1781;[Iannuzzi, Patricia]|[]|Community & Junior College Libraries|2000|9|4|63-67|10.1300/j107v09n04_09|pub.1023634447|314;[Stewart, Concetta M.; Gil-Egui, Gisela; Tian, Yan; Pileggi, Mairi Innes]|[ur.012412707413.07; ur.010435760017.01; ur.012756254741.68; ur.014005650413.48]|New Media & Society|2006|8|5|731-751|10.1177/1461444806067585|pub.1025490434|12;[Kvasny, Lynette; Truex, Duane]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.013072777061.80]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2001|66||399-414|10.1007/978-0-387-35489-7_27|pub.1030914962|22;[Hardisty, David J.; Johnson, Eric J.; Weber, Elke U.]|[ur.01215432046.48; ur.01324023154.96; ur.01307416713.88]|Psychological Science|2009|21|1|86-92|10.1177/0956797609355572|pub.1032662115|204;[Gunkel, David J.]|[]|New Media & Society|2003|5|4|499-522|10.1177/146144480354003|pub.1038412444|201;[Thompson, Mark]|[]|Review of African Political Economy|2004|31|99|103-123|10.1080/0305624042000258441|pub.1042226795|55;[Scheufele, Dietram A.; Tewksbury, David]|[ur.01317422740.29; ur.011333456643.25]|Journal of Communication|2006|57|1|9-20|10.1111/j.0021-9916.2007.00326.x|pub.1044876152|1206;[Barzilai-Nahon, Karine]|[ur.014613452655.40]|The Information Society|2006|22|5|269-278|10.1080/01972240600903953|pub.1044908392|224;[van Dijk, Jan; Hacker, Kenneth]|[; ]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|315-326|10.1080/01972240309487|pub.1047421245|709;[Entman, Robert M.]|[]|Journal of Communication|1993|43|4|51-58|10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01304.x|pub.1050720348|6849;[Nelson, Thomas E.; Oxley, Zoe M.; Clawson, Rosalee A.]|[ur.010271015742.84; ur.016460477031.34; ur.01147547430.17]|Political Behavior|1997|19|3|221-246|10.1023/a:1024834831093|pub.1053397771|593;[Gamson, William A.; Modigliani, Andre]|[ur.016514654271.70; ur.011404544071.44]|American Journal of Sociology|1989|95|1|1-37|10.1086/229213|pub.1058548711|2764;[NAGELKERKE, N.

In the U.S., we witnessed a massive infusion of computers and Internet access in homes, schools, libraries, and other neighborhood institutions. This has significantly increased citizens’ physical access to information and communication technology (ICT) artifacts and has enhanced citizens’ opportunities for acquiring and strengthening technical skills. However, does increased physical access and technical skills signal closure of the digital divide? In this chapter, I address this question by describing the preconstructed ways in which the digital divide is conceptualized by academics and policymakers, and inferring what these conceptualizations suggest about the existential significance of the digital divide as experienced by historically underserved groups in the U.S.",Information Technology Ethics,2007,,,200-212,"Hongladarom, Soraj; Ess, Charles; Kvasny, L.",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016867393,3,

It examines the sociodemographic topology of the digital divide in an extensive crossnational analysis covering six sociodemographic factors and twenty-five countries. The findings contradict in part the conclusions of previous research. Although there are differences between the social groups, not all of the tested segmentation factors mark major fault lines of the digital divide. The notions of a gender gap, an income divide, and a divide between urban and rural areas are rejected because between-group disparity proves to be only minor in comparison to overall inequality. However, education, age, and main vocational activity do indeed mark digital boundaries in many of the observed countries.",The Information Society,2011,27,3,141-157,"Lengsfeld, Jörn H.B.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1006014757,44,"[Vehovar, Vasja; Sicherl, Pavle; Hüsing, Tobias; Dolnicar, Vesna]|[ur.010323146000.99; ur.014743726325.64; ; ur.015216142421.66]|The Information Society|2006|22|5|279-290|10.1080/01972240600904076|pub.1002642735|135;[Menou, Michel J.; Taylor, Richard D.]|[ur.07457772727.26; ]|The Information Society|2006|22|5|261-267|10.1080/01972240600903904|pub.1015253577|37;[Ono, Hiroshi; Zavodny, Madeline]|[ur.01306451573.22; ur.01076707606.12]|Social Science Research|2007|36|3|1135-1155|10.1016/j.ssresearch.2006.09.001|pub.1030703634|171;[Barzilai-Nahon, Karine]|[ur.014613452655.40]|The Information Society|2006|22|5|269-278|10.1080/01972240600903953|pub.1044908392|224;[Shannon, C.

Findings The findings of the survey show the prevalence of various forms of digital divide such as gender, marital status, age and educational level of the internet users in Nigeria.   Practical implication The federal/state governments as well as university managements in Nigeria should formulate relevant policies to reduce various forms of digital divide that are prevalent in the Nigeria.

However, prior studies on the global digital divide have addressed the issue mainly from a cross-sectional perspective. This article attempts to examine the topic from a longitudinal perspective by using the Bass new product diffusion model, which has been successfully applied in diffusion studies over the past four decades. Summarizing information from an empirical study on 48 countries, the modeling framework finds three types of divide dynamics; assesses the severity of the global digital divide at various Internet diffusion stages; and identifies cultural, economic, and educational factors as the major causes of the global digital divide at different stages.

This has significantly increased citizens’ physical access to information and communication technology (ICT) artifacts and has enhanced citizens’ opportunities for acquiring and strengthening technical skills. However, does increased physical access and technical skills signal closure of the digital divide?

pub.1033243853,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2006.05.003,Measuring Internet usage: The Israeli case,"The article describes two instruments for measuring Internet Usage and the changes in subjects’ Internet usage following a controlled intervention. It focuses on the use of usage and lack of usage for measuring the digital gap. The “digital gap” is defined as the gap between individuals with and without access to technology (telephones, computers, Internet access) and related services. Since its emergence, the Internet has become the most important form of information and communication technology (ICT).The goal of the present research was to develop ways of measuring Internet usage for different segments of the Israeli population (it can also be used to measure Internet usage outside Israel). For the past few years, the Israeli government has sponsored programs designed to increase Internet usage in specific segments of the Israeli population. Some of these programs have been “controlled programs”. Controlled Internet Usage Programs are planned and monitored programs, which use research methods to discover whether they have increased Internet usage and changed Internet habits.The population of Internet users in Israel is presently 45.8% (compared with 68.2% in the US population). The past 5 years has witnessed a significant rise in the number of Internet users in the West in general and in Israel specifically: an increase of 152% in the number of Israeli households connected to the Internet during the period 2000–2005.However, large differences are apparent between the stronger and weaker sections of the Israeli population where the Internet is concerned, and controlled intervention is therefore a very important means of reducing these discrepancies.The present article describes two measurement instruments: the first instrument examines on-line proficiency, while the second determines patterns of Internet use and the status of respondents’ “Internet awareness”.The instruments were built to determine the reduction in the digital divide associated with Internet usage following controlled intervention, and the population's Internet usage status before and after intervention. The difference between the two measurements represents the increase or decrease in Internet usage.These two instruments may be used by agencies making decisions about resource disbursement to reduce the digital divide in a variety of populations.",International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,2006,64,10,984-997,"Fisher, Yael; Bendas-Jacob, Orit",Achva Academic College,Israel,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033243853,5,"[Cattell, Raymond B.]|[]|Multivariate Behavioral Research|1966|1|2|245-276|10.1207/s15327906mbr0102_10|pub.1025511185|8624;[Ricci, Andrea]|[]|Telematics and Informatics|2000|17|1-2|141-167|10.1016/s0736-5853(00)00002-2|pub.1031906557|39;[Peled, Alon; Rashty, David]|[ur.01154664545.47; ]|Journal of Educational Computing Research|1999|21|4|413-431|10.2190/nlr6-k355-laqy-u01d|pub.1039161410|32;[Te'eni, Dov; Young, Dennis R.]|[ur.012420314006.93; ]|Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|2003|32|3|397-414|10.1177/0899764003254900|pub.1041205486|30;[Hoffman, Donna L.; Novak, Thomas P.; Schlosser, Ann]|[; ; ]|Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|2006|5|3|0-0|10.1111/j.1083-6101.2000.tb00341.x|pub.1061923611|135;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|First Monday|2002|7|4||10.5210/fm.v7i4.942|pub.1072710742|980;[]|[]|Choice|2002|40|02|40-1165-40-1165|10.5860/choice.40-1165|pub.1073382743|884"

The term is also used to characterize the disparity between those who can effectively use information technology and those who cannot. This paper explores the digital divide within the United States (U.S.) and worldwide. Factors contributing to the widening of the gap are identified, including differences in income, age, education, race, household type, and geographic location. In an effort to reduce the Digital Divide, initiatives have been undertaken, such as promoting increased competition to reduce equipment and internet connection costs and U.S. government legislation to provide incentives such as tax relief to Internet providers serving specific geographic areas, and the global initiative by the G- 8 Heads of State to help coordinate worldwide government efforts in closing the Digital Divide.",InSITE Conference,2001,,,,"C.

The authors compare the effects of these various social national conditions on the pervasiveness of IT. Their preliminary results indicate that it is neither political nor economic national characteristics that are the determinants of IT connectedness but that cultural features are the prime causes.

pub.1015285876,10.1007/978-0-387-84822-8_10,Digital divides and the role of policy and regulation: a qualitative study,"This chapter aims to answer the research question: what is the role of internet policy and regulation in digital divides in Greece? I argue that Internet policy and regulation account significantly for the persistence of digital divides in Greece. The chapter draws on literature that views the role of policy and regulation in digital inclusion as problematic and proposes a more dialectical view of the interactions between politics and technology, so that the democratic and participatory potential of the Information Society can be approached more critically. The chapter explores the research question empirically through in-depth individual interviews with elite actors in the Greek Information Society. Elite actors who are involved in various areas of policy and regulation in the Greek Information Society are in the position to account for the role of internet policy and regulation in aspects of digital exclusion from more than one perspective. Thus, the chapter argues about the significant role of decision-making in the Greek case of digital divides, providing the grounding upon which research outside Greece could rely on to look at other cases of digital divides and at the role of policy and regulation accordingly.Keywords: Digital divides, Greece, policy, regulation, interviews",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2008,282,,141-160,"Tsatsou, Panayiota",London School of Economics and Political Science,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015285876,0,
pub.1072231747,10.4102/sajim.v13i1.471,Conquering the digital divide: Botswana and South Korea digital divide status and interventions,"Background: Botswana is putting in place initiatives towards establishing itself as a knowledgebased economy. Transformation from a resource-based to a knowledge-based economy is partly hinged on innovation, research and development capability, knowledge channels, and the funding of research and development activities.Objectives: Bridging the digital divide and narrowing the intra-national divide brings about global information and communication technology (ICT) usage that translates into changing work patterns and eventually transformed economies. This article outlines the different interventions implemented in Botswana to bridge the divide. The South Korean experience in bridging the divide is discussed so as to serve as lessons on how to effectively bridge the divide to Botswana’s initiatives.Method: Using a mix of exploratory and empirical study, this article presents the findings on the status of ICT uptake in Botswana and investigates the level of the digital divide in the country.Results: The results of the study show that the digital divide is much more evident in Botswana than in South Korea. South Korea has put in place robust strategic initiatives towards reducing the digital divide and this has largely transcended into its transformation into a full-fledged knowledge society.Conclusion: This article is timely as it unearths the different pointers that may be utilised in policy formation and what interventions need to be taken at both the individual and national level to bridge the digital divide.",South African Journal of Information Management,2011,13,1,,"Sedimo, Nonofo C.; Bwalya, Kelvin J.; Du Plessis, Tanya",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072231747,6,"[Chon, Kilnam]|[ur.012452337445.32]|Communications of the ACM|2001|44|3|116-117|10.1145/365181.365231|pub.1006146065|9;[Van der Meer, André; Van Winden, Willem]|[; ur.012610151647.28]|Regional Studies|2003|37|4|407-419|10.1080/0034340032000074433|pub.1014271777|67;[Lee, Heejin; O'Keefe, Robert M.; Yun, Kyounglim]|[ur.014447244057.64; ; ur.016042205057.28]|The Information Society|2003|19|1|81-93|10.1080/01972240309470|pub.1015362240|93;[Cullen, Rowena]|[ur.01027321712.95]|The Electronic Library|2003|21|3|247-257|10.1108/02640470310480506|pub.1016234847|46;[Venturelli, Shalini]|[ur.010662255675.53]|Telematics and Informatics|2002|19|2|69-90|10.1016/s0736-5853(01)00007-7|pub.1019243008|32;[CAMPBELL, Duncan]|[]|International Labour Review|2001|140|2|119-141|10.1111/j.1564-913x.2001.tb00217.x|pub.1025997139|61;[Luk, Sabrina Ching Yuen]|[ur.010607622263.14]|Government Information Quarterly|2009|26|4|594-604|10.1016/j.giq.2009.02.009|pub.1031723542|73;[Fuchs, Christian; Horak, Eva]|[ur.011011325200.42; ]|Telematics and Informatics|2008|25|2|99-116|10.1016/j.tele.2006.06.004|pub.1053315652|197;[Mansell, R.]|[ur.013665171232.89]|Oxford Review of Economic Policy|2001|17|2|282-295|10.1093/oxrep/17.2.282|pub.1059967054|74"

In order to participate in the consumption and creation of online media, citizens must have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate technology resources. There exists a gap between those who have access to technology and those who do not A gap commonly referred to as the digital divide. While there are many different aspects to the digital divide one of them is access to the software necessary to participate in digital media. A potential solution to the software component of the digital divide is the use of open source software and free online services.

Empirical studies of broadband subscription gaps have largely used cross-sectional data, which cannot speak to the timing of technological adoption. Yet, the dynamics of a digital divide are important and deserve study. With the goal of improving our understanding of appropriate techniques for analyzing digital divides, we review econometric methodology and propose the use of duration analysis. We compare the performance of alternative estimation methods using a large dataset on DSL subscription in the U.S., paying particular attention to whether women, blacks, and Hispanics catch up to others in the broadband adoption race. We conclude that duration analysis best captures the dynamics of the broadband gaps and is a useful addition to the analytic tool box of digital divide researchers. Our results support the official collection of broadband statistics in panel form, where the same households are followed over time.",Handbook of Research on Overcoming Digital Divides,2010,,,645-665,"Ferro, Enrico; Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Gil-Garcia, J.

pub.1012858785,10.1016/j.giq.2008.05.004,Understanding the complexity of electronic government: Implications from the digital divide literature,"Theoretically and practically E-Government and the digital divide are intertwined social phenomena. Using sophisticated information technologies (IT) in government has little social value if citizens are not able to use services or interact in political processes in meaningful ways. Similarly, understanding the development and use of IT in government without incorporating a demand perspective would potentially lead to partial explanations of a complex social reality. This article argues that studies about E-Government and the digital divide, which have been relatively disconnected research areas, have important parallels and potential intersections. These parallels may be useful in understanding E-Government projects and policies in a more comprehensive way and, consequently, for developing effective digital strategies. The paper reviews trajectories in E-Government and digital divide research and suggests potential implications drawn from the digital divide literature for E-Government research and practice, including model and theory development, understanding users, and some determinants of demand.",Government Information Quarterly,2009,26,1,89-97,"Helbig, Natalie; Gil-García, J.

A better understanding of the determinants of broadband access at the individual level represents a key starting point for any e-inclusion policy. Based on a review of the literature on digital divide and broadband access, we document different approaches to understanding the digital divide and argue that these perspectives can also help to understand broadband access. Combining the digital divide and broadband literature provides a systematic and theory-based approach to the selection and inclusion of variables in different models. This chapter presents the results of a survey conducted in an Italian region. We provide some implications of our findings and argue that policymakers should explore the relationship between IT skills acquisition, broadband access, and Internet use in order to develop more effective policies and programs.",Handbook of Research on Global Diffusion of Broadband Data Transmission,2008,,,160-176,"Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Papazafeiropoulou, Anastasia; Choudrie, Jyoti; Ferro, Enrico; Gil-Garcia, J.

Eleven variables providing data on 126 countries are analyzed using multivariate regression to identify which of them influence Internet usage to what extent. The used data on 126 countries refer to the year 2005. The results show that income inequality measured by the Gini coefficient is an important influencing factor besides per capita income, the degree of urbanization, and the level of democratization. The results question reductionistic digital divide approaches that analyze information inequality via focusing on a single variable (such as technology or markets). Access to ICTs is shaped by the interaction of socioeconomic, political, cultural, social, and technological factors. These results cast doubt on technological determinism, economic reductionism, and linear trend projection in the digital divide debate.

The usual conception of the digital divide as a bifurcation between the information ‘rich’ and ‘poor’ in fact does a poor job at describing the reality of the situation, which is characterized by multiple dimensions of digital divides in many contexts. Taking the lead from Albert Borgmann, it is recognized that the so-called information poor do possess a rich resource of information which needs to be fully accounted for in order to solve the global digital divide problem. In addition, making information transparent means, following the theory of development of Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto, that information should be made available and accessible through a system of representation. Floridi’s account of information ethics thus needs to be supplemented by the realization that members of infosphere, which in his view consist of information objects, should be made transparent in order that the global digital divide be ameliorated. In other words there should be a system of information about information, namely semantic representation of objective information which enables the locals to make full use of their available informational resources.",Minds and Machines,2004,14,1,85-99,"Hongladarom, Soraj",Chulalongkorn University,Thailand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015113631,10,"[Floridi, Luciano]|[ur.015031603611.12]|Ethics and Information Technology|1999|1|1|33-52|10.1023/a:1010018611096|pub.1009300700|232;[Floridi, Luciano]|[ur.015031603611.12]|Metaphilosophy|2002|33|1‐2|123-145|10.1111/1467-9973.00221|pub.1015072051|124;[Floridi, Luciano; Sanders, J.W.]|[ur.015031603611.12; ]|Ethics and Information Technology|2002|4|1|1-9|10.1023/a:1015209807065|pub.1016440283|57;[Floridi, Luciano]|[ur.015031603611.12]|Ethics and Information Technology|2002|4|4|287-304|10.1023/a:1021342422699|pub.1037776593|132;[Moss, Jeremy]|[]|Ethics and Information Technology|2002|4|2|159-165|10.1023/a:1019983909305|pub.1037967441|28;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|First Monday|2002|7|4||10.5210/fm.v7i4.942|pub.1072710742|980;[Floridi, Luciano]|[ur.015031603611.12]|Philosophy in the Contemporary World|2002|9|1|39-45|10.5840/pcw2002915|pub.1073224210|40;[Floridi, Luciano]|[]|The Philosophers Magazine|2001||16|18-19|10.5840/tpm20011647|pub.1073266238|14"
pub.1039002537,10.1080/1097198x.2005.10856401,A Conceptual Framework for the Role of Government in Bridging the Digital Divide,"In the current era of technological growth and innovation, the role of information and communication technology (ICT) as a catalyst to enhance economic development and the quality of life in developing countries, has become an increasingly important issue. The term digital divide has been used to refer to the gap between those who have access to and utilize ICT versus those who do not. Based on the literature on the digital divide and calls for broad-spectrum interdisciplinary frameworks to guide research on this topic (Lu, 2001), a conceptual framework is presented in this paper to explain the forces that often increase the digital divide as well as those that can provide the means to bridge it. Using this framework, India is used as an illustrative case to document attempts to utilize ICT to enhance the economic circumstances and quality of life for the rural and poor segments of the Indian population and to argue that government and other public institutions have an important role in bridging the digital divide in developing countries. Further, the direct role of government is distinguished from the indirect role in order to clarify and delineate the various ways in which public institutions can facilitate bridging the digital divide.",Journal of Global Information Technology Management,2005,8,3,28-46,"Mistry, Jamshed J.",Worcester Polytechnic Institute,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039002537,18,"[Lu, Ming-te]|[ur.015276504143.90]|Journal of Global Information Technology Management|2001|4|3|1-4|10.1080/1097198x.2001.10856304|pub.1012019015|44;[Bateman, Milford]|[ur.015427664346.16]|Small Business Economics|2000|14|4|275-298|10.1023/a:1008170805013|pub.1016644878|54;[Marangos, John]|[ur.013540176363.76]|Journal of International Development|2002|14|5|573-589|10.1002/jid.909|pub.1019207111|21;[Kaushik, Surendra K.]|[ur.07474065125.54]|American Journal of Economics and Sociology|2010|56|1|69-84|10.1111/j.1536-7150.1997.tb03452.x|pub.1019651167|17;[James, J.]|[ur.07532230071.92]|Futures|2003|35|5|461-472|10.1016/s0016-3287(02)00092-7|pub.1031846519|26;[Davison, Robert; Harris, Roger; Vogel, Doug; de Vreede, Gert Jan]|[ur.015315076147.37; ; ur.016344630467.67; ur.011536255313.17]|Journal of Global Information Technology Management|1999|2|3|1-4|10.1080/1097198x.1999.10856255|pub.1036718468|3;[Palvia, Prashant C; Palvia, Shailendra C Jain; Whitworth, James Edward]|[ur.010366556753.27; ur.013376747015.60; ur.016516144503.82]|Information & Management|2002|39|5|403-414|10.1016/s0378-7206(01)00106-9|pub.1048006407|55;[Sharma, Sushil K.; Gupta, Jatinder N.D.]|[ur.013744356242.19; ur.014570173447.25]|Journal of Global Information Technology Management|2003|6|3|3-21|10.1080/1097198x.2003.10856353|pub.1049911686|20;[Matsuyama, Kiminori]|[]|Journal of Political Economy|2002|110|5|1035-1070|10.1086/341873|pub.1058639175|148;[Mansell, R.]|[ur.013665171232.89]|Oxford Review of Economic Policy|2001|17|2|282-295|10.1093/oxrep/17.2.282|pub.1059967054|74;[RIGGINS, FREDERICK J.]|[ur.013255447741.01]|Journal of Management Information Systems|2004|21|2|161-179|10.1080/07421222.2004.11045807|pub.1085538068|18;[Compaine, Benjamin M.]|[]|The Digital Divide|2001||||10.7551/mitpress/2419.001.0001|pub.1110922707|242"

pub.1039281789,10.1016/j.giq.2010.05.007,The role of IT literacy in defining digital divide policy needs,"This article expands our current understanding of the digital divide by examining differences in individuals' IT skills acquisition. In the last two decades scholars have gradually refined the conceptualization of the digital divide, moving from a dichotomous model mainly based on access, to a multidimensional model accounting for differences in usage levels and actors' perspectives. Digital divide views tend to focus on groups of users and user characteristics and focus less on different processes of use. As models of the digital divide became more complex, research focused on deepening the understanding of demographic and socioeconomic differences between adopters and non-adopters. While IT literacy is an important factor in digital divide research, and studies examine user characteristics with respect to IT literacy, few studies make the process of basic IT literacy acquisition their main focal point (Selwyn, 2005). This perspective furthers our thinking by expanding the notion of user characteristics beyond demographic and socioeconomic differences to differences in the processes leading to internet use. Based on a dataset referring to an Italian region, this paper presents a metaphorical interpretation of the digital divide in general and explores the process of IT skills acquisition in particular. Our analysis shows the key role of self-learning and the presence of three distinct approaches in IT skills acquisition leading to different needs in terms of policy. We argue that these preliminary results are a useful starting point for the design of more effective and sophisticated digital inclusion policies.",Government Information Quarterly,2011,28,1,3-10,"Ferro, Enrico; Helbig, Natalie C.; Gil-Garcia, J.

For instance, senior citizens, citizens without employment, or citizens with low education utilise online services in a distinct way, often to a lesser extent. Within this paper, we examine how such digital divide groups make use of different online services. Here, four types on services are taken into account and contrasted with each other: Internet usage, E-Commerce usage, E-Government for Information and E-Government for Transaction. As a result, we develop the E-Inclusion-Gap Model which addresses gaps between such service-specific usage and we discuss possible reasons behind them.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2008,5184,,231-242,"Becker, Jörg; Niehaves, Björn; Bergener, Philipp; Räckers, Michael",University of Münster,Germany,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1000434997,29,"[Grönlund, Åke; Hatakka, Mathias; Ask, Andreas]|[ur.0744362523.41; ur.013642060151.00; ur.016016306103.19]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2007|4656||216-227|10.1007/978-3-540-74444-3_19|pub.1012036169|18;[Ferro, Enrico; Gil-Garcia, J.

Barriers to accessing the Internet and computers have been widely targeted by myriad initiatives, but efforts aimed at bridging this first-level “digital divide” have not led to increased use of the Internet and digital library resources in U.S. classrooms. In fact, such programs have revealed additional divides that affect educators’ use.

pub.1032340709,10.4018/jide.2010070101,Next Generation Networks: A New Digital Divide?,"At present there is no one definition of the term ‘International Digital Divide’. It is often defined in different ways, but nevertheless, factors that influence its definition include access to telecommunication lines, the ratio of internet hosts to GDP, and the level of development of the human capital base. The lack of a clear definition will have knock-on effects in the loan documentation of aid agencies involved in infrastructure development and capacity building. However, a clear definition of the divide could help to focus and better target the necessary investment to help address the inequalities the divide attempts to capture, particularly with the rollout of NGNs. This paper attempts to (a) provide a brief overview on the rise and structure of the internet and evolution to Next Generation Networks, (b) set out basic indicators of the Digital Divide and clarify the significance of these linkages, and (c) to review various definitions of the Digital Divide available in current literature so as to arrive at one new overriding definition.",International Journal of Innovation in the Digital Economy,2010,1,3,1-21,"Kariyawasam, Rohan",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032340709,3,"[Quibria, M.G; Ahmed, Shamsun N; Tschang, Ted; Reyes-Macasaquit, Mari-Len]|[ur.015764721413.10; ur.010654611213.10; ur.012247552213.80; ur.015235454213.44]|Journal of Asian Economics|2003|13|6|811-825|10.1016/s1049-0078(02)00186-0|pub.1000815131|147;[Kiiski, Sampsa; Pohjola, Matti]|[ur.012603406201.20; ur.013107663011.00]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|297-310|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00071-3|pub.1001159834|314;[Dasgupta, Susmita; Lall, Somik; Wheeler, David]|[ur.07725533447.34; ur.016411736217.36; ]|Oxford Development Studies|2005|33|2|229-243|10.1080/13600810500137889|pub.1002252553|85;[Wong, Poh-Kam]|[ur.015333364767.86]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|167-187|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00065-8|pub.1002363516|85;[]|[]|International Economic Law and the Digital Divide|2007||||10.4337/9781847205452|pub.1003738529|12;[Beilock, Richard; Dimitrova, Daniela V]|[ur.014323447013.67; ur.014237167607.22]|Telecommunications Policy|2003|27|3-4|237-252|10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00100-3|pub.1010780120|140;[Chinn, M.

pub.1038905116,10.1108/02640470810864118,Bridging the digital divide,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to show how the digital divide has become a common metaphor originating from now nearly obsolete phrases such as “information have and have nots” and “information rich and information poor”. The article aims to focus on several dimensions of the digital divide that pertain to service as well as the responsibilities of libraries.   Design/methodology/approach This article places emphasis on the role of librarians and information professionals in bridging the digital divide by indicating some aspects related to it as evidenced in the literature including its definition, aspects, factors affecting, and internet users.   Findings Libraries are treated as one of the major social tools which can solve the information divide rooted in the digital divide and contribute to the realization of democratic society.   Research limitations/implications This article revolves around the authors' points of view. So, further studies, especially comparative research between developed and developing countries which vary in terms of digital divide rate, can help to understand the real role librarians and information professionals play.   Practical implications Rethinking the digital divide, librarians must redesign and redefine their service menu for their customers through thinking functionally.

pub.1072709311,10.5210/fm.v11i3.1318,Digital divide or digital development?: The Internet in Mexico,"This paper discusses the development of the Internet in Mexico within the context of the digital divide. There is skepticism about whether the digital divide is something driven primarily by technology rather than an epiphenomenon driven by socioeconomic factors. The barriers to access are not technological but rather economic and historical. Although Mexico shows wide disparities in Internet access, it also shows rapid development toward more access. The number of regular Internet users in Mexico is small (about 14 million) but has shown consistent growth. Business and non–governmental organization presence on the Web is increasing, and the Mexican government is innovatively using the Web to broaden contact with its citizens. In the Mexican case, there is certainly evidence of a digital divide. Nevertheless, there is also ample evidence of digital development.",First Monday,2006,,,,"Curry, James; Kenney, Martin",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072709311,13,
pub.1016715647,10.1007/0-387-34588-4_16,Responsible Management of Digital Divides: An Oxymoronic Endeavor?,"This paper critiques the notion of responsible management of information systems by pointing out the intrinsic contradiction inherent in the idea of managing morality and ethics in information systems. The paper, being part of the tradition of critical research in IS, uses the example of managing digital divides to argue that a traditional view of management (here called heroic management) leads to conceptual problems. It will develop two basic arguments that undermine the possibility of responsible heroic management of digital divides: (1) Normative issues related to digital divides cannot be managed because management is part of the construction of the problem and therefore lacks the detached and objective viewpoint required for rational management. (2) The very concept of responsibility, if taken seriously and applied responsibly (here called reflective responsibility) requires a participative approach that contradicts the traditional top-down approach of heroic management. The paper will conclude with a discussion of what form management of IS needs to take if it wants to be responsible.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2006,208,,231-243,"Stahl, Bernd Carsten",De Montfort University,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016715647,0,"[Kvasny, Lynette; Keil, Mark]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.013136272710.25]|Information Systems Journal|2006|16|1|23-53|10.1111/j.1365-2575.2006.00207.x|pub.1000107294|158;[Stahl, Bernd Carsten]|[ur.015337552312.43]|European Journal of Information Systems|2005|14|5|487-491|10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000560|pub.1000713386|9;[Wilson, F.A.]|[ur.011547164741.51]|Information Technology and People|1997|10|3|187-204|10.1108/09593849710178207|pub.1000996170|29;[Couldry, Nick]|[]|Ethics and Information Technology|2003|5|2|89-97|10.1023/a:1024916618904|pub.1007671680|27;[McGrath, Kathy]|[ur.016463703606.03]|Information Systems Journal|2005|15|2|85-101|10.1111/j.1365-2575.2005.00187.x|pub.1008991102|65;[Joia, Luiz Antonio; Bourlakis, Constatine A.; Bourlakis, Michael A.]|[; ; ur.016623674573.47]|IT-Based Management|2003|||257-276|10.4018/978-1-59140-033-2.ch015|pub.1013431726|3;[Goldman, Alvin I.]|[]|Responsibility|1999|||201-217|10.1017/cbo9780511524103.008|pub.1021392731|1;[Knights, David; Morgan, Glenn]|[ur.016101355257.07; ur.013120663717.72]|Organization Studies|1991|12|2|251-273|10.1177/017084069101200205|pub.1027242638|672;[Kvasny, Lynette; Truex, Duane]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.013072777061.80]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2000|41||277-293|10.1007/978-0-387-35505-4_17|pub.1029343048|21;[Introna, Lucas D.]|[ur.014523651252.94]|Information Systems Series|1997||||10.1007/978-1-349-14549-2|pub.1032711998|150;[Moss, Jeremy]|[]|Ethics and Information Technology|2002|4|2|159-165|10.1023/a:1019983909305|pub.1037967441|28;[Parayil, Govindan]|[ur.015445147512.04]|The Information Society|2005|21|1|41-51|10.1080/01972240590895900|pub.1044826487|71;[Hacker, Kenneth L.; Mason, Shana M.]|[; ]|Ethics and Information Technology|2003|5|2|99-115|10.1023/a:1024968602974|pub.1046772669|28;[McSorley, Kevin]|[]|Ethics and Information Technology|2003|5|2|75-87|10.1023/a:1024946302065|pub.1047728390|5;[Varey, Richard J.; Wood-Harper, Trevor; Wood, Bob]|[ur.010131636717.88; ur.012355330361.72; ur.014640563477.91]|Journal of Information Technology|2002|17|4|229-239|10.1080/0268396022000017725|pub.1058311989|24;[Mcaulay, Laurie; Doherty, Neil; Keval, Natasha]|[ur.010705772471.95; ur.0756366500.80; ]|Journal of Information Technology|2002|17|4|241-255|10.1080/0268396022000017734|pub.1058311990|25;[Fischer, John Martin]|[]|Ethics|1999|110|1|93-139|10.1086/233206|pub.1058552071|277;[Adam, A.]|[ur.014361323573.45]|IEEE Technology and Society Magazine|2001|20|3|39-46|10.1109/44.952764|pub.1061174714|10;[Fineman, Stephen]|[ur.016433252127.68]|Organization|2001|8|1|17-31|10.1177/135050840181002|pub.1063986663|55;[Newell, Sue; Swan, Jacky; Kautz, Karlheinz]|[ur.010643725351.91; ur.014427207751.43; ur.010777777537.75]|Organization|2001|8|1|97-120|10.1177/135050840181006|pub.1063986667|31;[Lawler, John]|[]|International Journal of Management Concepts and Philosophy|2004|1|1|61|10.1504/ijmcp.2004.004843|pub.1067471896|4;[Alvesson, Mats; Willmott, Hugh]|[ur.014743500027.52; ur.015537060261.58]|Academy of Management Review|1992|17|3|432|10.2307/258718|pub.1070010328|72;[Donaldson, Thomas; Preston, Lee E.]|[; ]|Academy of Management Review|1995|20|1|65|10.2307/258887|pub.1070010438|1451;[Gosling, Jonathan; Mintzberg, Henry]|[ur.01177524540.00; ur.01202705110.47]|Harvard Business Review|2003|81|11|54-63, 137||pub.1076597283|182;[Levy, David L.; Alvesson, Mats; Willmott, Hugh]|[; ur.014743500027.52; ur.015537060261.58]|Studying Management Critically|2003|||92-110|10.4135/9781446220030.n5|pub.1088010779|71;[Alvesson, Mats; Deetz, Stanley]|[ur.014743500027.52; ur.011177073471.13]||2000||||10.4135/9781849208918|pub.1095899280|953;[]|[]||2001||||10.4018/978-1-93070-806-8|pub.1096030018|259;[Stahl, Bernd Carsten]|[ur.015337552312.43]||2004||||10.4018/978-1-59140-172-8|pub.1096031184|22;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]||2001||||10.1017/cbo9781139164887|pub.1098663486|2054;[Riggins, Frederick; Dewan, Sanjeev]|[; ]|Journal of the Association for Information Systems|2005|6|12|298-337|10.17705/1jais.00074|pub.1100731533|295;[Hirschheim, Rudy; Klein, Heinz K.]|[ur.07550242121.68; ur.012120760240.46]|MIS Quarterly|1994|18|1|83|10.2307/249611|pub.1102515051|194;[Klein, Heinz K.; Myers, Michael D.]|[; ]|MIS Quarterly|1999|23|1|67|10.2307/249410|pub.1102515063|2232;[Ngwenyama, Ojelanki K.; Lee, Allen S.]|[ur.014410037451.18; ur.015734003331.26]|MIS Quarterly|1997|21|2|145|10.2307/249417|pub.1102515102|385;[]|[]|Digital Capitalism|1999||||10.7551/mitpress/2415.001.0001|pub.1110617300|397"

There is skepticism about whether the digital divide is something driven primarily by technology rather than an epiphenomenon driven by socioeconomic factors. The barriers to access are not technological but rather economic and historical. Although Mexico shows wide disparities in Internet access, it also shows rapid development toward more access. The number of regular Internet users in Mexico is small (about 14 million) but has shown consistent growth. Business and non–governmental organization presence on the Web is increasing, and the Mexican government is innovatively using the Web to broaden contact with its citizens. In the Mexican case, there is certainly evidence of a digital divide.

This paper challenges both assumptions. First, looking at various measures of the digital divide, there is a divide in per‐capita access to ICTs but developing countries show faster rates of growth in network development than developed countries. Moreover, when employing a per‐income measure of access, developing countries already “digitally leapfrog” the developed world. Second, the paper examines the prediction that disparities in absolute access to ICTs between countries will lead to reduced development prospects in poor countries. Past experience has shown that it is very difficult to make predictions of this type. The paper concludes that we may be posing the wrong policy questions when focusing on a “digital divide” as it is commonly understood.",Info,2003,5,6,15-24,"Fink, Carsten; Kenny, Charles J.",World Bank,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049974927,81,"[Venables, Anthony J.]|[ur.01314754670.49]|Journal of Industry, Competition and Trade|2001|1|2|135-159|10.1023/a:1012830529827|pub.1003943585|79;[Kenny, Charles]|[]|Oxford Development Studies|2003|31|1|99-113|10.1080/1360081032000047212|pub.1007736639|66;[Leamer, Edward E.; Storper, Michael]|[ur.016045311562.71; ur.011644520437.88]|Journal of International Business Studies|2001|32|4|641-665|10.1057/palgrave.jibs.84909988|pub.1010343490|456;[Kolko, Jed]|[ur.014355713036.84]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|211-232|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00067-1|pub.1041901600|48;[Forestier, Emmanuel; Grace, Jeremy; Kenny, Charles]|[; ur.07740001375.80; ur.010254167455.56]|Telecommunications Policy|2002|26|11|623-646|10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00061-7|pub.1050411674|78;[Kenny, Charles]|[]|Info|2002|4|3||10.1108/info.2002.27204cab.001|pub.1061051123|3;[Freund, Caroline; Weinhold, Diana]|[ur.010623316205.08; ur.010167421435.52]|American Economic Review|2002|92|2|236-240|10.1257/000282802320189320|pub.1064523858|260;[Pritchett, Lant]|[ur.07401650667.86]|Journal of Economic Perspectives|1997|11|3|3-17|10.1257/jep.11.3.3|pub.1064529858|702;[Warschauer, Mark]|[]|First Monday|2002|7|7||10.5210/fm.v7i7.967|pub.1072710766|277;[Fink, Carsten; Mattoo, Aaditya; Rathindran, Randeep]|[ur.014324654347.78; ur.012674551767.03; ur.01314631625.26]|Policy Research Working Papers|2002||||10.1596/1813-9450-2909|pub.1109731826|50;[Fink, Carsten; Mattoo, Aaditya; Neagu, Ileana]|[ur.014324654347.78; ur.012674551767.03; ur.010664100473.36]|Policy Research Working Papers|2002||||10.1596/1813-9450-2929|pub.1109731846|24;[Freund, Caroline L.; Weinhold, Diana]|[ur.010623316205.08; ur.010167421435.52]|International Finance Discussion Paper|2000|2000|693|1-43|10.17016/ifdp.2000.693|pub.1120172029|18"

Beyond this, the second goal is to find out if a digital divide has a significant association with the process of becoming an EU member. First, member, new member, and candidate countries are classified into three groups, and MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance) is applied to determine differences among these groups in terms of Information Society levels. Then, Information Society variables are analyzed using Discriminant Analysis. According to the results of the research, there is a significant level of digital divide in the EU and a certain information society level currently is not associated with EU membership. The EU must address the digital divide among member countries if they are to become a close-knit community, and to continue to be one of the most competitive economic powers in the world.

pub.1013295631,10.1108/02640470610689179,Addressing the digital divide in teaching information retrieval,"Purpose The purpose of this article is to help students to move from ICT access to knowledge sharing.   Design/methodology/approach An overview of the literature on information literacy skills and the digital divide, an analysis of information seeking research, as well as experience in teaching a course in advanced information retrieval at the Department of Information Science, University of Pretoria, South Africa, inspired a theoretical model for addressing different layers of the digital divide.   Findings The digital divide concerns more than just ICT access and information skills. Individual commitment, group work, and intellectual and academic support from the institution might contribute to bringing people to higher levels of knowledge generation and communication.

In order to ensure the achievement of bridging digital divides, governments need to be aware of their absence and weakness in strategy formulation and implementation in addition to simply launching projects towards strategic visions and objectives. However, the literature shows little help for the governments to detect the shortcomings of their strategies and to identity gaps between strategic objectives and performance measures. The goal of this research is to propose generic strategic gaps models based on the balanced scorecard framework for identifying and analyzing the strategic gap situations. Both horizontal and vertical strategic gaps regarding project efforts for reducing digital divides will be determined and discussed. The proposed approach and analysis models are then applied to the case of Taiwan for demonstrating their feasibility and usefulness.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2006,226,,405-418,"Yu, Chien-Chih; Wang, Hsing-I",National Chengchi University,Taiwan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1008660144,1,"[Yu, Chien-Chih; Wang, Hsing-I]|[ur.014676551131.71; ur.07504154434.16]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2005|3591||151-162|10.1007/11545156_15|pub.1000354437|5;[Ahn, Heinz]|[]|Long Range Planning|2001|34|4|441-461|10.1016/s0024-6301(01)00057-7|pub.1020104242|207;[Chan, Yee‐Ching Lilian]|[ur.016012367043.41]|International Journal of Public Sector Management|2004|17|3|204-221|10.1108/09513550410530144|pub.1023565565|108;[Epstein, Marc; Manzoni, Jean-François]|[ur.010471520302.41; ur.01024023401.02]|European Management Journal|1998|16|2|190-203|10.1016/s0263-2373(97)00087-x|pub.1026722750|172;[Jalava, Jukka; Pohjola, Matti]|[ur.012713076467.26; ur.013107663011.00]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|189-210|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00066-x|pub.1026761325|140;[Vining, Aidan; Meredith, Lindsay]|[ur.015470763741.23; ur.011647111107.49]|European Management Journal|2000|18|6|605-618|10.1016/s0263-2373(00)00053-0|pub.1027121890|5;[Bertot, John Carlo]|[ur.011253735727.32]|Government Information Quarterly|2003|20|2|185-191|10.1016/s0740-624x(03)00036-4|pub.1027199920|96;[Griffiths, John]|[]|Australian Journal of Public Administration|2003|62|4|70-79|10.1111/j..2003.00350.x|pub.1030794848|36;[Yu, Chien-Chih; Wang, Hsing-I]|[ur.014676551131.71; ur.07504154434.16]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2004|3183||293-299|10.1007/978-3-540-30078-6_49|pub.1043729182|4;[Bates, Donald L.; Dillard, John E.]|[; ]|Journal of General Management|1992|18|1|51-62|10.1177/030630709201800104|pub.1084243758|3;[Harrison, E.

Design/methodology/approach This study examines the continuing problem of digital divide in the United States based on data collected from several national and organizational reports along with our own survey.   Findings The findings show that the problem of digital divide, which is specifically affected by various demographic factors, still exists despite the rapid uptake of new technologies, which is occurring among a majority of groups of Americans in the United States.

The aim of this paper is to briefly review the extent to which cloud computing applications and services currently used by secondary education systems in developed countries around the world can be used to help breach the digital divide that currently exists in the secondary (basic) education sector in South Africa. The authors believe that South Africa has the required technology and skills to bridge the digital divide in secondary education and by doing so set the pace for the rest of the African continent. All it lacks is the political will and determination to do so.",Information Development,2011,27,2,109-116,"Le Roux, C.J.B.; Evans, N.",University of Zululand,South Africa,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038004304,20,
pub.1002262470,10.1111/1467-8411.00103,The Digital Divide in East Asia,"The concept of a ‘digital divide’—inequality in access to modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) between industrialised and developing countries, and between urban and rural populations—has attracted much attention from policymakers, aid organisations, media and the general public. This paper places discussion of the digital divide in a broader economic context, linking it with the theory of economic growth and technological change. The network effects of diffusion of the Internet are related to the possibility of leap‐frogging by latecomers. This is seen as a ‘digital opportunity’ presented to developing countries by the ‘new economy’. This paper discusses the appropriate policy environment for bridging the digital divide, and concludes that the East Asian region has much to gain from the complementarities of its economies, their openness to trade in ICT products, and policy cooperation.",Asian-Pacific Economic Literature,2001,15,2,18-30,"Sidorenko, Alexandra; Findlay, Christopher",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002262470,13,"[Shy, Oz]|[ur.015773075021.43]|International Journal of Industrial Organization|1996|14|6|785-800|10.1016/0167-7187(96)01011-9|pub.1019854344|73;[Economides, Nicholas]|[ur.012112425417.80]|International Journal of Industrial Organization|1996|14|6|673-699|10.1016/0167-7187(96)01015-6|pub.1025098934|851;[Dudley, Leonard]|[ur.015356705061.09]|European Economic Review|1999|43|3|595-619|10.1016/s0014-2921(97)00129-3|pub.1030240084|29;[Jorgenson, Dale Weldeau; Stiroh, Kevin J.]|[ur.012327275705.42; ur.012362462064.30]|Brookings Papers on Economic Activity|2000|2000|1|125-210|10.1353/eca.2000.0008|pub.1031925788|771;[Hobday, Mike]|[ur.012115134441.32]|Asian-Pacific Economic Literature|2001|15|1|13-29|10.1111/1467-8411.00092|pub.1032012003|60;[Phillips, Ronnie J.]|[]|Journal of Economic Issues|2000|34|2|267-289|10.1080/00213624.2000.11506266|pub.1043914387|13;[Ben-Porath, Yoram]|[ur.014041635641.81]|Journal of Political Economy|1967|75|4, Part 1|352-365|10.1086/259291|pub.1058572772|1265;[Card, David; Krueger, Alan B.]|[ur.01020200442.77; ur.0655705467.19]|Journal of Political Economy|1992|100|1|1-40|10.1086/261805|pub.1058575286|827;[Hanushek, Eric A; Kimko, Dennis D]|[ur.014257312001.03; ]|American Economic Review|2000|90|5|1184-1208|10.1257/aer.90.5.1184|pub.1064527140|979;[Baily, Martin Neil; Lawrence, Robert Z]|[ur.07471216453.51; ur.014132250442.35]|American Economic Review|2001|91|2|308-312|10.1257/aer.91.2.308|pub.1064527225|97;[Caselli, Francesco; Coleman, Wilbur John]|[ur.0707661350.95; ur.016237233756.43]|American Economic Review|2001|91|2|328-335|10.1257/aer.91.2.328|pub.1064527229|343;[Oliner, Stephen D; Sichel, Daniel E]|[ur.012303224745.40; ur.012566361004.04]|Journal of Economic Perspectives|2000|14|4|3-22|10.1257/jep.14.4.3|pub.1064530097|782;[Gordon, Robert J]|[]|Journal of Economic Perspectives|2000|14|4|49-74|10.1257/jep.14.4.49|pub.1064530098|613;[Liebowitz, S.

The results of the survey, from a technological scope, show the width of the technologic gap that separates those communities. Being aware of this digital divide, this research shows the results of the implementation of a strategy that allows deprived citizens, who live in the border zones, to reach information technology knowledge.

The global digital divide is a term often used to describe the gap between more and less economically developed nations, while at the national level, there is often an urban‐rural divide. In developing countries, most Internet users gain access through public access points like Internet cafés. In this article, we take a closer look at the digital divide within Tanzania. Based on a survey among Internet café users in rural, semi‐urban and central regions of the country, we find that the divide is mainly a question of finding venues with technology to access the Internet.

The Task Force outlined nine initiatives and a set of concrete action plans for implementation, which may achieve e-government readiness in developing countries. Major cultural variables, however, threaten to impede or thwart the facilitation of e-government even though many countries promote e-government policies. To examine the G-8's first effort to implement collaborative policy initiatives of the private, public, and non-profit sectors to eliminate the global digital divide, this paper will explore the relationship between six cultural variables and the implementation of the Digital Initiative to alleviate the digital divide and effect e-government readiness in developing countries.",Proceedings of the 35th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,2002,,,10-19,"Brown, Cheryl L.",University of North Carolina at Charlotte,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093299697,7,"[Hwang, Sung-Don; Choi, Younghoon; Myeong, Seung-Hwan]|[; ur.012150746433.37; ur.012242206315.40]|Government Information Quarterly|1999|16|3|277-285|10.1016/s0740-624x(99)80028-8|pub.1028328868|26;[Milward, H.

The global digital divide is defined as the difference in the value of IT index (comprised of four IT adoption data: the Internet, PC, Cell phone and telephone) of a nation from the U.S. A model is proposed that contains several new indicators, not tried in the literature before. The model is then tested on Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) over a period of time. Results indicate that some of these indicators explain the existence of global digital divide. The study also concludes that the factors that are responsible for such divide are not all common for OECD and ECLAC set of nations and that significances of these indicators also vary over time.",Journal of Global Information Technology Management,2005,8,3,47-65,"Bagchi, Kallol",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052596901,76,"[Kiiski, Sampsa; Pohjola, Matti]|[ur.012603406201.20; ur.013107663011.00]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|297-310|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00071-3|pub.1001159834|314;[Katz, James; Aspden, Philip]|[ur.011125014303.05; ur.011004276717.53]|Internet Research|1997|7|3|170-188|10.1108/10662249710171814|pub.1002872177|179;[Kolence, Kenneth W.; Kiviat, Philip J.]|[ur.012430172666.09; ]|ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review|1973|2|3|2-12|10.1145/1041613.1041614|pub.1013238735|61;[Petrazzini, Ben; Kibati, Mugo]|[ur.07370173437.29; ur.012677502632.69]|Communications of the ACM|1999|42|6|31-36|10.1145/303849.303858|pub.1014877808|63;[Zak, Paul J.; Knack, Stephen]|[ur.0673026356.16; ur.011035012410.06]|The Economic Journal|2001|111|470|295-321|10.1111/1468-0297.00609|pub.1015592543|1580;[DiMaggio, Paul; Hargittai, Eszter; Neuman, W.

The E-Rate program aims to bridge the digital divide in advanced telecommunications by offering services to eligible schools and libraries for educational purposes at discounted rates. Currently in its sixth cycle, the E-Rate program has provided nearly US$13 billion in discounts to eligible organizations. The program has inspired much controversy and criticism, yet studies provide evidence that the program is effectively helping to enhance the provision of services to traditionally disadvantaged communities. This study challenges these claims and presents empirical evidence that suggests E-Rate resources are not systematically allocated to underprivileged, rural states where funds would most effectively help to bridge the digital gap in access to telecommunications technologies.",Social Science Computer Review,2005,23,4,502-506,"Panagopoulos, Costas",Yale University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063872579,6,

pub.1017910211,10.1108/13287260710817683,Evaluating a digital divide index in a regional context,"Purpose The purpose of this research is to show that the provision of an increasing range of remote, electronic access channels by private and public sector bodies is predicated on a critical mass of citizenry utilising such access channels. However, a major concern is that the increasing use of ICT for private and public sector transactions is seen as potentially creating a “digital divide” between those with access to technology and those who do not. This paper adapts an index of the digital divide documented in previous work and utilises this instrument to analyse the depth and breadth of this phenomenon in a UK region – Wales.   Design/methodology/approach The paper discusses the construction of a “digital divide index” (DDIX) for Wales based upon the previous established work of Husing and Selhofer. The DDIX is applied to data collected as part of a major European‐wide project – UNDERSTAND.   Findings The DDIX situates four citizen segments in terms of internet access and usage – gender, age, education and income. There are no significant digital divides evident within the Welsh region in terms of gender and income. However, there are significant digital divides in terms of age and education.   Research limitations/implications The DDIX as formulated considers a limited range of possible dimensions, both in terms of citizen groups and internet access and usage. Other possible dimensions for consideration are discussed in the paper.   Practical implications Our application of a DDIX has been useful in highlighting the multi‐faceted nature of this phenomenon within a regional context. Further research is required both to refine such an important information society metric and to apply it in further domains of analysis.   Originality/value The paper will be of interest both to academic researchers and policy‐makers interested in understanding and measuring the digital divide.",Journal of Systems and Information Technology,2007,9,1,46-59,"Beynon‐Davies, Paul; Hill, Rebecca",Cardiff University; Swansea University,United Kingdom; United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1017910211,11,"[Kottak, Conrad Phillip]|[ur.01051625102.26]|Social Science Computer Review|1996|14|1|10-15|10.1177/089443939601400103|pub.1012222403|6;[Beck, Eevi; Madon, Shirin; Sahay, Sundeep]|[; ur.011405200023.39; ur.012234426741.58]|The Information Society|2004|20|4|279-290|10.1080/01972240490481009|pub.1014337209|19;[SELWYN, NEIL; GORARD, STEPHEN; FURLONG, JOHN; MADDEN, LOUISE]|[ur.010274414500.72; ur.013540425157.90; ur.015440007171.58; ur.015432003705.59]|Ageing and Society|2003|23|5|561-582|10.1017/s0144686x03001302|pub.1054868004|404;[Liff, Sonia; Shepherd, Adrian; Wajcman, Judy; Rice, Ronald; Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.015432352362.07; ; ur.015341463255.56; ; ur.014036273417.00]|SSRN Electronic Journal|2004||||10.2139/ssrn.1308492|pub.1102258232|52;[Olphert, C.

pub.1002033085,10.1007/11823100_13,Is It Only About Internet Access? An Empirical Test of a Multi-dimensional Digital Divide,"Scholars from different disciplines have recently studied a phenomenon called “the digital divide”. Since many of the new government information technology initiatives are based on Internet technologies and require the use of the Internet by citizens, understanding the digital divide (and consequently, the potential demand) is important for e-government scholars. For some researchers, the divide is not a problem and Internet access is the only relevant determinant of Internet use (access divide). For other researchers, the divide is rooted in more fundamental social differences and opportunities (multi-dimensional divide). Using data from the Piedmont region in Italy, this paper tests these two competing views of the digital divide. Overall, the models based on a multi-dimensional view have greater explanatory power and provide evidence about the relevance of multiple factors affecting both Internet access and Internet use. For instance, females use the Internet for a smaller number of activities than males. Individuals with more formal education and who can speak English use the Internet more. Finally, individuals with more experience using a PC and the Internet itself also use the Internet to perform a broader range of activities.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2006,4084,,139-149,"Gil-Garcia, J.

pub.1011561322,10.1016/j.respol.2009.11.003,What really matters: Regional versus individual determinants of the digital divide in Germany,"This paper analyses the regional dimension of the German digital divide. It studies the determinants of home Internet use in Germany on the level of counties as well as on the level of individuals. Based on two large data sets, the analyses show that population density itself cannot explain regional differences in Internet use rates. The results rather indicate that it is the different composition of individual characteristics between rural and urban populations that accounts for the regional digital divide.

pub.1029709152,10.4018/jide.2010070104,Deconstructing the ‘Digital Divide’ In Africa,"The debate about whether the digital divide between Africa and the developed world is narrowing or widening has intensified over the last five years. Some believe that access to technology is positively correlated to economic development and wealth creation, however, since the dawn of the last century, the gap between the rich and the poor within and between developed and developing countries has continued to grow. The protagonists in this debate do not seem to appreciate the notion that the digital divide is not about a single technology, and is driven by a complex set of factors that exist beyond wires. This paper attempts to deconstruct the concept of the digital divide beyond access to PCs, telephones, Internet, cable TV, etc… The authors argue that the phenomenon as currently conceived is misleading and flawed, and so are the indices for its measurement. Suggestions that a new model for mapping the phenomenon is made in order to bridge the divide between developed and developing countries. In deconstructing the digital divide, the authors use the Declaration of Principles of the World Summit on Information Society and the indices used to measure e-readiness, information society, digital opportunity, and e-government.",International Journal of Innovation in the Digital Economy,2010,1,3,56-69,"Mutula, Stephen",University of Botswana,Botswana,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1029709152,0,"[Mutula, Stephen M.]|[ur.013325104101.71]|Library Review|2006|55|7|440-449|10.1108/00242530610682155|pub.1015783338|9;[Hirsch, Moshe; Nov, Avi]|[; ]|The Journal of World Investment & Trade|2004|5|1|215-226|10.1163/221190004x00371|pub.1021518297|716;[]|[]|World Pumps|2007|2007|493|6|10.1016/s0262-1762(07)70338-3|pub.1048202068|2;[Warschauer, Mark]|[]|First Monday|2002|7|7||10.5210/fm.v7i7.967|pub.1072710766|277;[Huffaker, David]|[]|First Monday|2004|9|6||10.5210/fm.v9i6.1156|pub.1072710938|76;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]||2001||||10.1017/cbo9781139164887|pub.1098663486|2054"

With data from 476 Vermont households surveyed in 2009, a double-hurdle model is used to identify the factors that impact the likelihood and frequency of using the Internet for information searching. Empirical results suggest that there are significant disparities in both the likelihood and frequency of online information searching in Vermont and that these disparities are closely associated with several socioeconomic and demographic factors such as education level, income, and age. Also, the impacts of some variables on the likelihood to use the Internet are different from their impacts on the frequency of using the Internet for information searching.

Though these technical parameters gave an initial indication of the magnitude of the digital divide, they did not provide a complete picture of its dimension and context.

The article argues that, in rhetoric at least, the innovation, adoption, and diffusion of ICTs bear the hallmark of technological determinism (i.e., that of a technical imperative) in which social, economic, and political factors are underplayed. By way of contrast, the article considers the merit of a social shaping approach to analysing innovation in ICTs, to assess the prospects for ameliorating the digital divide between developed and developing countries and for stimulating economic development in the latter through the promotion of e-business.

We adopt a generalized diffusion model that incorporates the impact of one technology's installed base on the diffusion of the other technology. We estimate the model on data from 26 developing and developed countries between 1991 and 2005. We find that the codiffusion effects between PCs and the Internet are complementary in nature and the impact of PCs on Internet diffusion is substantially stronger in developing countries as compared to developed ones. Furthermore, our results suggest that these codiffusive effects are a significant driver of the narrowing of the digital divide. We also examine the policy implications of our results, especially with respect to how complementarities in the diffusion of PC and Internet technologies might be harnessed to further accelerate the narrowing of the global digital divide.",Information Systems Research,2010,21,4,925-940,"Dewan, Sanjeev; Ganley, Dale; Kraemer, Kenneth L.","University of California, Irvine; University of Victoria",United States; Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1064711352,72,"[Quibria, M.G; Ahmed, Shamsun N; Tschang, Ted; Reyes-Macasaquit, Mari-Len]|[ur.015764721413.10; ur.010654611213.10; ur.012247552213.80; ur.015235454213.44]|Journal of Asian Economics|2003|13|6|811-825|10.1016/s1049-0078(02)00186-0|pub.1000815131|147;[Kiiski, Sampsa; Pohjola, Matti]|[ur.012603406201.20; ur.013107663011.00]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|297-310|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00071-3|pub.1001159834|314;[Danaher, Peter J.; Hardie, Bruce G.S.; Putsis, William P.]|[ur.015163571313.52; ur.014421654261.28; ur.012753134147.22]|Journal of Marketing Research|2001|38|4|501-514|10.1509/jmkr.38.4.501.18907|pub.1002065353|136;[Bucklin, Louis P.; Sengupta, Sanjit]|[ur.011354124736.64; ur.011055161243.55]|Journal of Product Innovation Management|1993|10|2|148-160|10.1016/0737-6782(93)90006-c|pub.1004475766|44;[Beilock, Richard; Dimitrova, Daniela V]|[ur.014323447013.67; ur.014237167607.22]|Telecommunications Policy|2003|27|3-4|237-252|10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00100-3|pub.1010780120|140;[Dekimpe, Marnik G.; Parker, Philip M.; Sarvary, Miklos]|[ur.012747052606.79; ur.011013173737.89; ur.013626656605.39]|Journal of Marketing Research|2000|37|1|47-59|10.1509/jmkr.37.1.47.18722|pub.1017620282|133;[Islam, Towhidul; Meade, Nigel]|[ur.014271432203.10; ur.013622104167.11]|Technological Forecasting and Social Change|1997|56|1|49-60|10.1016/s0040-1625(97)00030-9|pub.1021030434|111;[Rochet, Jean‐Charles; Tirole, Jean]|[ur.011505356472.22; ur.014227410565.23]|Journal of the European Economic Association|2003|1|4|990-1029|10.1162/154247603322493212|pub.1021949176|2692;[Kumar, V.; Ganesh, Jaishankar; Echambadi, Raj]|[ur.016445171675.69; ur.013440357255.85; ur.010672107642.13]|Journal of Product Innovation Management|1998|15|3|255-268|10.1016/s0737-6782(97)00082-9|pub.1028928652|55;[Oxley, Joanne E.; Yeung, Bernard]|[ur.012030236333.66; ur.012133101103.50]|Journal of International Business Studies|2001|32|4|705-723|10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8490991|pub.1037733456|239;[James, Jeffrey]|[]|Habitat International|2002|26|1|21-31|10.1016/s0197-3975(01)00030-3|pub.1038372458|18;[Rai, Arun; Ravichandran, T.; Samaddar, Subhashish]|[ur.015237133415.31; ur.01351253342.60; ur.013434764045.17]|Communications of the ACM|1998|41|10|97-106|10.1145/286238.286253|pub.1038497804|73;[Meade, Nigel; Islam, Towhidul]|[ur.013622104167.11; ur.014271432203.10]|International Journal of Forecasting|2006|22|3|519-545|10.1016/j.ijforecast.2006.01.005|pub.1041173366|510;[Bayus, Barry L.]|[ur.014545205265.12]|Journal of Product Innovation Management|1987|4|4|243-255|10.1016/0737-6782(87)90028-2|pub.1049198352|51;[Desiraju, Ramarao; Nair, Harikesh; Chintagunta, Pradeep]|[ur.012440073551.48; ur.014630415151.67; ur.013740312465.01]|International Journal of Research in Marketing|2004|21|4|341-357|10.1016/j.ijresmar.2004.05.001|pub.1049484251|74;[Mahajan, Vijay; Muller, Eitan]|[ur.011344150523.25; ur.016444444571.69]|Technological Forecasting and Social Change|1996|51|2|109-132|10.1016/0040-1625(95)00225-1|pub.1052451741|223;[Corrocher, Nicoletta; Ordanini, Andrea]|[ur.011256716263.36; ur.015022300133.21]|Journal of Information Technology|2002|17|1|9-19|10.1080/02683960210132061|pub.1058311977|116;[Gatignon, Hubert; Robertson, Thomas S.]|[; ]|Journal of Consumer Research|1985|11|4|849|10.1086/209021|pub.1058528608|837;[Chinn, M.

pub.1093712521,10.1109/hicss.2004.1265322,Factors Influencing the Adoption of Residential Broadband Connections to the Internet,"Broadband adoption has been slower than anticipated in the United States resulting in a number of proposed policy interventions ranging from nonintervention to extreme measures. Digital divide advocates are concerned that demographics of broadband users will reveal the same digital divide gaps that are observed in computer ownership and home Internet access. This study analyzes the factors influencing the adoption of residential broadband services using the Current Population Survey data from September 2001. Three statistical models on computer ownership, home Internet access, and broadband access are analyzed to illustrate the differences in demographics between the dependent variables. Using a logit regression model, the results show that the digital divide is the widest for computer ownership and the narrowest for broadband access. The implications of this study are that public policy interventions to bridge the digital divide should focus more on computer ownership, and less on broadband specific policies.","37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004.

We are developing a community-centred approach to learn how interaction techniques can compensate for poor communication across the digital divide. We have incorporated the lessons learned regarding social intelligence design in an abstraction and in a device called the SoftBridge. The SoftBridge allows communication to flow from endpoints through adapters, getting converted if necessary, and out to destination endpoints. Field trials are underway with two communities in South Africa: disadvantaged Deaf users and an isolated rural community. Initial lessons learned show that we have to design user interfaces that allow users to understand and cope with delay.

The paper suggests that sustainable regeneration requires a much more holistic approach to urban development than has been the case in previous strategies and policies and can benefit from using digital technologies. In order to turn the digital divide into a “digital dividend,” more emphasis needs to be placed on citizen engagement, empowerment and capacity building. This case study aims to provide examples of how a multi-agency partnership approach is working to tackle these challenges through the “ONE-Manchester” initiative (Open Network E-Manchester).",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2007,235,,19-29,"Carter, Dave",Manchester Digital Development Agency,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050175624,3,

Starting from a series of elementary indicators the methodology groups these indicators into six factors of digitalization and, subsequently, aggregates the factors in a synthetic index called the synthetic index of digitalization. The dispersion in the distribution of the synthetic indexes of digitalization constitutes the measure of the digital divide. This method is based upon a measurement approach, which is different from the ones previously developed, since it uses principal components analysis for aggregating the variables and avoids many of the problems and limits shown by existing models. In the article an application of the methodology is provided within a set of ten developed countries for 2000 and 2001. The measurement framework for the digital divide presented here reveals new policy implications for public institutions and highlights opportunities and risks for managers working in the ‘digital economy’ environment.",Journal of Information Technology,2002,17,1,9-19,"Corrocher, Nicoletta; Ordanini, Andrea",Bocconi University,Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1058311977,116,"[Abramson, Bram Dov]|[ur.010561734251.31]|Telecommunications Policy|2000|24|1|69-74|10.1016/s0308-5961(99)00072-5|pub.1001568818|21;[Ricci, Andrea]|[]|Telematics and Informatics|2000|17|1-2|141-167|10.1016/s0736-5853(00)00002-2|pub.1031906557|39;[Sampler, Jeffrey L.]|[ur.07637570743.99]|Strategic Management Journal|1998|19|4|343-355|10.1002/(sici)1097-0266(199804)19:4<343::aid-smj975>3.0.co;2-g|pub.1032827991|133;[Gorsuch, Richard L.]|[]|Multivariate Behavioral Research|1990|25|1|33-39|10.1207/s15327906mbr2501_3|pub.1034971249|224;[BORGATTA, EDGAR F.; KERCHER, KYLE; STULL, DONALD E.]|[ur.0105367312.85; ur.01327047667.45; ur.01107747321.04]|Sociological Methods & Research|1986|15|1-2|160-168|10.1177/0049124186015001011|pub.1050785745|29;[Dillon, William R.; Mulani, Narendra; Frederick, Donald G.]|[ur.0715441475.45; ur.015042321123.28; ur.015637701523.16]|Journal of Consumer Research|1989|16|1|106|10.1086/209198|pub.1058528785|35;[Webster, Frank; Webster, Frank]|[; ]||1995||||10.4324/9780203991367|pub.1109739361|333;[Brynjolfsson, Erik; Kahin, Brian]|[]|Understanding the Digital Economy|2000||||10.7551/mitpress/6986.001.0001|pub.1110624667|138"

In addition to income and demographics, we also examine quality of service and competition as components of the Digital Divide.

pub.1010150647,10.1007/3-540-36227-4_43,Digital Divide: How Can Digital Libraries Bridge the Gap?,"Recent developments in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have, while making our life easier, created a social divide known as the digital divide. Statistics show that there are significant disparities among the populations in the developed and developing world in terms of accessibility to, and use of, ICT. Research and development in digital libraries do not only require sophisticated ICT, they also call for huge investments in terms of money and intellectual resources. Developing countries are lagging behind in digital library research and development, due to the digital divide as well as the lack of appropriate resources required for research and development. As a result, users in the developing world are being deprived of digital library services. This paper argues that some recent global digital library developments can be used by users in the developing countries : subject gateways, digital reference services, free access to e-journals and e-books in many areas, e-print archives and free digital libraries. The paper ends with an action plan that may be used by library and information professionals in both developing and developed countries to exploit the benefits of these digital information resources and services. This will to some extent help to bridge the digital divide.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2002,2555,,379-391,"Chowdhury, Gobinda G.",University of Strathclyde,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010150647,8,"[Fahmi, Ismail]|[]|Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2005|28|4|19-24|10.1002/bult.242|pub.1002286497|2;[Chowdhury, Gobinda G.]|[ur.014145637467.66]|Journal of Documentation|2002|58|3|258-283|10.1108/00220410210425809|pub.1010304144|44;[Witten, Ian H.; Loots, Michel; Trujillo, Maria F.; Bainbridge, David]|[ur.014370140227.76; ur.014225523405.19; ur.015023104005.33; ur.010652771027.75]|The Electronic Library|2002|20|1|7-13|10.1108/02640470210418218|pub.1025314891|20;[Cullen, Rowena]|[ur.01027321712.95]|Online Information Review|2001|25|5|311-320|10.1108/14684520110410517|pub.1029188033|162;[Janes, Joseph; Hill, Chrystie; Rolfe, Alex]|[; ; ]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2001|52|13|1106-1121|10.1002/asi.1177|pub.1041977526|39;[Widharto]|[ur.013501706133.34]|Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2005|28|4|25-27|10.1002/bult.243|pub.1049743148|4"
pub.1002062219,10.4018/978-1-60566-026-4.ch014,African-Americans and the Digital Divide,"The Internet has become an integral part of America’s entertainment, communication, and information culture. Since the mid 1990s, the Internet has become prevalent in middle and upper-class American households. Companies and government agencies are increasingly offering products, services, and information online. Educational institutions are integrating technology into their curriculum and are offering courses from a distance. However, while some are advantaged by the efficiencies and convenience that result from these innovations, others may unwittingly become further marginalized by these same innovations since Internet access is not spreading to them as quickly. The ‘digital divide’ is the term used to describe this emerging disparity. Government analysts argue that historically underserved groups such as racial and ethnic minorities, rural and low-income communities, and older Americans are at a distinct disadvantage if this divide is not closed because American economic and social life is increasingly becoming networked through the Internet (National Telecommunications and Information Administration, 1995). Over the last decade access to the Internet has increased significantly. A 2006 Pew Internet and American Life survey shows that 73% of U.S. adults (about 147 million adults) are Internet users, up from 66% (about 133 million adults) in 2005. And the share of Americans who have broadband connections at home reached 42% (about 84 million), up from 29% (about 59 million) in 2005 (Madden, 2006). African- Americans are increasingly accessing the Internet via home broadband connections, with a 121% adoption rate in 2005 (Horrigan, 2006). But does this mean that the problem of the digital divide has been solved? Is further research in this area warranted or has the digital divide become passé? In this article, we take on these questions by first reviewing major issues and trends in digital divide research. We do so by reviewing the digital divide literature as it relates to one historically underserved group, namely African-Americans. Next, we present a conceptual framework that contrasts 1) social and technological access perspectives, and 2) assetbased/ resource and behavioral/use perspectives. The article concludes with our recommendations for future research opportunities for examining digital divide issues.","Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, Second Edition",2009,,,78-82,"Khosrow-Pour, Mehdi; Kvasny, Lynette; Payton, Fay Cobb",Pennsylvania State University; North Carolina State University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002062219,3,"[Kvasny, Lynette]|[ur.012613150205.25]|ACM SIGMIS Database the DATABASE for Advances in Information Systems|2006|37|4|13-25|10.1145/1185335.1185342|pub.1004610507|36;[Payton, Fay Cobb]|[ur.07604463107.21]|Communications of the ACM|2003|46|6|89-91|10.1145/777313.777318|pub.1026378124|27;[Kvasny, Lynette; Truex, Duane]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.013072777061.80]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2001|66||399-414|10.1007/978-0-387-35489-7_27|pub.1030914962|22;[Hacker, Kenneth L.; Mason, Shana M.]|[; ]|Ethics and Information Technology|2003|5|2|99-115|10.1023/a:1024968602974|pub.1046772669|28;[Hoffman, Donna L.; Novak, Thomas P.]|[ur.012265731146.27; ur.012777630633.16]|Science|1998|280|5362|390-391|10.1126/science.280.5362.390|pub.1062560768|271;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|First Monday|2002|7|4||10.5210/fm.v7i4.942|pub.1072710742|980;[Warschauer, Mark]|[]|First Monday|2002|7|7||10.5210/fm.v7i7.967|pub.1072710766|277;[Gurstein, Michael]|[]|First Monday|2003|8|12||10.5210/fm.v8i12.1107|pub.1072710821|187;[]|[]|Choice|2002|40|02|40-1165-40-1165|10.5860/choice.40-1165|pub.1073382743|884;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]||2001||||10.1017/cbo9781139164887|pub.1098663486|2054;[Sipior, Janice; Volonino, Linda]|[ur.011264571207.91; ur.016336460147.07]|Communications of the Association for Information Systems|2004|13|||10.17705/1cais.01305|pub.1109866670|9"

But what is digital or social inclusion? The purpose of this paper is to explore the notion of social exclusion as a variety of, sometimes conflicting, social programmes which embody ideas of what society should be. Becoming more aware of this variety of approach can give insights into programmes addressing the digital divide and the political, cultural and social aspects of policies of social inclusion.   Design/methodology/approach The paper analyses the notion of social inclusion as a variety of social policies to address social exclusion and develop the nation state. It uses an example of a telecentre in Jordan's knowledge station (KS) programme to illustrate and extend this analysis.   Findings The analysis and discussion of the KS initiative shows how different notions of social and digital inclusion are important features of strengthening the Jordanian state and are useful in analysing the relative success of this programme.   Originality/value The paper argues that analyses of digital divides and digital exclusion could be strengthened by a closer understanding of policies of social inclusion. In this way it is possible to move from technological connection as a measure of a digital divide to a more thorough understanding using social inclusion policy which illuminates social, political and cultural aspects of technological change.",Journal of Information Communication and Ethics in Society,2009,7,2/3,146-158,"Al‐Jaghoub, Saheer; Westrup, Chris",Al-Ahliyya Amman University; University of Manchester,Jordan; United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033290534,12,"[Strover, Sharon]|[ur.012341524001.11]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|275-277|10.1080/01972240309481|pub.1004177104|40;[Bell, Daniel]|[]|The Educational Forum|1976|40|4|574-579|10.1080/00131727609336501|pub.1026003223|466;[Amawi, Abla M.]|[]|Middle East Policy|1996|4|4|77-89|10.1111/j.1475-4967.1996.tb00238.x|pub.1026764867|3;[Wiktorowicz, Quintan]|[ur.016320732143.47]|World Development|2002|30|1|77-93|10.1016/s0305-750x(01)00092-4|pub.1037228359|82;[van Dijk, Jan; Hacker, Kenneth]|[; ]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|315-326|10.1080/01972240309487|pub.1047421245|709;[Wheeler, Deborah L.]|[ur.07731506227.61]|Ethics and Information Technology|2006|8|3|131-142|10.1007/s10676-006-9122-2|pub.1047707922|8;[Warschauer, Mark]|[]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|297-304|10.1080/01972240309490|pub.1051403945|133;[Molla, Alemayehu; Jaghoub, Saheer Al]|[; ]|International Journal of Knowledge and Learning|2007|3|6|592|10.1504/ijkl.2007.016835|pub.1067468246|12;[]|[]|The Psychology of Literacy|1981||||10.4159/harvard.9780674433014|pub.1099346949|1596;[Mofleh, Samer; Wanous, Mohammed; Strachan, Peter]|[ur.014625415677.39; ur.016220356677.56; ur.011247141507.84]|The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries|2008|34|1|1-17|10.1002/j.1681-4835.2008.tb00236.x|pub.1099622850|22;[Wade, Robert Hunter]|[]|Global Governance A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations|2002|8|4|443-466|10.1163/19426720-00804005|pub.1110306217|100;[]|[]|Technology and Social Inclusion|2004||||10.7551/mitpress/6699.001.0001|pub.1110624278|439"

In general, the concept represents that as technology advances, some groups within society gain greater access to more efficient technology while other groups that are unable or unwilling to participate in the use of technology are left behind. This lack of participation in the digital world is considered to place these individuals or groups at a disadvantage relative to their more connected peers. The term “digital divide” also describes information technology disparities between nations and technical accessibility disparities within smaller societal groups. Although this issue has been researched for over a decade, both the concept and proposed solutions to problems related to technology access are controversial.

pub.1017869859,10.4018/978-1-60566-699-0.ch009,"Teleworking and the ""Disability Divide""","Much of the discourse on the digital divide focuses on issues of information disparity and accessibility, frequently in socioeconomic terms. This perspective overlooks an important aspect of the digital divide, the lack of access and missed opportunities faced by persons with disabilities, referred to here as the “disability divide.” Barriers to access and knowledgeable use of information and communication technology (ICT) represent more than simple exclusion from information to encompass social segregation and devaluation. At its most insidious, barriers to ICTs limit full community engagement in employment activities. This chapter examines the ramification of the impact of digital divide on the nature of employment and participation in the workplace, using ICT to conduct telework, and explores challenges to social policy with respect to ‘reasonable’ accommodations. In the absence of practices, structures, and policies targeting the distributive work environment, telework is much less likely to close the digital divide for persons with a disability. This suggests the need to explore and develop potential policy options to close the disability divide.",Handbook of Research on Overcoming Digital Divides,2010,,,155-178,"Ferro, Enrico; Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Gil-Garcia, J.

The research, conducted through questionnaires, focuses on fifth‐grade students in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area because state‐mandated test results for core subjects are available at the state Department of Education web site. Thus, it allows the researchers to collect data on both technology accessibility and academic achievement. The findings show that the digital divide still exists, cutting through various socioeconomic factors, and that the relationship between technology accessibility and academic achievement may also exist, although it is very much complicated by other compounding factors, such as the subjects of learning, the uses of technology, and socioeconomic conditions. It is hoped that the findings of this research can help policy makers, school administrators and teachers better understand the issues of digital divide and the consequences of technology use in schools and beyond. This study addresses the problem of digital divide in the public school system and investigates how it affects students' academic achievement.",The Electronic Library,2006,24,2,160-173,"Huang, Jie; Russell, Susan",University of Oklahoma,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021724615,27,"[FOSTER, STEPHEN PAUL]|[]|The International Information & Library Review|2000|32|3-4|437-451|10.1006/iilr.2000.0136|pub.1015083004|15;[Cullen, Rowena]|[ur.01027321712.95]|The Electronic Library|2003|21|3|247-257|10.1108/02640470310480506|pub.1016234847|46;[Parker, Brett]|[]|The Electronic Library|2003|21|5|456-460|10.1108/02640470310499830|pub.1022560171|6;[KARGBO, JOHN ABDUL]|[ur.013776570121.94]|The International Information & Library Review|2002|34|1|97-105|10.1006/iilr.2002.0187|pub.1038188907|7;[Katsinas, Stephen G.; Moeck, Patricia]|[ur.015367537603.01; ]|Community College Journal of Research and Practice|2002|26|3|207-224|10.1080/106689202317245419|pub.1041980013|26;[GORDON, J.

The disadvantaged have traditionally included the less educated, nonwhites, females, the elderly, lower income people and third world citizens. Scholars are now beginning to go beyond basic issues of access to address differences in Internet experiences among Internet users. However, few digital divide researchers focus on the importance and impacts of the various types of connections people use to log onto the Internet. Among U.S. Internet users, we examine which is more important in determining Internet use, the traditional digital divide factors or type of connection. This study examines a wide range of online activities that provide vital information and services for Internet users.

I suggest instead two separate indexes for means and ends, which can be more usefully related to one another in terms of productivity (one index divided by the other), or as dependent and independent variables (one index in a functional relationship to the other).",Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,2008,59,5,785-791,"James, Jeffrey",Tilburg University,Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005673281,11,"[Quibria, M.G; Ahmed, Shamsun N; Tschang, Ted; Reyes-Macasaquit, Mari-Len]|[ur.015764721413.10; ur.010654611213.10; ur.012247552213.80; ur.015235454213.44]|Journal of Asian Economics|2003|13|6|811-825|10.1016/s1049-0078(02)00186-0|pub.1000815131|147;[Sagar, Ambuj D; Najam, Adil]|[ur.013675350465.97; ur.014305115136.80]|Ecological Economics|1998|25|3|249-264|10.1016/s0921-8009(97)00168-7|pub.1007005696|386"

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the validity of that claim in the case of the Isle of Man (IOM).   Design/methodology/approach A nominalist ontology and positivist epistemology characterizes the underpinning research philosophy for this case study. Research data consisted of secondary census instruments and primary data derived from interviews with a sample of IOM civil servants.   Findings The findings were that despite having better results in terms of the causes of digital divide, the IOM trailed the UK level of internet access to a significant degree. This result raises questions about the wisdom of basing digital divide and e‐government strategies on technology proliferation and economic indicators.   Research limitations/implications The IOM is a comparatively small entity compared to the UK. In addition, basing the primary data collected on IOM civil servants only may result in an element of bias.   Practical implications Many governments invest considerable sums of money on their digital divide and e‐government programmes which may be misdirected if they are addressing the wrong causes of it.

However, the information society resulted information inequality issues and especially to those disabled people, who have more difficulties on the technology adaptation, the ""digital divide"" symptom is significantly found. At present the rapid development of IT has gone beyond the level of the information society and it is accelerating the ubiquitous society that will combine people, computers, and all objects into one. And during the time of ubiquitous the ""digital divide"" will still exist. This research is focused on the digital divide of disabled people that were insufficiently covered in the research of digital divide and ubiquitous. From the empirical study of the effect that the disabled contributes on the service usability in U-City, the factors of background of the digital divide, and the difference of such factors in types of sex, ages, disabled types, and disabled class, and finally how the ubiquitous divide of the disabled affects have been researched. Based on the proposed study model and by analyzing the model by structural equation, following resulted was gained. (1) With the TAM (TAM : Technology Acceptance Model), which is commonly used in the studies of IT devices and services, the digital divide of the disabled cases cannot be identified sufficiently since it is not eligible for Using Intention of U-City Services. (2) In case of the disabled, the mental factors like willingness to overcome the impediment and accessibility like environment to meet the information services and ability to access the services are more effective on Using Intention of U-City Services rather than TAM.",The Journal of Information Systems,2008,17,2,95-112,"Lee, Mi-Gyeong; Kang, Ju-Young; Lee, Sang-Gun",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002297389,1,"[Hawkins, Eliza Tanner; Hawkins, Kirk A.]|[ur.010552422300.76; ur.07614364457.64]|Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly|2003|80|3|646-665|10.1177/107769900308000310|pub.1012320828|39;[Davis, Fred D.; Bagozzi, Richard P.; Warshaw, Paul R.]|[ur.014060724401.60; ur.0712073700.63; ur.015250026703.09]|Journal of Applied Social Psychology|1992|22|14|1111-1132|10.1111/j.1559-1816.1992.tb00945.x|pub.1035983250|3300;[Brady, Michael K; Cronin, J.Joseph; Brand, Richard R]|[ur.014736547210.82; ur.07763112171.17; ur.015070060045.28]|Journal of Business Research|2002|55|1|17-31|10.1016/s0148-2963(00)00171-5|pub.1048504531|497;[Venkatesh, Viswanath; Davis, Fred D.]|[ur.01361072103.18; ur.014060724401.60]|Decision Sciences|1996|27|3|451-481|10.1111/j.1540-5915.1996.tb01822.x|pub.1061944287|1546;[Taylor, Shirley; Todd, Peter A.]|[; ]|Information Systems Research|1995|6|2|144-176|10.1287/isre.6.2.144|pub.1064711982|4357"

The empirical results show that the digital divide, on one hand, widens the growth gap between countries. On the other hand, the global ICT diffusion generates ICT externalities, which have positive effects on the total factor productivity of less-developed countries. Therefore, the global digitalization may have both negative impacts, manifested in a widening digital divide and growth gap, and positive impacts reflected in the effects of knowledge spillovers. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Information Technology for Development,2006,12,2,159-173,"Seo, Hwan‐Joo; Lee, Young Soo",Sangji University; Korea Aerospace University,South Korea; South Korea,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001267604,21,"[Kiiski, Sampsa; Pohjola, Matti]|[ur.012603406201.20; ur.013107663011.00]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|297-310|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00071-3|pub.1001159834|314;[Baliamoune‐Lutz, Mina]|[ur.07704711743.28]|Information Technology for Development|2003|10|3|151-169|10.1002/itdj.1590100303|pub.1004608331|204;[Lucas, Robert E.]|[]|Journal of Monetary Economics|1988|22|1|3-42|10.1016/0304-3932(88)90168-7|pub.1006035902|10501;[Kraemer, Kenneth L.; Dedrick, Jason]|[ur.01003675072.26; ur.012525264627.36]|World Development|1994|22|12|1921-1931|10.1016/0305-750x(94)90183-x|pub.1008121327|101;[Arora, Ashish; Athreye, Suma]|[ur.014352322573.41; ur.011355325271.96]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|253-273|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00069-5|pub.1014040582|134;[]|[]|Long Range Planning|1992|25|3|130|10.1016/0024-6301(92)90431-z|pub.1024597567|1450;[Jalava, Jukka; Pohjola, Matti]|[ur.012713076467.26; ur.013107663011.00]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|189-210|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00066-x|pub.1026761325|140;[Colecchia, Alessandra; Schreyer, Paul]|[ur.015264077001.09; ur.016061457401.21]|OECD Journal Economic Studies|2003|2002|1|153-171|10.1787/eco_studies-v2002-art5-en|pub.1032777725|41;[Coe, David T.; Helpman, Elhanan]|[ur.012476661623.30; ur.013455356743.30]|European Economic Review|1995|39|5|859-887|10.1016/0014-2921(94)00100-e|pub.1037176216|2454;[Barro, Robert J; Lee, Jong-Wha]|[ur.01313542524.54; ur.015213046613.87]|Journal of Monetary Economics|1993|32|3|363-394|10.1016/0304-3932(93)90023-9|pub.1051389315|973;[Romer, Paul M.]|[ur.016404664534.32]|Journal of Political Economy|1986|94|5|1002-1037|10.1086/261420|pub.1058574901|9255;[Ben-David, D]|[]|Oxford Economic Papers|2000|52|4|637-650|10.1093/oep/52.4.637|pub.1059948606|34;[Daveri, F.]|[]|Oxford Review of Economic Policy|2002|18|3|345-362|10.1093/oxrep/18.3.345|pub.1059967089|119;[Machin, Stephen; Van Reenen, John]|[ur.01250235220.68; ur.010404244713.16]|The Quarterly Journal of Economics|1998|113|4|1215-1244|10.1162/003355398555883|pub.1063349116|588;[Caselli, Francesco; Coleman, Wilbur John]|[ur.0707661350.95; ur.016237233756.43]|American Economic Review|2001|91|2|328-335|10.1257/aer.91.2.328|pub.1064527229|343;[Oliner, Stephen D; Sichel, Daniel E]|[ur.012303224745.40; ur.012566361004.04]|Journal of Economic Perspectives|2000|14|4|3-22|10.1257/jep.14.4.3|pub.1064530097|782;[Dewan, Sanjeev; Kraemer, Kenneth L.]|[ur.014741726610.51; ur.01003675072.26]|Management Science|2000|46|4|548-562|10.1287/mnsc.46.4.548.12057|pub.1064721996|471;[Young, Allyn A.]|[]|The Economic Journal|1928|38|152|527|10.2307/2224097|pub.1069838829|1371;[Kaldor, Nicholas]|[]|The Economic Journal|1957|67|268|591|10.2307/2227704|pub.1069841936|1136;[Kaldor, Nicholas]|[]|The Economic Journal|1975|85|340|891|10.2307/2230633|pub.1069844581|122;[Bernstein, Jeffrey I.; Nadiri, M.

pub.1037137974,10.15719/geba.10.4.200911.319,Aging Society and Digital Divide: Analysis of Determinant Factor for Digital Divide,"As aging population is on the steep rise with the advent of the digital era, digital alienation is emerging as a social and economic issue. In this regards, it is urgent to shape policies to address a digital divide between the young and the old. The study is to analyze the factors affecting the digital divide in a theoretical and empirical way, providing policy alternatives to narrow the digital divide. The study is summarized as follows: The analysis of the status of digital divide between the young and the old shows the Internet usage by the elderly (that is, those over 50 years old) is 28.3%, significantly lower than that by the young. Moreover, as the age becomes higher, the usage rate tends to be rapidly decreasing. In particular, the usage rate is much lower among those with lower education, lower income, and non-office jobs. Also, the empirical analysis of the usage and utilization of information goods by the aging population reveals that people tend to be reluctant adopting and utilizing the information technology as it gets older, making it necessary to support the utilization of information goods as well as the adoption. Based on the analysis, the study provides ways to bridge the digital divide between the young and the old from the following three perspectives. First, for the information approach, it is required to provide low-end or used personal computers with Internet connection; develop and support technologies ensuring universal access to the information resources; and supply new devices available as telecommunications and broadcasting becomes converged and the digital broadcasting is introduced. Second, to boost the information technology proficiency of the elderly, it is needed to provide IT training programs for the older people with the support from the private sector; reinforce the customized IT education and training programs; come up with a variety of ways of providing education; and have advanced IT programs, in order to promote the elderly's participation in the economy. Third, to encourage the utilization of information technology, it is necessary to create jobs and provide relevant information to the aging population, promoting their participation in the economy; support the older people utilize IT facilities, upgrading the welfare services; and develop content for education and lifelong education programs.",The e-Business Studies,2009,10,4,319-350,"Noh, Yong-Hwan; 김원중; 김정언",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037137974,3,

E-services improve the responsiveness, efficiency and transparency of the public sector. Unfortunately, these benefits may not be realized by the entire population. A digital divide exists in society, both from an access point of view and from a skills point of view. This study explores the potential effects of the digital divide on e-government by surveying a diverse group of citizens to identify the demographic characteristics that impact use of e-government services. The results indicate that income, education, age and frequency of Internet use significantly impact the use of e-government services. We discuss the implications of these findings and provide suggestions for future research.",Proceedings of the 39th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'06),2006,4,,1-7,"Bélanger, France; Carter, Lemuria",Virginia Tech,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095244315,62,"[Ho, Alfred Tat‐Kei]|[ur.015771663665.85]|Public Administration Review|2002|62|4|434-444|10.1111/0033-3352.00197|pub.1004381953|639;[Marche, Sunny; McNiven, James D.]|[ur.012615377351.59; ur.01150221542.25]|Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences / Revue Canadienne des Sciences de l Administration|2009|20|1|74-86|10.1111/j.1936-4490.2003.tb00306.x|pub.1004613078|166;[KELLEY, CATHERINE L.; CHAESS, NEIL]|[; ]|Behaviour and Information Technology|1995|14|2|107-120|10.1080/01449299508914630|pub.1007633395|143;[Jaeger, Paul T; Thompson, Kim M]|[ur.011542112017.14; ur.014776367265.07]|Government Information Quarterly|2003|20|4|389-394|10.1016/j.giq.2003.08.001|pub.1009664461|269;[Marchionini, Gary; Samet, Hanan; Brandt, Larry]|[ur.012405116227.61; ur.016505260021.44; ur.07560443242.32]|Communications of the ACM|2003|46|1|24-27|10.1145/602421.602440|pub.1013740207|49;[West, Darrell M.]|[ur.01162163276.52]|Public Administration Review|2004|64|1|15-27|10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00343.x|pub.1018513639|794;[Carter, Lemuria; Bélanger, France]|[ur.010501313522.42; ur.07347634165.87]|Information Systems Journal|2005|15|1|5-25|10.1111/j.1365-2575.2005.00183.x|pub.1020923035|1145;[Potter, Andrew]|[]|Government Information Quarterly|2002|29|5|303-317|10.1016/s1352-0237(03)00053-4|pub.1022928417|44;[Hazlett, Shirley‐Ann; Hill, Frances]|[ur.016073522273.25; ur.011264767661.32]|Managing Service Quality: An International Journal|2003|13|6|445-452|10.1108/09604520310506504|pub.1024684098|89;[Bertot, John Carlo]|[ur.011253735727.32]|Government Information Quarterly|2003|20|2|185-191|10.1016/s0740-624x(03)00036-4|pub.1027199920|96;[Belanger, France; Hiller, Janine S.]|[ur.07347634165.87; ur.01043403420.02]|Business Process Management Journal|2006|12|1|48-60|10.1108/14637150610643751|pub.1028296710|109;[Vigoda, Eran]|[ur.011643410303.09]|Public Administration Review|2002|62|5|527-540|10.1111/1540-6210.00235|pub.1028400693|446;[Koga, Takashi]|[]|Government Information Quarterly|2003|20|1|47-62|10.1016/s0740-624x(02)00134-x|pub.1037488583|13;[Moon, M.

By focusing on the implementation of the two projects, the chapter illustrates their contribution in practically using the broadband technologies in overcoming the hurdles to bridging the digital divide, and highlights the critical success factors as identified during the functioning of the projects which helped the states in achieving their goals. The chapter also reveals through its analysis that the accessibility of services through broadband technology have brought an opportunity to the citizens to become a part of the current knowledge revolution, besides bringing about a great technological transformation to the areas where it is implemented, and thus contributed to bridging the digital divide. The chapter is finally concluded by proving that moving from a manual to electronic process with broadband technology as an enabler; the States set an example, which will serve as a set of guidelines for application of similar projects in other geographical settings.",Handbook of Research on Global Diffusion of Broadband Data Transmission,2008,,,30-46,"Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Papazafeiropoulou, Anastasia; Choudrie, Jyoti; Radhakumari, Challa",Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning,India,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026077607,0,

pub.1002252553,10.1080/13600810500137889,"Policy Reform, Economic Growth and the Digital Divide","Rapid growth of internet use in high-income economies has raised the spectre of a “digital divide” that will marginalize developing countries because they can neither afford internet access nor use it effectively when it is available. Using a new cross-country data set, this paper investigates two proximate determinants of the digital divide: internet intensity (internet subscriptions per telephone mainline); and access to telecom services. Surprisingly, no gap in internet intensity was found. When differences in urbanization and competition policy are controlled for, low-income countries have intensities as high as those of industrial countries. While income does not seem to matter in this context, competition policy matters a great deal. Low-income countries with high World Bank ratings for competition policy have significantly higher internet intensities. The paper's finding on internet intensity implies that the digital divide is not really new, but reflects a persistent gap in the availability of mainline telephone services. After identifying mobile telephones as a promising new platform for internet access, the paper uses panel data to study the determinants of mobile telephone diffusion during the past decade. The results show that income explains part of the diffusion lag for the poor countries, but they also highlight the critical role of policy. Developing countries whose policies promote economic growth and private sector competition have experienced much more rapid diffusion of mobile phone service.

pub.1052407559,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2010.11.004,Understanding the new digital divide—A typology of Internet users in Europe,"The purpose of this study is to better understand the digital divide by identifying the variety of ways in which people in Europe use the Internet. First, by using cluster analysis on survey data (N=12,666/age: 16–74 years) from Eurostat on Internet usage in Norway, Sweden, Austria, the UK, and Spain, we identified five user types: Non-Users (42%), Sporadic Users (18%), Instrumental Users (18%), Entertainment Users (10%), and Advanced Users (12%). These user types differ in their distributions over country, age, access, household members, and gender. An alarming finding is that 60% of the population was found to be either Non-Users or Sporadic Users, which reflects a large digital divide in Europe. Second, we conducted a logistic regression to identify the predictors for different user types. We found on a cross-national level that age and Internet access are the most salient predictors, whereas gender and household seems to be less relevant. However, the amount of variance explained differs between countries. We also suggested a future increase in the digital divide between the identified user types—a user type divide. The user typology and the identified predictors might help researchers, practitioners, and decision makers to better understand Internet users and the multi-complex variations among individuals and countries. This knowledge will also serve as a means to understand the digital divide by providing a more nuanced perspective on Europeans' unequal usage of the Internet and participation in an increasingly digital society.",International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,2011,69,3,123-138,"Brandtzæg, Petter Bae; Heim, Jan; Karahasanović, Amela",SINTEF; University of Oslo,Norway; Norway,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052407559,208,"[Heim, Jan; Brandtzæg, Petter Bae; Kaare, Birgit Hertzberg; Endestad, Tor; Torgersen, Leila]|[ur.011365600311.80; ur.012070403631.16; ur.011501265301.67; ur.01062611534.77; ur.0720344335.81]|New Media & Society|2007|9|3|425-454|10.1177/1461444807076971|pub.1000197197|49;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|Sociological Inquiry|2010|80|1|92-113|10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x|pub.1001393372|816;[Barnes, Stuart J.; Bauer, Hans H.; Neumann, Marcus M.; Huber, Frank]|[ur.010235354723.91; ur.015612237503.19; ur.010502127303.02; ur.014015042474.54]|European Journal of Marketing|2007|41|1/2|71-93|10.1108/03090560710718120|pub.1008762167|116;[Kozinets, Robert V]|[ur.016056401215.51]|European Management Journal|1999|17|3|252-264|10.1016/s0263-2373(99)00004-3|pub.1018906836|880;[Van Dijck, José; Nieborg, David]|[ur.013052035653.32; ur.013765240155.73]|New Media & Society|2009|11|5|855-874|10.1177/1461444809105356|pub.1022788677|152;[Colley, Ann; Maltby, John]|[ur.010723166662.42; ur.01133557444.27]|Computers in Human Behavior|2008|24|5|2005-2013|10.1016/j.chb.2007.09.002|pub.1028834008|76;[]|[]|Foundations of SQL Server 2005 Business Intelligence|2007|||243-276|10.1007/978-1-4302-0248-6_11|pub.1030728786|792;[Brandtzæg, Petter Bae; Følstad, Asbjørn; Heim, Jan]|[ur.012070403631.16; ur.010636043621.45; ur.011365600311.80]|Human–Computer Interaction Series|2003|3||55-65|10.1007/1-4020-2967-5_6|pub.1032025073|26;[Karahasanović, Amela; Brandtzæg, Petter Bae; Heim, Jan; Lüders, Marika; Vermeir, Lotte; Pierson, Jo; Lievens, Bram; Vanattenhoven, Jeroen; Jans, Greet]|[ur.013320474237.30; ur.012070403631.16; ur.011365600311.80; ur.014765354667.54; ; ur.07660366315.76; ur.01136133123.70; ur.013464355475.84; ur.012307531556.09]|Computers in Human Behavior|2009|25|3|655-678|10.1016/j.chb.2008.08.012|pub.1034570778|85;[Livingstone, Sonia; Helsper, Ellen]|[ur.014400337707.47; ur.014711443745.96]|New Media & Society|2007|9|4|671-696|10.1177/1461444807080335|pub.1041353721|639;[Hargittai, Eszter; Shafer, Steven]|[ur.014036273417.00; ]|Social Science Quarterly|2006|87|2|432-448|10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00389.x|pub.1046090236|415;[Brandtzæg, Petter Bae]|[ur.012070403631.16]|Computers in Human Behavior|2010|26|5|940-956|10.1016/j.chb.2010.02.008|pub.1048305380|126;[Dholakia, Ruby Roy]|[ur.014004014271.17]|The Information Society|2006|22|4|231-240|10.1080/01972240600791374|pub.1050716455|45;[Webster, Frank]|[]||2006||||10.4324/9780203962824|pub.1052208309|96;[Hargittai, Eszter; Walejko, Gina]|[ur.014036273417.00; ur.010661036505.46]|Information Communication & Society|2008|11|2|239-256|10.1080/13691180801946150|pub.1052284682|463;[Livingstone, Sonia; Bovill, Moira]|[ur.014400337707.47; ]||2001||||10.4324/9781410605184|pub.1053701385|99;[]|[]|The Library Quarterly|2001|71|2|270-271|10.1086/603266|pub.1058808748|118;[Johnson, Genevieve Marie; Kulpa, Anastasia]|[ur.011717457052.27; ur.010345253643.10]|Cyberpsychology Behavior and Social Networking|2007|10|6|773-780|10.1089/cpb.2007.0043|pub.1059246990|37;[Howard, P.E.N.; Rainie, L.; Jones, S.]|[; ur.013223520340.72; ur.015414041740.33]|American Behavioral Scientist|2001|45|3|383-404|10.1177/00027640121957259|pub.1063544514|265;[Selwyn, Neil; Gorard, Stephen; Furlong, John]|[ur.010274414500.72; ur.013540425157.90; ur.015440007171.58]|European Journal of Communication|2005|20|1|5-26|10.1177/0267323105049631|pub.1063796540|100;[Katz, Elihu; Haas, Hadassah; Gurevitch, Michael]|[ur.015145613433.66; ; ur.072657172.48]|American Sociological Review|1973|38|2|164|10.2307/2094393|pub.1069756352|861;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|First Monday|2002|7|4||10.5210/fm.v7i4.942|pub.1072710742|980;[Loosen, Wiebke]|[ur.0630565361.60]|First Monday|2002|7|8||10.5210/fm.v7i8.977|pub.1072710776|7;[]|[]|Choice|2007|44|05|44-2540-44-2540|10.5860/choice.44-2540|pub.1073414245|67;[Davis, Fred D.]|[]|MIS Quarterly|1989|13|3|319|10.2307/249008|pub.1102514932|25625;[Venkatesh; Morris; Davis; Davis]|[ur.012207572032.74; ur.013005152432.16; ; ]|MIS Quarterly|2003|27|3|425|10.2307/30036540|pub.1102515221|16354"

This paper argues that a knowledge-based approach provides an effective means to understand and develop responses to various forms of disadvantage related to access and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). In developing this idea one area of social network analysis is used to make the claim that social networks are used by people to configure an ontology to negotiate the uncertainty of their day-to-day existence. It follows then that digital divide factors can be understood in terms of ICT facilitated knowledge development and related processes.

In December 2003, the United Nations held a World Summit on the Information Society to adopt a declaration that embodies, in its draft form at least, ""the ambitious vision"" of ""bridging the digital divide."" The declaration's hopes focus on the rapid pace of development of ICTs (information and communication technologies) unprecedented in history - which allows for the development of applications that make it possible that no one is left behind and that those who were left marginalised in previous development cycles can have a real opportunity to attain higher levels of development without having to follow the traditional path nor its time requirements.

Bridging this global digital divide has now become an important development policy of many governments in the developing world. Differing from previous studies that look at the Internet's popularity, this paper focuses on the speed of diffusion of such technologies over the period from 1997 to 2002 in order to highlight its role as a critical driving force in enhancing the social learning of a country. Our empirical results show that a country with better social learning can harmonize its heterogeneous populations, promote the sharing of knowledge as a result of using such technologies, and finally speed up the rate of information technology diffusion.",Kyklos,2006,59,2,307-321,"Liu, Meng‐chun; San, Gee",National Central University,Taiwan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039271036,36,"[Quibria, M.G; Ahmed, Shamsun N; Tschang, Ted; Reyes-Macasaquit, Mari-Len]|[ur.015764721413.10; ur.010654611213.10; ur.012247552213.80; ur.015235454213.44]|Journal of Asian Economics|2003|13|6|811-825|10.1016/s1049-0078(02)00186-0|pub.1000815131|147;[Kiiski, Sampsa; Pohjola, Matti]|[ur.012603406201.20; ur.013107663011.00]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|297-310|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00071-3|pub.1001159834|314;[Wong, Poh-Kam]|[ur.015333364767.86]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|167-187|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00065-8|pub.1002363516|85;[Williams, Margaret L.; Frolick, Mark N.]|[; ur.015344330515.65]|Information Systems Management|2001|18|2|47-53|10.1201/1078/43195.18.2.20010301/31277.8|pub.1016922827|28;[Rahman, Mahfuzur]|[]||2002||||10.1007/978-1-4615-1547-0|pub.1039434214|4;[Reppelin-Hill, Valérie]|[ur.014001161126.34]|Journal of Environmental Economics and Management|1999|38|3|283-301|10.1006/jeem.1999.1085|pub.1041526024|95;[Munshi, Kaivan]|[ur.01246043140.72]|Journal of Development Economics|2004|73|1|185-213|10.1016/j.jdeveco.2003.03.003|pub.1043209451|447;[Church, Jeffrey; Gandal, Neil]|[ur.013031266441.20; ur.015357666271.22]|International Journal of Industrial Organization|1993|11|2|239-260|10.1016/0167-7187(93)90006-x|pub.1046276408|153;[Pissarides, C.

Much of the Web remains inaccessible or difficult to access by people across a spectrum of disabilities and this may have serious implications for the potential use of the Web for increasing social inclusion. The topic of disabled Web access is introduced through a consideration of four discourses: digital divide, social construction of disability, legal, and Web accessibility. The lack of dialogue between these permits a passive liberal approach toward disability discrimination to prevail and this political position has become inscribed in widely used automatic software tools resulting in a reinforcement of the view that Web site accessibility approval may, in many cases, be deemed an empty shell.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2006,208,,217-228,"Adam, Alison; Kreps, David",University of Salford,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049331009,8,"[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|New Media & Society|2004|6|3|341-362|10.1177/1461444804042519|pub.1003317453|630;[Adam, Alison]|[]||2005||||10.1057/9780230000520|pub.1013207499|42;[Goggin, Christopher Newell Gerard]|[]|The Information Society|2000|16|2|127-133|10.1080/01972240050032889|pub.1017914438|40;[*, Baorong Guo; Bricout, John C.; Huang, Jin]|[; ; ]|Disability & Society|2005|20|1|49-66|10.1080/0968759042000283638|pub.1023509754|77;[Ritchie, Heather; Blanck, Peter]|[ur.01242213444.66; ur.01024274601.32]|Behavioral Sciences & the Law|2003|21|1|5-26|10.1002/bsl.520|pub.1027558512|71;[Kurniawan, Sri; Zaphiris, Panayiotis; Kreps, David; Adam, Alison]|[; ; ur.014201175023.52; ur.014361323573.45]|Advances in Universal Web Design and Evaluation|2007|||25-42|10.4018/978-1-59904-096-7.ch002|pub.1030426611|1;[Trauth, Eileen M.; Quesenberry, Jeria L.; Morgan, Allison J.]|[ur.07421642022.90; ur.012310537371.58; ur.012221761437.38]|Proceedings of the 2004 conference on Computer personnel research Careers, culture, and ethics in a networked environment - SIGMIS CPR '04|2004|||114-119|10.1145/982372.982400|pub.1033309200|60;[Cooper, Joel; Weaver, Kimberlee D.]|[; ur.0770707336.29]||2003||||10.4324/9781410608932|pub.1034254512|181;[SELWYN, NEIL]|[ur.010274414500.72]|Journal of Social Policy|2002|31|1|1-20|10.1017/s0047279402006487|pub.1035487375|74;[Winner, Langdon]|[ur.01333216147.94]|ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society|1997|27|3|14-19|10.1145/270858.270864|pub.1040957157|50;[Hoque, Kim; Noon, Mike]|[ur.016025530735.35; ur.010762506503.62]|Work Employment and Society|2004|18|3|481-506|10.1177/0950017004045547|pub.1050925259|167;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]||2001||||10.1017/cbo9781139164887|pub.1098663486|2054;[Servon, Lisa J.]|[]|Bridging the Digital Divide|2002||||10.1002/9780470773529|pub.1109492537|180"

pub.1041044173,10.1108/13287260810897738,Barriers to ICT adoption in SMEs: how to bridge the digital divide?,"The purpose of this paper is to report findings of a study conducted on micro and small enterprises (SMEs) from selected regions of Spain, Portugal and Poland, and to compare them with the results of a similar survey carried out in California (USA). The European and US research studies focus on issues regarding the use of information and communication technology (ICT) solutions by SMEs and digital divide phenomena which exist between SMEs and large corporations. The data collected during face‐to‐face interviews with SMEs' owner–managers and employees from Spain, Portugal, Poland and the USA were used for making a comparative analysis based on descriptive statistical methods. Analyzing the barriers that discourage SMEs from using information and communication technology (ICT) and e‐Business solutions in their business processes made it possible to identify the reasons for SMEs being on the “wrong side” of the digital divide. The paper argues that the main barrier to better utilization of ICT and e‐Business, and thus the main reason why SMEs face a digital divide, is not so much the lack of access to information technology (“material access” barrier) as the lack of proper knowledge, education and skilled owner‐managers and employees within the enterprise (“skills access” barrier). As long as European SMEs do not realize this fact, so long will the scale of the digital divide in Europe continue to grow. The main limitation of the approach presented in this paper is related to the sample differences between Spain, Portugal, Poland and the USA. This made it impossible to carry out precise comparative statistical analysis of the results. Despite these methodological imperfections, it was possible to put forward certain recommendations on the directions of activities focusing on enhancing e‐Business adoption in SMEs. The main conclusion is that the actions aimed at bridging the digital divide in SMEs should concentrate on overcoming the “skills access” and “usage access” barriers within SMEs, not the material ones. The comparison of the way these problems are perceived by European and US owner‐managers is an added value of the paper, which brings new content to the existing discussion on barriers to the implementation of ICTs in SMEs. This approach is a step forward in analyzing the determinants and the mechanism of the digital divide within SMEs and has the potential to diminish the scale of this problem.",Journal of Systems and Information Technology,2008,10,2,93-108,"Arendt, Lukasz",University of Łódź,Poland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041044173,80,"[Chesher, Mike; Skok, Walter]|[; ur.012321422546.42]|Proceedings of the 2000 ACM SIGCPR conference on Computer personnel research  - SIGCPR '00|2000|||16-22|10.1145/333334.333338|pub.1003219016|11;[Ferlander, Sara; Timms, Duncan]|[ur.0627715457.58; ur.0702464615.15]|Information Communication & Society|2006|9|2|137-159|10.1080/13691180600630732|pub.1005544128|17;[Graham, Stephen]|[]|Urban Studies|2002|39|1|33-56|10.1080/00420980220099050|pub.1010968716|244;[Gómez Barroso, José Luis; Pérez Martínez, Jorge]|[ur.013236352471.21; ur.014217764705.35]|Universal Access in the Information Society|2004|3|3-4|264-271|10.1007/s10209-004-0103-0|pub.1011613866|7;[Holloway, Darren]|[]|Information Communication & Society|2005|8|2|168-193|10.1080/13691180500146276|pub.1014447377|18;[Beynon‐Davies, Paul; Hill, Rebecca]|[ur.011263571011.65; ur.010533475474.62]|Journal of Systems and Information Technology|2007|9|1|46-59|10.1108/13287260710817683|pub.1017910211|11;[van Dijk, Jan; Hacker, Kenneth]|[; ]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|315-326|10.1080/01972240309487|pub.1047421245|709;[Lucchetti, Riccardo; Sterlacchini, Alessandro]|[ur.010304043623.23; ur.010635612343.88]|Small Business Economics|2004|23|2|151-168|10.1023/b:sbej.0000027667.55821.53|pub.1053610764|130;[Chinn, M.

pub.1043619915,10.1016/j.giq.2008.11.004,Social welfare implications of the digital divide,"The Internet plays a critical role in informing individuals about society, politics, business, and the environment. So much so that it has been said that the digital divide makes the segment of society on the “right side” of the divide (the digitally endowed group) better off and that on the “wrong side” (the digitally challenged group) worse off. This is not always true, however, in a social choice situation where members of a society collectively choose one alternative from a set of alternatives. To identify conditions when this does not hold, a model of the digital divide is setup in which the digitally endowed group receives better information than the digitally challenged group. Preferences of all individuals over outcomes are distributed over a scale. This distribution is correlated with the digital divide: the outcome preferred by the digitally endowed group differs from that preferred by the other group. The alternative chosen by majority becomes the choice of the overall society. The ensuing analysis shows that individuals located centrally on the preference scale are sensitive to information about the state. The choice of centrally located digitally challenged individuals, made on a lack of information, makes the digitally challenged group worse off as has been predicted before. In some cases, the digitally endowed group is worse off as well. In the case of highly polar alternatives, social welfare decreases due to the welfare loss of the digitally endowed group. Results suggest that policymakers must manage the digital divide in a customized manner depending on the preferences context. They should not only focus on improving the welfare of the digitally challenged, but also focus on the welfare of the digitally endowed group so that this welfare does not decrease.",Government Information Quarterly,2009,26,2,377-386,"Kim, Eunjin; Lee, Byungtae; Menon, Nirup M.",Kyonggi University; George Mason University,South Korea; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043619915,15,"[Popkin, Samuel; Gorman, John W.; Phillips, Charles; Smith, Jeffrey A.]|[; ; ; ]|American Political Science Review|1976|70|3|779-805|10.1017/s0003055400174246|pub.1000287030|142;[FLORIDI, LUCIANO]|[ur.015031603611.12]|Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|2005|70|2|351-370|10.1111/j.1933-1592.2005.tb00531.x|pub.1000554956|197;[Katz, James; Aspden, Philip]|[ur.011125014303.05; ur.011004276717.53]|Internet Research|1997|7|3|170-188|10.1108/10662249710171814|pub.1002872177|179;[van Dijk, Jan A.G.M.]|[ur.016570250333.33]|Poetics|2006|34|4-5|221-235|10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004|pub.1014130665|741;[Anderson, Chris]|[ur.010717412472.00]|Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining  - KDD '07|2007|||1-1|10.1145/1281192.1281193|pub.1043222346|57;[Baye, Michael R.; Morgan, John; Scholten, Patrick]|[ur.010300426541.38; ur.016523117567.07; ur.010765175077.02]|Journal of Public Policy & Marketing|2003|22|1|17-25|10.1509/jppm.22.1.17.17625|pub.1043533189|68;[Miller, Arthur H.; Miller, Warren E.; Raine, Alden S.; Brown, Thad A.]|[ur.010140331155.17; ; ur.011533272155.52; ur.013723613555.78]|American Political Science Review|1976|70|3|753-778|10.2307/1959866|pub.1047917983|169;[Mansbridge, Jane J.]|[]|Public Opinion Quarterly|1985|49|2|164|10.1086/268912|pub.1058579523|47;[Hoffman, Donna L.; Novak, Thomas P.]|[ur.012265731146.27; ur.012777630633.16]|Science|1998|280|5362|390-391|10.1126/science.280.5362.390|pub.1062560768|271;[Howard, P.E.N.; Rainie, L.; Jones, S.]|[; ur.013223520340.72; ur.015414041740.33]|American Behavioral Scientist|2001|45|3|383-404|10.1177/00027640121957259|pub.1063544514|265;[Brynjolfsson, Erik; Smith, Michael D.]|[ur.016410366727.06; ur.013732004511.06]|Management Science|2000|46|4|563-585|10.1287/mnsc.46.4.563.12061|pub.1064721997|1561;[McKelvey, Richard D.; Ordeshook, Peter C.]|[ur.014751235221.14; ur.01005636660.22]|The Journal of Politics|1986|48|4|909-937|10.2307/2131005|pub.1069775053|121;[Barber, James D.; Campbell, Angus; Converse, Philip E.; Miller, Warren E.; Stokes, Donald E.]|[; ; ; ; ]|Political Science Quarterly|1960|75|4|593|10.2307/2145815|pub.1069785745|1077;[Simon, Herbert A.]|[ur.012376513231.97]|Economica|1957|24|96|382|10.2307/2550441|pub.1069986630|1173;[]|[]|Choice|2004|41|07|41-4342-41-4342|10.5860/choice.41-4342|pub.1073393330|99;[RIGGINS, FREDERICK J.]|[ur.013255447741.01]|Journal of Management Information Systems|2004|21|2|161-179|10.1080/07421222.2004.11045807|pub.1085538068|18;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|Society Online: The Internet in Context|2004|||257-274|10.4135/9781452229560.n16|pub.1088016939|36;[Baye, Michael R.; Morgan, John; Scholten, Patrick]|[ur.010300426541.38; ur.016523117567.07; ur.010765175077.02]|Handbooks in Information Systems|2006|1||323-375|10.1016/s1574-0145(06)01006-3|pub.1090145957|183;[Howard, Philip N.]|[ur.07755043743.48]||2005||||10.1017/cbo9780511615986|pub.1098708778|92;[Riggins, Frederick; Dewan, Sanjeev]|[; ]|Journal of the Association for Information Systems|2005|6|12|298-337|10.17705/1jais.00074|pub.1100731533|295;[Banfield, Edward C.; Downs, Anthony]|[; ]|American Journal of Political Science|1958|2|3|324|10.2307/2109186|pub.1102148841|1421"

Design/methodology/approach The article critically examines the Networked Readiness Index in terms of its presentation and its underlying model. It relies on an approach to policy analysis that views policy problems as socially constructed.   Findings E‐readiness assessment tools purport to show how ready the nations of the world are to exploit the potential of new information and communication technologies. Yet they do more than that; being actively engaged in constructing policy problems. In the case of the NRI, the problem of the international digital divide is defined in a particular way that privileges certain interests while at the same time legitimatizing its inclusion on the agenda of international organizations as a problem worthy of sustained attention.   Practical implications The findings of the article suggest a need for alternative indicators that register the voices of a wider range of groups and could therefore create a more inclusive digital divide policy problem.   Originality/value Little critical (as opposed to technical) analysis of e‐readiness indicators exits in the literature.

Correspondence courses using printed material and postal mail have been replaced by Web-based courses with the potential to make learning available to anyone, anywhere at anytime. This potential cannot be realized, however, unless two digital divides are eliminated. Some people are on the wrong side of the first “digital divide” between the technology “haves” and the technology “have-nots”. The benefits of technology are less available to those who are poor, who live in rural areas, who are members of minority racial or ethnic groups, and/or who have disabilities (Kaye, 2000; U.S. Department of Commerce, 1999). Lack of access to new technologies limits their options for taking and teaching technology-based courses. This is true for individuals with disabilities, even though the rapid development of assistive technology makes it possible for an individual with almost any type of disability to operate a computer (2003 Closing the Gap Resource Directory, 2003). Unfortunately, many people with disabilities still do not have access to these empowering tools, putting them on the “have not” side of the first digital divide.","Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, First Edition",2005,,,3079-3084,"Khosrow-Pour, Mehdi; Burgstahler, Sheryl",University of Washington,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041292375,2,
pub.1020795793,10.1145/2072069.2072076,The digital divide and e-government services,"There is much research examining the digital divide and what it looks like in society. This research often describes the digital divide as yet another symptom of the current socio-economic division in our society. Based on this research, one would expect that online government services targeting the lower income population would not become a policy focus. However, around the United States, programs are being adopted to provide e-government services to low-income populations who are receiving public welfare benefits. This raises a question as to whether this population can avail itself of e-government services and whether e-government services generally serve to create differences in government service provision between the wealthy and better educated compared to the poor and less educated. Our findings indicate that, as would be expected in the American context, there is a digital divide gap between these two populations. This gap begins with access to the Internet but also extends to the use of e-government services among those who have Internet access. We see that education and income are strong predictors of both the use of e-government services and the volume of e-government services used. This has implications for the expansion and use of e-government in the U.

pub.1095920341,10.28945/3247,ICT Adoption and the Digital Divide in Serbia: Factors and Policy Implications,"This paper explores factors such as socio-demographics, income and wealth and e-skills that may influence the adoption of the ICTs at the individual level. We examine to what extent these factors contribute to the digital divide between different social groups in Serbia. We use the panel data from the survey “ICT usage in Republic of Serbia” in 2006 and 2007, covering over 3000 individuals/households, to perform a quantitative analysis of the digital divide and ICT adoption. Based on a classification tree and a logistic regression model, a profile of the typical ICT adopter and non-adopter is identified. The empirical results show the following: (i) the digital divide between age group 55-74 and those younger that 55 slightly increased in 2007 in case of regular Internet use; (ii) at the individual level the ICT adoption (use of PC, Internet and mobile phones) in Serbia is mainly influenced by the income and wealth of an individual, its computer and Internet skills and age; (iii) this result is quite robust across the methodological approaches used; and (iv) the classification tree approach is preferable since it gives the same predictive accuracy as the logistic regression with a more parsimonious model. The policy implications of these results are discussed.",InSITE Conference,2008,,,,"Kovacic, Zlatko; Vukmirovic, Dragan",Open Polytechnic,New Zealand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095920341,5,

In the health, mental health, and disability sectors of society, technology helps provide access to previously unavailable information, communication, and services, allowing for greater independence, as well as 24/7 access to collaboration and support. The digital divide might prevent the people who will benefit the most from virtual services from accessing them. This chapter will explore systems of online health and mental healthcare, both formal and informal, the dependence on advanced networking technologies for these systems to be effective, and the impact of the digital divide on individuals’ access to online health and mental healthcare.

This paper examines the impact of critical mass and diffusion channels on the adoption of household computer applications. It proposes that critical mass is effective on the adoption of both general and specialized computer applications, and diffusions from channels of workplace and schools are significant. However, critical mass has stronger influence on general applications in early stage while exerts stronger impact on specialized applications in late stage of the diffusion process. In contrast, diffusions from workplace and schools are generally stronger in late stage rather than in early stage. Empirical results from a longitudinal study using Current Population Survey data confirm the propositions.

We show how the digital divide, where high-type consumers dominate the online channel and low-type consumers dominate the offline channel, artificially segments the marketplace, thereby mitigating the classic cannibalization problem. This allows the seller to more efficiently market its goods to each consumer segment. We show conditions under which low-type consumers are initially served in the offline channel, but subsequently bridging the divide results in their not being served in either channel. We also examine the implications of bridging the digital divide when the seller uses delay by engaging in intertemporal price discrimination.",Journal of Management Information Systems,2004,21,2,161-179,"RIGGINS, FREDERICK J.",University of Minnesota,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1085538068,18,"[Zettelmeyer, Florian]|[ur.010032255115.42]|Journal of Marketing Research|2000|37|3|292-308|10.1509/jmkr.37.3.292.18777|pub.1012842206|196;[Purohit, Devavrat]|[ur.014041566303.60]|Marketing Science|1997|16|3|228-245|10.1287/mksc.16.3.228|pub.1064713397|65;[Besanko, David; Winston, Wayne L.]|[ur.013272773271.49; ur.014070353671.73]|Management Science|1990|36|5|555-567|10.1287/mnsc.36.5.555|pub.1064720701|311;[Stokey, Nancy L.]|[]|The Quarterly Journal of Economics|1979|93|3|355|10.2307/1883163|pub.1069624658|379"

This chapter focuses on the role of these change agencies for technology diffusion and the elimination of the digital divide.

To explore the possibility of digital leapfrogging by an emerging region, this study looks at the three domains of hardware, software and connectivity. In each domain the default technology and its potential is evaluated as a digital inclusion tool while being juxtaposed with the latest “cutting-edge” alternative that could be used instead for “leapfrogging”. Three specific scenarios are developed in telephony, banking and the World Wide Web, which illustrate how a combination of these different technologies help emerging regions ‘leapfrog the digital divide.’ Finally, the paper suggests certain leapfrogging trajectories that ICT4D projects should explore.",International Journal of Information Communication Technologies and Human Development,2011,3,4,17-30,"Ranganathan, Kavitha",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038616302,1,"[STEINMUELLER, W.

Therefore, in recent years numerous attempts have been done to develop e-readiness and digital divide models oriented toward certain objectives. In this research, these models are investigated with view to their definitions and methodologies, and their strengths and weaknesses are identified. These findings can help researchers and policymakers select the models that fit in with their objectives as well as identify the defects of previous models and rectify them in their own models. Moreover, the extensive literature review led to an integrated model which is proposed to assess the e-readiness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Such a model can serve as a basis and standard for developing comprehensive models in SMEs.",International Journal of E-Adoption,2009,1,3,1-29,"Hanafizadeh, Mohammad Reza; Hanafizadeh, Payam; Saghaei, Abbas",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013392185,4,"[Hanafizadeh, Payam;

He suggests that in countries where the divide is falling, incomes will tend to be relatively high, and vice versa in the case of a rising divide. This relationship is examined on the basis of simple regression analysis; the analysis indicates the hypothesis is true with a high level of significance. Interpretation of the findings is carried out mainly in relation to countries from Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. In short, recent changes in the digital divide are associated with global inequality rather than equality, although there are some important anomalies that need to be explained.",The Information Society,2011,27,2,121-128,"James, Jeffrey",Tilburg University,Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025626810,30,"[James, Jeffrey]|[ur.07532230071.92]|Technological Forecasting and Social Change|2009|76|8|1124-1129|10.1016/j.techfore.2009.01.004|pub.1015849488|27;[James, Jeffrey]|[ur.07532230071.92]|Journal of Information Technology|2007|22|3|284-295|10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000097|pub.1023752621|46;[Singer, H.

pub.1095344936,10.1109/hicss.2004.1265496,A Multi-Channel Model of Separating Equilibrium in the Face of the Digital Divide,"We develop a multi-channel model of separating equilibrium where a seller markets a durable good to high and low type consumers in two different channels – an online Internet storefront and an offline brick-and-mortar store. We show how the digital divide, where high type consumers dominate the online channel and low type consumers dominate the offline channel, artificially segments the marketplace thereby mitigating the classic cannibalization problem. This allows the seller to more efficiently market its goods to each consumer segment. We show conditions under which low type consumers are initially served in the offline channel, but subsequently bridging the divide results in low type consumers not being served in either channel. We also examine the implications of bridging the digital divide when the seller uses delay by engaging in intertemporal price discrimination.","37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004.

Identifies some international initiatives to develop ICT infrastructure and proposes the development of telecenters, techmobiles and technology resource centers, and the use of the ‘old boy network' or ‘past students' associations’, to provide access to digital technology. Identifies the need to create Internet content in African languages, developing African language keyboards and conduct needs assessments of local users. Makes proposals for training teachers to teach information literacy skills, involving libraries in information literacy skills development and instituting mass information literacy programs.

This exploratory study aims to examine the relationships between demographic and situational variables and small and medium‐sized enterprise (SME) owners' intentions to adopt and use free public wifi technology.   Design/methodology/approach A survey study of 158 SME owners in the urban renewal community (RC) of a large Southwestern metroplex investigated the influence of known digital divisors – gender, ethnicity, age, education, and experience – on the adoption and use of wi‐fi technologies. Partial least squares was used to test the hypotheses.   Findings Contrary to previous research, gender, age, education, and experience were not related to the intention to adopt wifi technology. Ethnicity was significantly related to intent to adopt, but the relationship was small. Ethnicity and age were found to be somewhat related to wifi usage. In marked contrast from earlier research, education, gender, and experience were not significant predictors of usage.   Practical implications The findings suggest that access to high‐speed wifi has the potential to reduce and/or eliminate the digital divide. The projected changes in the digital divide can be expected to make a significant impact on SME productivity and performance.   Originality/value This study is one of the first to examine the influence of the adoption and use of public wi‐fi technologies by SME owners on the digital divide.",Information Technology and People,2010,23,1,4-22,"Middleton, Karen L.; Chambers, Valrie",Texas A&M University – Corpus Christi,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046494999,23,"[Zarrett, Nicole R.; Malanchuk, Oksana]|[ur.01233721757.61; ur.01205106365.18]|New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development|2005|2005|110|65-84|10.1002/cd.150|pub.1005405781|45;[Hudson, Heather E.]|[ur.0602611773.32]|Telematics and Informatics|2010|27|1|1-9|10.1016/j.tele.2009.01.002|pub.1005955011|24;[Burness, L; Higgins, D; Sago, A; Thorpe, P]|[ur.014571022564.39; ur.015366403164.41; ur.016163763564.37; ur.07460712364.57]|BT Technology Journal|2003|21|3|32-47|10.1023/a:1025150813389|pub.1007523955|10;[Grubesic, Tony H.]|[ur.01102232364.97]|Telecommunications Policy|2008|32|3-4|212-233|10.1016/j.telpol.2008.01.001|pub.1010170858|54;[Martin, Edward J.]|[]|International Journal of Public Administration|2007|30|1|77-93|10.1080/01900690601050120|pub.1010850704|3;[Schepers, Jeroen; Wetzels, Martin]|[ur.07535653125.99; ur.015634555333.05]|Information & Management|2007|44|1|90-103|10.1016/j.im.2006.10.007|pub.1017125929|878;[Lakhanpal, B.]|[ur.010543117511.72]|International Journal of Information Management|1994|14|1|39-50|10.1016/0268-4012(94)90094-9|pub.1017210210|12;[D, J.

pub.1005752507,10.1016/b978-155558290-6/50014-6,11 Principle Ten Support Efforts to Reduce the Digital Divide,"This chapter elucidates the tenth principle of socially responsible information technology management—supporting efforts to reduce the digital divide. There are myriad compelling reasons why information technology (IT) managers and companies that are dependent on IT should support efforts to decrease the digital divide. First and foremost, full participation in life in the information age requires computer literacy and Internet access. Computer-literate people are more likely to have an interest in IT-related careers, require less on-the-job training, contribute higher value to their employers, participate in e-government, and raise computer-literate children. The availability of applications such as electronic commerce, electronic payment, brokering services, and collaborative engineering to strengthen the relationships among manufacturers, suppliers, developers, and customers has grown rapidly. The potential convergence of wireless technology, television, and virtual reality is what the future has in store. As a result of the failure of so many e-commerce companies at the turn of the century, the momentum of the information age has stalled. E-business practices are becoming rather widely adopted in most industry. Actions that have been successful for many organizations to overcome the digital divide include contributing funds or equipment to local and regional programs and providing internships for local schools that have information technology programs.",Socially Responsible IT Management,2003,,,289-319,"Erbschloe, Michael",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005752507,0,

pub.1099624544,10.1002/j.1681-4835.2004.tb00114.x,Bridging the Digital Divide in Caribbean Group Decision‐Making,"Caribbean organizations, like their counterparts in developed countries, engage in countless group decision meetings that require structuring mechanisms to help produce effective outcomes. However, no such meeting support was available to the breakout sessions at the January 2003 meeting of The United Nations information and communication technologies (UNICT) task force to discuss the digital divide as it affects Caribbean community and common market (CARICOM) countries. Whereas group support systems (GSS) have been widely discussed in the literature, there is no evidence of their use in the English‐speaking Caribbean, a situation which may be classified as another instance of the digital divide. Against this backdrop, we examine the process of organizational decision‐making within groups, the factors influencing group behaviors and interaction and the advantages and disadvantages of structuring mechanisms such as the technology‐enabled GSS and the manual, nominal group technique (NGT). The paper concludes that it is desirable for Caribbean nations to acquire GSS technology to reap some of the benefits that other developing countries have experienced. However, despite its runner‐up status (to GSS), NGT provides similar assistance to that offered by GSS, is implementation‐friendly, inexpensive, and outperforms other manual techniques in creative decision‐making; it is therefore a viable alternative for Caribbean nations struggling to bridge the digital divide.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2004,17,1,1-23,"Duggan, Evan W.; Virtue, Grace",University of Alabama; Howard University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099624544,7,"[Duggan, Evan W.]|[ur.012443113223.52]|Human-Computer Interaction|2003|18|4|373-394|10.1207/s15327051hci1804_2|pub.1002429991|25;[Davidson, Robert; Qureshi, Sajda; de Vreede, Gert-Jan; Vogel, Doug; Jones, Noel]|[; ur.011420303741.26; ur.011536255313.17; ur.016344630467.67; ur.013160502672.59]|Journal of Global Information Technology Management|2000|3|4|6-23|10.1080/1097198x.2000.10856287|pub.1003278361|5;[Stephenson, Blair Y.; Michaelsen, Larry K.; Franklin, Stephen G.]|[ur.015025371017.79; ur.016020652351.05; ur.011506122551.13]|Group & Organization Management|1982|7|3|320-334|10.1177/105960118200700305|pub.1005123233|19;[Diehl, Michael; Stroebe, Wolfgang]|[ur.016641272725.83; ur.0742226061.13]|Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|1987|53|3|497-509|10.1037/0022-3514.53.3.497|pub.1013227758|1296;[Dennis, Alan R.; Hayes, Glenda S.; Daniels, Robert M.]|[; ; ]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1999|15|4|115-142|10.1080/07421222.1999.11518224|pub.1015374711|47;[Duggan, Evan W.; Thachenkary, Cherian S.]|[ur.012443113223.52; ur.016376666142.64]|Information Technology and Management|2003|4|4|391-408|10.1023/a:1025134318528|pub.1015836313|9;[Valacich, Joseph S.; Dennis, Alan R.; Connolly, Terry]|[ur.016415474467.72; ur.015000614017.19; ur.0617142567.25]|Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|1994|57|3|448-467|10.1006/obhd.1994.1024|pub.1017642109|292;[Briggs, Robert O.; Adkins, Mark; Mittleman, Daniel; Kruse, John; Miller, Scot; Nunamaker, Jay F.]|[ur.013202236033.60; ur.07760052521.78; ur.016024050275.32; ur.016646424535.90; ur.012441513042.38; ur.010273622745.50]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1998|15|3|151-195|10.1080/07421222.1998.11518217|pub.1018660597|106;[Tan, Bcy; Watson, Rt; Wei, Kwok-Kee]|[ur.014050127277.40; ur.012611725373.97; ur.0576031715.72]|European Journal of Information Systems|1995|4|2|82-92|10.1057/ejis.1995.10|pub.1018937490|47;[Ocker, Rosalie; Fjermestad, Jerry; Hiltz, Starr Roxanne; Johnson, Kenneth]|[ur.011032567505.18; ur.016340232435.37; ur.01076405404.90; ur.07752333033.35]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1998|15|1|99-118|10.1080/07421222.1998.11518198|pub.1019100754|71;[Liou, Yihwa Irene; Chen, Minder]|[ur.016052211653.58; ur.012610220505.45]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1993|10|3|25-41|10.1080/07421222.1993.11518009|pub.1020940131|30;[Niederman, Fred]|[ur.07427570367.08]|Journal of Global Information Management|1997|5|1|17-26|10.4018/jgim.1997010102|pub.1021970712|7;[Caouette, Margaretta J.; O'Connor, Bridget N.]|[ur.015230451771.62; ur.016623412771.44]|Journal of Organizational Computing and Electronic Commerce|1998|8|1|57-81|10.1207/s15327744joce0801_3|pub.1023053830|8;[Valacich, Joseph S.; Schwenk, Charles]|[ur.016415474467.72; ur.013603507741.04]|Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|1995|63|2|158-173|10.1006/obhd.1995.1070|pub.1023623453|90;[Bartunek, Jean M.; Murninghan, J.

This paper shows that the divide looks differently from what was previously thought for the fastest-growing developing countries—Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) based on 2006 data. While mobile technology depth (number subscriptions as percentage of population) is lower in BRIC, it has been rapidly growing, equaling, or surpassing some developed countries for BRIC such as Russia and Brazil. BRIC such as India and Russia also equal or surpass several developed countries in 2006 in terms of mobile technology breadth (service variety) on 34 individual and five categories of mobile services available worldwide. While some BRIC may be behind developed countries on one of these dimensions in 2006, they are ahead on the other dimension. Thus, the digital divide between BRIC and developed countries can be narrower, absent, or even reversed, depending on the metric used. This paper argues that BRIC can serve as frontrunners whose lessons on technology diffusion can be applied in other developing countries. The paper presents implications for new product and innovation management and digital divide research and for policy making and business processes for high-tech companies in BRIC and other developing countries.",Journal of Product Innovation Management,2009,26,4,455-466,"Chircu, Alina M.; Mahajan, Vijay",Bentley University; The University of Texas at Austin,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050058172,32,"[Guo, Liang]|[]|Journal of Product Innovation Management|2008|25|3|249-260|10.1111/j.1540-5885.2008.00298.x|pub.1008619254|43;[Burgess, Steven Michael; Steenkamp, Jan-Benedict E.M.]|[ur.0625536123.50; ur.011266314527.08]|International Journal of Research in Marketing|2006|23|4|337-356|10.1016/j.ijresmar.2006.08.001|pub.1014411046|562;[Mariscal, Judith]|[ur.07365701451.47]|Telecommunications Policy|2005|29|5-6|409-428|10.1016/j.telpol.2005.03.004|pub.1015198978|80;[Rouvinen, Petri]|[ur.016373600033.92]|Telecommunications Policy|2006|30|1|46-63|10.1016/j.telpol.2005.06.014|pub.1021398457|142;[Dekimpe, Marnik G.; Parker, Philip M.; Sarvary, Miklos]|[ur.012747052606.79; ur.011013173737.89; ur.013626656605.39]|Technological Forecasting and Social Change|1998|57|1-2|105-132|10.1016/s0040-1625(97)00085-1|pub.1029529433|125;[Dekimpe, Marnik G.; Parker, Philip M.; Sarvary, Miklos]|[ur.012747052606.79; ur.011013173737.89; ur.013626656605.39]|Technological Forecasting and Social Change|2000|63|1|25-42|10.1016/s0040-1625(99)00086-4|pub.1030054886|68;[Boretos, George P.]|[ur.014723245463.11]|Technological Forecasting and Social Change|2007|74|3|331-340|10.1016/j.techfore.2005.11.005|pub.1040370997|43;[Ram, S.; Jung, Hyung-Shik]|[ur.014302002710.30; ur.014462115641.10]|Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science|1990|18|1|67-76|10.1007/bf02729763|pub.1046324044|48;[Zhang, Xiaoni; Prybutok, Victor R.]|[ur.012310155577.80; ur.015307217435.54]|Communications of the ACM|2005|48|3|111-114|10.1145/1047671.1047678|pub.1053727311|43;[Galperin, Hernan]|[ur.010322365021.09]|Information Technologies and International Development|2005|2|3|47-56|10.1162/1544752054782420|pub.1063350551|53;[Hauser, John; Tellis, Gerard J.; Griffin, Abbie]|[; ur.07546061031.08; ]|Marketing Science|2006|25|6|687-717|10.1287/mksc.1050.0144|pub.1064712648|728;[Kumar, V.; Krishnan, Trichy V.]|[ur.011400636367.68; ur.011301740142.49]|Marketing Science|2002|21|3|318-330|10.1287/mksc.21.3.318.139|pub.1064713814|101;[]|[]|Choice|2006|43|11|43-6649-43-6649|10.5860/choice.43-6649|pub.1073410693|650;[Kraemer, Kenneth; Ganley, Dale; Dewan, Sanjeev]|[ur.01003675072.26; ur.015537307210.47; ur.014741726610.51]|Journal of the Association for Information Systems|2005|6|12|409-432|10.17705/1jais.00071|pub.1100731530|99;[Techatassanasoontorn, Angsana; Kauffman, Robert]|[ur.015770503245.26; ur.015720352041.76]|Journal of the Association for Information Systems|2005|6|12|338-382|10.17705/1jais.00073|pub.1100731532|57;[Riggins, Frederick; Dewan, Sanjeev]|[; ]|Journal of the Association for Information Systems|2005|6|12|298-337|10.17705/1jais.00074|pub.1100731533|295;[Crenshaw, Edward; Robison, Kristopher]|[ur.013127613411.61; ur.015334225726.82]|Journal of the Association for Information Systems|2006|7|1|4-18|10.17705/1jais.00078|pub.1100760199|11"

The computers and internet connections are available almost at every part ofMalaysia including those in the remote areas. However; to have a real impact of technology on people slives, the effort has to go beyond the infrastructures and technology literacy programs and awareness. Having information available suit to the needs of the local community will bring greater impact ofthe technology to them. Nevertheless, the new approaches need to be introduced to make the effort less costly. Some of the Digital Divide programs require proper coordination with other projects. Coordination with the responsible agencies in providing power utilities and road infrastructures is essential to make such expensive digital divide program more cost effective·and give greater impact to the community. Thus, this paper will provide numerous suggestions on the improvement in providing greater benefits; both the users and the project implementers. Besides, this paper will also discuss on the need of local content in local language with self-sustained nature. lt further highlights the importanceof having basic infrastructure such as electricity and road accessibility that may have influence over the success of BDD program.",Social and Management Research Journal,2010,7,1,23,"Hassan, Roshidi; Megat Tajuddin, Megat Zuhairy",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113633100,0,

pub.1039584655,10.1080/15228053.2010.10856195,Digital Divide And Equity In Education: A Rawlsian Analysis,"In his magnum opus, ""A Theory of Justice"" (1971), John Rawls, one of the most influential American philosophers of the twentieth century, emphasizes two principles of justice, one that ensures equal liberties and the second equal opportunity for all irrespective of their status. The most important part of the second principle known as the ""difference principle"" addresses social inequity by recommending institutional support for the under-privileged segment of the society. These principles of justice serve as guidelines for political institutions to ensure equality of basic political and civil rights and equity in the social and economic conditions. To facilitate equity, Rawls places significant emphasis on the formal notion of ""justice"" over its substantive notion which is ""fairness. "" If fairness could be achieved in the process of institutionalising justice in any socio-political system then it would reach the position of ""reflective equilibrium "" which is an ideal condition for any just system. This paper would attempt to apply the Rawlsian principles of justice in the context of the emerging inequitable situation in the education sector and web based education in India. The emerging issue of ""digital divide"" widens the disparity among the society in education and economic sectors. The burgeoning fields of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and the scope of ICT in education at various levels create a complex situation, when resources and opportunities remain inaccessible to the poor. Inequity due to digital divide assumes significance and requires urgent attention of the policy makers, administrators and community as the Indian government has been actively implementing massive schemes in education and rural development, to ensure accessibility, availability and affordability of education and economic opportunities to all citizens of the country. The paper analyses how accessibility to web based learning enhances opportunities for the educated sector and its inaccessibility implies ""injustice"" to the deprived sector of the society. The efforts of the government to bridge the digital divide could lead to a rapid improvement in the social, political and economic conditions of the poor and underprivileged strata in India. In this paper, the efforts of the Indian government to bridge the digital divide are highlighted and effective measures to tackle inequity due to the digital divide are suggested.",Journal of Information Technology Case and Application Research,2010,12,4,37-62,"Anthony, Josephine; Padmanabhan, Sudarsan",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039584655,2,"[Freeman, Samuel]|[]||2007||||10.4324/9780203086605|pub.1052371935|448;[]|[]||2006||||10.4018/978-1-59140-732-4|pub.1096031224|36;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]||2001||||10.1017/cbo9781139164887|pub.1098663486|2054;[]|[]|A Theory of Justice, Revised Edition|1999||||10.4159/9780674042582|pub.1144910175|2493"

Age and the digital divide,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the literature on age and the digital divide by examining the uses of and attitudes toward information and communication technologies (ICTs) by 26 politically senior citizens.   Design/methodology/approach The approach taken involved in‐depth face‐to‐face interviews.   Findings The majority of the respondents are informed and balanced cyber‐enthusiasts who have embraced the opportunities afforded by ICTs to enhance their lives in general, including their political activities.   Originality/value These findings destabilize the dominant image of older people and their attitudes to and experiences of ICTs that appears in most of the literature on age and the digital divide. Those aged 65 and over represent the last cohort, in Western societies at least, for whom age as such is likely to be a decisive factor in their relationship to ICTs. It is therefore vital to get some insight into their views.",Journal of Information Communication and Ethics in Society,2009,7,4,225-242,"Abbey, Ruth; Hyde, Sarah",University of Notre Dame; University of Kent,United States; United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028711396,23,"[LOGES, WILLIAM E.; JUNG, JOO-YOUNG]|[ur.01001671405.59; ]|Communication Research|2001|28|4|536-562|10.1177/009365001028004007|pub.1000388613|234;[Ward, Stephen; Gibson, Rachel]|[ur.011454202035.31; ur.0714731040.20]|The British Journal of Politics and International Relations|2003|5|2|188-205|10.1111/1467-856x.00103|pub.1004454024|81;[Chen, Wenhong; Boase, Jeffrey; Wellman, Barry]|[ur.010334265342.93; ur.01023052656.15; ur.011001756750.07]|The Internet in Everyday Life|2002|||74-113|10.1002/9780470774298.ch2|pub.1004780025|72;[Anderson, Ben; Tracey, Karina]|[ur.01310332460.24; ]|The Internet in Everyday Life|2002|||139-163|10.1002/9780470774298.ch4|pub.1024582768|72;[Weber, Lori M.; Loumakis, Alysha; Bergman, James]|[; ; ]|Social Science Computer Review|2003|21|1|26-42|10.1177/0894439302238969|pub.1027714579|184;[Matei, Sorin; Ball‐Rokeach, Sandra J.]|[ur.013075040044.77; ur.014002173501.16]|The Internet in Everyday Life|2002|||404-427|10.1002/9780470774298.ch14|pub.1032828926|39;[Shelley, Mack C.; Thrane, Lisa E.; Shulman, Stuart W.]|[ur.01267601700.10; ur.01277414401.35; ur.01111650500.36]|International Journal of Electronic Government Research|2006|2|1|36-53|10.4018/jegr.2006010103|pub.1033251861|12;[Katz, James E.; Rice, Ronald E.]|[; ]|The Internet in Everyday Life|2002|||114-138|10.1002/9780470774298.ch3|pub.1035480136|40;[Gibson, R.

The path analysis suggests four main findings. First, socio-demographic conditions strongly matter for e-government use. Younger generations and socioeconomically advantaged people use e-government more than their counterparts. Second, perceived usefulness of e-government contributes to actual use of e-government. Third, the effect of trust in government on e-government adoption is indirect through perceived usefulness rather than directly causal. Those with higher levels of trust in overall government would likely perceive value of e-government, and then those who perceive potential benefits from using e-government adopt e-government.

pub.1020913051,10.1007/s10290-009-0045-y,Differences in digitalization levels: a multivariate analysis studying the global digital divide,"This papers aims to identify and explain the differences in information and communications technologies (ICT) adoption for a sample of 142 developed and developing countries. In addition, we examine the relationships between specific combinations of technologies and the factors explaining them. Although income is a key factor for all country groups, its role is more significant for middle-digitalization countries. Using several multivariate techniques, we detect different patterns of digitalization. The patterns are explained to differing degrees by the type of country, by differences in economic development, and by socio-demographic and institutional variables.

The results reveal that there is a wide digital divide among the college students of Kashmir. The data shows that male students use the Internet more than females, and urban more than their rural counterparts. Among the different faculties, the students of computer science make use of the Internet most of all and social sciences and humanities students the least. The students who do not use the Internet state many reasons like the lack of Internet facilities in colleges, homes and localities, lack of access, lack of training, lack of awareness, lack of interest, no need, external threat and many others.

Policy makers worldwide clearly declare that the main aim of their technology diffusion strategies is the elimination of the gap between ‘haves‘ and ‘have-nots’ in the cyberspace. In this paper we extent previous research on the application of the stakeholder analysis in electronic commerce policy making [1] by focusing on its normative aspect. According to this aspect it is ethically appropriate for policy makers to consider all stakeholders, which are relevant to their strategies. We argue that the need to consider the widest spectrum of stakeholders in the implementation of electronic commerce policies may lead to a fair strategy towards the elimination of the digital divide.","36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2003.

Design/methodology/approach The paper was designed using and combining objective data and literature, adding the author's personal experiences and opinions.   Findings After 1 May 2004, when the EU was enlarged from 15 to 25 member states, the digital divide in the EU widened substantially (national connectivity varying from less than 10 to more than 60 per cent), caused by regional lack of technological infrastructure as well as cultural and psychological factors.   Research limitations/implications Many “most recent” national data on internet‐connectivity are two years old.   Practical implications Inequality in internet‐connectivity in the EU will increase dramatically, with all consequences for communication, dissemination of information, economy (e‐commerce!), etc. Consequently, parallel to digital media, traditional means of dissemination of information – such as printed books, public libraries, local broadcasting – should be maintained and furthered.",New Library World,2005,106,3/4,164-172,"Hubregtse, Sjaak",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1053626666,13,

Two main and interrelated strands of evidence are presented: First, contrary to expectations that rising income per capita will tend to reduce wealth and wage disparities, the distribution of income and wealth both between countries and individuals has sharply skewed in the information age; second, knowledge production is a self-reinforcing cycle that tends to disproportionately reward some and exclude others. The so-called digital divide is as much a symptom and a cause of these broader techno-economic phenomena, and regarding it as a simple issue of connectivity is simplistic and reductive.",The Information Society,2005,21,1,41-51,"Parayil, Govindan",University of Oslo,Norway,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1044826487,71,"[James, Jeffrey]|[]|Review of International Political Economy|2001|8|1|147-162|10.1080/09692290010010281|pub.1002273570|13;[Ahluwalia, Montek S.]|[ur.014133412511.72]|Journal of Development Economics|1976|3|4|307-342|10.1016/0304-3878(76)90027-4|pub.1005846482|380;[Wolff, Edward N.]|[ur.014040432267.06]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|233-251|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00068-3|pub.1007566875|7;[Drahos, Peter]|[]|The Information Society|1995|11|3|209-222|10.1080/01972243.1995.9960193|pub.1019284091|15;[de la Mothe, John]|[ur.011347363310.13]|Technology in Society|2004|26|2-3|523-536|10.1016/j.techsoc.2004.01.009|pub.1027532638|20;[Antonelli, Cristiano]|[ur.016105373552.67]|Information Economics and Policy|2003|15|2|173-199|10.1016/s0167-6245(02)00093-8|pub.1030504131|63;[Lucas, Henry; Sylla, Richard]|[; ]|Prometheus|2003|21|1|1-22|10.1080/0810902032000050983|pub.1035384846|21;[Maddison, Angus]|[]|Development Centre Studies|2003||||10.1787/9789264104143-en|pub.1036559034|922;[Sutcliffe, B.]|[]|Oxford Review of Economic Policy|2004|20|1|15-37|10.1093/oxrep/grh002|pub.1059967359|75;[Piketty, T.; Saez, E.]|[ur.010004477566.68; ur.016146700245.30]|The Quarterly Journal of Economics|2003|118|1|1-41|10.1162/00335530360535135|pub.1063348942|1998;[Autor, David H.; Katz, Lawrence F.; Krueger, Alan B.]|[ur.011241342041.35; ur.01165352155.05; ur.0655705467.19]|The Quarterly Journal of Economics|1998|113|4|1169-1213|10.1162/003355398555874|pub.1063349115|1171;[Berman, Eli; Bound, John; Machin, Stephen]|[; ur.01131520521.49; ur.01250235220.68]|The Quarterly Journal of Economics|1998|113|4|1245-1279|10.1162/003355398555892|pub.1063349117|714;[Stiroh, Kevin J]|[ur.012362462064.30]|American Economic Review|2002|92|5|1559-1576|10.1257/000282802762024638|pub.1064524008|428;[Caselli, Francesco]|[]|American Economic Review|1999|89|1|78-102|10.1257/aer.89.1.78|pub.1064526794|325;[Wood, Adrian]|[]|Journal of Economic Perspectives|1995|9|3|57-80|10.1257/jep.9.3.57|pub.1064531316|456;[Berman, E.; Bound, J.; Griliches, Z.]|[; ur.015252354520.70; ur.01147673254.12]|The Quarterly Journal of Economics|1994|109|2|367-397|10.2307/2118467|pub.1069768965|1065;[Krueger, A.

pub.1011613866,10.1007/s10209-004-0103-0,The geography of the digital divide: broadband deployment in the Community of Madrid,"Realising the potential of the information society requires an adequate broadband infrastructure, a sine qua non condition for usage. The different deployment rhythms of broadband networks threaten to increase the distance separating developed and developing countries. However, inside developed countries, separating lines are also being traced on regional or local scales. The magnitude and characteristics of this second form of geographic digital divide are not thoroughly known. This article provides this analysis for a specific case, namely the Community of Madrid. We conclude that outside the metropolitan areas, adapting existing infrastructures, instead of deploying new networks, is the actual base for expanding broadband accessibility. However, it seems certain that the deployment is quite far from being universal, at least in the medium term. Population size seems to be the most relevant criterion for identifying “threatened” areas.",Universal Access in the Information Society,2004,3,3-4,264-271,"Gómez Barroso, José Luis; Pérez Martínez, Jorge",National University of Distance Education; Technical University of Madrid,Spain; Spain,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1011613866,7,

One of the main achievements of the project is to share and transfer technology and knowledge, with the aim of reducing the existing barriers for digital inclusion. ODISEAME is an intercultural and multilingual project, which is focused on the application of Information and Communication Technologies to the learning process in the context of University Education. The article firstly examines the barriers of digital inclusion: cost of infrastructure and lack of contents in the mother tongue.

Based on previous validated studies, the researchers offered a new theoretical model in examining the influences of the two mediating factors – Internet self-efficacy and outcome expectations – on the elderly's intentions in adopting a new technology (i.e. the Internet), and their perceptions of their knowledge in utilizing this technology. The elderly are categorized as one of the technologically and sociologically disadvantaged groups within the context of the digital divide. Two studies (repeated measures) were conducted and a set of conclusions was reached. In general, the findings validated the impacts and antecedents of Internet self-efficacy and outcome expectations on usage intention and perceived user competence. Limitations and implications are provided following the sections on research framework, model and hypotheses, and discussion on findings.",Proceedings of the 38th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,2005,,,1-10,"Lam, Jolie; Lee, Matthew",City University of Hong Kong,China,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094614164,25,"[Martocchio, Joseph J.]|[ur.016271117777.31]|Journal of Applied Psychology|1994|79|6|819-825|10.1037/0021-9010.79.6.819|pub.1001998141|219;[Gist, Marilyn E.; Schwoerer, Catherine; Rosen, Benson]|[ur.011475515721.28; ur.015534431600.33; ur.010767421143.36]|Journal of Applied Psychology|1989|74|6|884-891|10.1037/0021-9010.74.6.884|pub.1005203359|551;[Bandura, Albert]|[ur.01227557742.29]|Advances in Behaviour Research and Therapy|1978|1|4|237-269|10.1016/0146-6402(78)90012-7|pub.1013922855|315;[Bolton, Elizabeth B.]|[]|Educational Gerontology|1978|3|4|331-344|10.1080/0360127780030403|pub.1015768720|10;[Ajzen, Icek]|[ur.011652717561.39]|Springer Series in Social Psychology|1985|||11-39|10.1007/978-3-642-69746-3_2|pub.1019346517|9400;[Igbaria, M.; Iivari, J.]|[ur.01014261436.52; ur.016251272265.74]|Omega|1995|23|6|587-605|10.1016/0305-0483(95)00035-6|pub.1026019546|543;[Schunk, Dale H.]|[ur.07371047063.15]|Journal of Educational Psychology|1981|73|1|93-105|10.1037/0022-0663.73.1.93|pub.1029068938|395;[Manz, Charles C.; Sims, Henry P.]|[ur.014107312071.85; ur.013460225536.80]|Journal of Applied Psychology|1986|71|4|571-578|10.1037/0021-9010.71.4.571|pub.1029681987|32;[Munro, Malcolm C.; Huff, Sid L.; Marcolin, Barbara L.; Compeau, Deborah R.]|[ur.01352221756.84; ur.015150555467.44; ur.0575402522.55; ur.07600141101.06]|Information & Management|1997|33|1|45-57|10.1016/s0378-7206(97)00035-9|pub.1032509713|92;[Igbaria, Magid; Pavri, Francis N.; Huff, Sid L.]|[ur.01014261436.52; ur.010271304637.84; ur.015150555467.44]|Information & Management|1989|16|4|187-196|10.1016/0378-7206(89)90036-0|pub.1034716998|166;[Betz, Nancy E.; Hackett, Gail]|[ur.011760774535.25; ur.010753024313.54]|Journal of Counseling Psychology|1981|28|5|399-410|10.1037/0022-0167.28.5.399|pub.1034938734|745;[Frayne, Colette A.; Latham, Gary P.]|[ur.016267635014.10; ur.013157145317.17]|Journal of Applied Psychology|1987|72|3|387-392|10.1037/0021-9010.72.3.387|pub.1035464520|291;[Bandura, Albert; Adams, Nancy E.]|[ur.01227557742.29; ur.015116717430.39]|Cognitive Therapy and Research|1977|1|4|287-310|10.1007/bf01663995|pub.1035881496|797;[GIST, MARILYN; ROSEN, BENSON; SCHWOERER, CATHERINE]|[ur.011475515721.28; ur.010767421143.36; ur.015534431600.33]|Personnel Psychology|1988|41|2|255-265|10.1111/j.1744-6570.1988.tb02384.x|pub.1037451154|133;[Hill, Thomas; Smith, Nancy D.; Mann, Millard F.]|[ur.01342240562.55; ur.010032632577.03; ur.010733006555.19]|Journal of Applied Psychology|1987|72|2|307-313|10.1037/0021-9010.72.2.307|pub.1044238905|436;[Latham, Gary P.; Saari, Lise M.]|[ur.013157145317.17; ur.011354035546.16]|Journal of Applied Psychology|1979|64|3|239-246|10.1037/0021-9010.64.3.239|pub.1045485717|257;[Eastin, Matthew S.; LaRose, Robert]|[ur.0737056724.32; ur.0634303551.63]|Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|2006|6|1|0-0|10.1111/j.1083-6101.2000.tb00110.x|pub.1061923606|604;[Marcolin, Barbara L.; Compeau, Deborah R.; Munro, Malcolm C.; Huff, Sid L.]|[ur.0575402522.55; ur.07600141101.06; ur.01352221756.84; ur.015150555467.44]|Information Systems Research|2000|11|1|37-60|10.1287/isre.11.1.37.11782|pub.1064711414|114;[Compeau, Deborah R.; Higgins, Christopher A.]|[ur.07600141101.06; ur.014370362035.54]|Information Systems Research|1995|6|2|118-143|10.1287/isre.6.2.118|pub.1064711981|763;[Taylor, Shirley; Todd, Peter A.]|[; ]|Information Systems Research|1995|6|2|144-176|10.1287/isre.6.2.144|pub.1064711982|4357;[Davis, Fred D.; Bagozzi, Richard P.; Warshaw, Paul R.]|[ur.014060724401.60; ur.0712073700.63; ur.015250026703.09]|Management Science|1989|35|8|982-1003|10.1287/mnsc.35.8.982|pub.1064720609|12149;[Burkhardt, Marlene E.; Brass, Daniel J.]|[ur.011214630066.42; ur.01124300544.27]|Administrative Science Quarterly|1990|35|1|104|10.2307/2393552|pub.1069908816|592;[Deshpande, Rohit; Brown, Lawrence A.; Rogers, Everett M.; Sahal, Devendra]|[; ; ; ur.012076047520.14]|Journal of Marketing Research|1983|20|3|327|10.2307/3151838|pub.1070214089|1238;[Triandis, H C]|[ur.047266443.28]|Nebraska Symposium on Motivation.

A wide variety of approaches have been undertaken to address these issues, both to enable individuals to cross the ‘digital divide’ and also to enhance community interactions. In this paper, we focus on one approach–grassroots networked communities. These are communities of locality that have developed their own computer network infrastructure with minimal external support. We analyse eight examples from the UK and present survey results, identifying key characteristics and modes of operation. We argue that such initiatives may offer a viable method of overcoming multiple digital insufficiencies and ensure sustainable and meaningful ICT usage.

pub.1006303895,10.4018/978-1-60566-699-0.ch013,Does the Digital Divide Extend to Minority- and Women-Owned Small Businesses?,"This chapter examines whether the digital divide in the United States extends to computer use in small businesses. The analysis is based on a 2003 telephone survey of 1,123 firms with fewer than 50 employees and at least one computer, and in-depth interviews with 45 business owners. The analysis provides no evidence of a business digital divide across racial, ethnic, and gender groups. In fact, firms owned by African-American males show more intensive computer use than white male-owned firms, even after controlling for firm and owner characteristics. We do, however, find links between the intensity of computer use and firm and owner characteristics, such as firm size, market reach, intensity of computer use in the relevant industry, and age of owner. Finally, the in-depth interviews suggest that businesses with effective computer use depend upon the technical expertise of the business owners or people in their social networks.",Handbook of Research on Overcoming Digital Divides,2010,,,239-259,"Ferro, Enrico; Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Gil-Garcia, J.

However, these progressive steps are yet to reach millions of disabled persons in rural Bangladesh. Around 13 million people in Bangladesh are physically handicapped of which 3 million are children. Disability is increasing with population growth and ageing. Disability on this scale represents not only a major health issue but also a prime cause of poverty and underdevelopment. Information and Communication Technology (ICT), opens up great opportunities to improve the quality of life of disabled people failing which will further the digital divide. This paper proposes to discuss the importance of ICT development and accessibility for persons with disabilities in Bangladesh and elaborate on how ICT has been utilized thus far and how we can further these initiatives towards development.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2010,6179,,527-530,"Hossain, Mahjabeen Khaled",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001521453,5,

Previous studies have conducted surveys about using computers and the internet instead of measuring the digital divide by using multilateral approaches; however, this study examines digital divide in terms of motivation, opportunity, and ability. Results suggested age, gender, and education level influenced motivation, opportunity, and ability in the use of the internet by consumers; in addition, the motivation and ability were different depending on occupation. The results show that the digital divide was mainly influenced by motivation and ability in offering a difference between the two groups of young and aging consumers, This study contributes to illuminate the differences between young and aging consumers to use the internet and to suggest implications in the perspectives of motivation, opportunity, and ability.",International journal of human ecology,2011,12,1,65-73,"Nam, Su-Jung; Kim, Ju-Ran",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028457840,0,"[Sun, Shaojing; Rubin, Alan M.; Haridakis, Paul M.]|[ur.013713526065.37; ur.015765646631.50; ur.010060156031.86]|Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media|2008|52|3|408-431|10.1080/08838150802205595|pub.1004538741|75;[Wright, Peter]|[]|Journal of Applied Psychology|1974|59|5|555-561|10.1037/h0037186|pub.1005557108|532;[Graham, Stephen]|[]|Urban Studies|2002|39|1|33-56|10.1080/00420980220099050|pub.1010968716|244;[Rubin, Alan M.]|[ur.015765646631.50]|Journal of Communication|1984|34|3|67-77|10.1111/j.1460-2466.1984.tb02174.x|pub.1014770521|453;[Wilson, Kenneth R.; Wallin, Jennifer S.; Reiser, Christa]|[; ; ]|Social Science Computer Review|2003|21|2|133-143|10.1177/0894439303021002001|pub.1015934109|133;[Huang, Jie; Russell, Susan]|[; ]|The Electronic Library|2006|24|2|160-173|10.1108/02640470610660350|pub.1021724615|27;[GION, CHRIS]|[]|Australian Geographer|2003|34|2|239-257|10.1080/00049180301734|pub.1023279441|25;[Whaley, Kermit C.]|[]|Journal of Medical Systems|2004|28|2|183-195|10.1023/b:joms.0000023301.09308.d9|pub.1026345655|19;[Ahmed, Allam]|[ur.015557641163.67]|Information Technology for Development|2007|13|4|337-361|10.1002/itdj.20067|pub.1026676526|32;[]|[]|Technological Learning|2004||||10.4337/9781845426910|pub.1027347799|19;[Cawkell, Tony]|[ur.013074276503.15]|Journal of Information Science|2001|27|1|55-60|10.1177/016555150102700107|pub.1032639953|21;[Rice, Ronald E; Katz, James E]|[ur.014077537323.51; ur.016135056233.08]|Telecommunications Policy|2003|27|8-9|597-623|10.1016/s0308-5961(03)00068-5|pub.1036982710|364;[Leung, Louis; Wei, Ran]|[; ]|Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly|2000|77|2|308-320|10.1177/107769900007700206|pub.1037567734|538;[Petty, Richard E.; Wells, Gary L.; Brock, Timothy C.]|[ur.01273163701.77; ur.01025501575.87; ur.0636736146.21]|Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|1976|34|5|874-884|10.1037/0022-3514.34.5.874|pub.1046719701|476;[Peters, Oscar; Allouch, Somaya ben]|[ur.07703413571.06; ur.014174722665.59]|Telematics and Informatics|2005|22|3|239-256|10.1016/j.tele.2004.11.002|pub.1047954256|60;[Hubregtse, Sjaak]|[]|New Library World|2005|106|3/4|164-172|10.1108/03074800510587363|pub.1053626666|13;[Moorman, Christine]|[]|Journal of Consumer Research|1990|17|3|362|10.1086/208563|pub.1058528150|257;[Burnkrant, Robert E.]|[ur.014722536575.35]|Journal of Consumer Research|1976|3|1|21|10.1086/208647|pub.1058528234|49;[Celsi, Richard L.; Olson, Jerry C.]|[ur.011303014221.89; ur.014270716221.10]|Journal of Consumer Research|1988|15|2|210|10.1086/209158|pub.1058528745|1291;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]|Info|2003|5|1|77-78|10.1108/146366903322008287|pub.1061015345|74;[Birla, Kumar Mangalam]|[]|International Journal of Learning and Intellectual Capital|2005|2|4|321|10.1504/ijlic.2005.008088|pub.1067469054|3;[Ahmed, Allam]|[ur.015557641163.67]|International Journal of Technology Policy and Management|2004|4|1|1|10.1504/ijtpm.2004.004563|pub.1067500426|11;[MacInnis, Deborah J.; Moorman, Christine; Jaworski, Bernard J.]|[ur.013443225551.19; ur.016065665717.97; ur.012323224703.79]|Journal of Marketing|1991|55|4|32|10.2307/1251955|pub.1069417553|681"
pub.1003863779,10.1002/asi.21470,The Rawls‐Tawney theorem and the digital divide in postindustrial society,"The digital divide continues to challenge political and academic circles worldwide. A range of policy solutions is briefly evaluated, from laissez-faire on the right to “arithmetic” egalitarianism on the left. The article recasts the digital divide as a problem for the social distribution of presumptively important information (e.g., electoral data, news, science) within postindustrial society. Endorsing in general terms the left-liberal approach of differential or “geometric” egalitarianism, it seeks to invest this with greater precision, and therefore utility, by means of a possibly original synthesis of the ideas of John Rawls and R. H. Tawney. It is argued that, once certain categories of information are accorded the status of “primary goods,” their distribution must then comply with principles of justice as articulated by those major 20th century exponents of ethical social democracy.

The author finds that there is tremendous variation as to how often state legislators use the Internet to gather policy information. The author did not find evidence of a digital divide as it pertains to urbanism, or gender. It appears that a digital divide remains, however, between young and old legislators—with younger legislators using the Internet more often— and legislators in California versus legislators in Georgia and Iowa. In the end, it appears that the digital divide in the state legislature is shrinking.

pub.1043473326,10.1002/jsc.694,An evaluation of conventional wisdom of the factors underlying the digital divide: a case study of the Isle of Man,"The digital divide is defined as the gap that exists between those with and those without access to the Internet. Conventional wisdom is represented by the technology optimists' view that the divide is caused by societal barriers to Internet connectivity such as low levels of education, income and proliferation of technology. The technology pessimists disagree that these barriers cause the divide or that they are important enough to justify significant expenditure by government. This paper reports on a study to evaluate the validity of the optimistic position. The Isle of Man (IOM) was selected for this evaluation because of its size, social stability, high levels of education and income and established e-government programme. The premise of the research was that if the optimistic view is correct, lower or similar barriers to those found in the UK should result in higher or similar levels of Internet access in the IOM. Prime causal factors of the digital divide, as purported by the optimists, were found to marginally favour the IOM. However, the test of Internet access revealed that the IOM trailed the UK connectivity level by some 12% to 14%, which is not as expected from the optimistic viewpoint. This unexpected outcome could constitute a dilemma for the IOM government in adopting an appropriate strategy to e-government implementation and narrowing the digital divide.

pub.1023752621,10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000097,From Origins to Implications: Key Aspects in the Debate over the Digital Divide,"Defined as the differential extent to which rich countries and poor countries benefit from various forms of information technology (IT), the global digital divide has been extensively measured and described in national as well as international debates. The problem, however, is that the topic is highly fragmented in the literature, with few attempts to put the parts into a coherent analytical framework. More precisely, there has been no specific attempt to pinpoint the main issues that influence one's view of the importance of the digital divide and the policies demanded by the different points of view. The goal of this paper, accordingly, is to fill this important gap in the literature in an analytical schema that recognizes the ways in which the impact of innovations depends heavily on how they are generated and diffused. At each stage of this sequential process are key issues that influence one's view of the digital divide. It matters a great deal for instance on whether the divide is in some sense unique, or just another manifestation of the general technological relationship between rich and poor countries. It is also the case that the size of the divide depends heavily on how it is measured. Yet another example is that the extent of the potential impact of IT will influence our view of the foregone opportunities associated with limited uptake of this technology in developing countries.",Journal of Information Technology,2007,22,3,284-295,"James, Jeffrey",Tilburg University,Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023752621,46,"[Singer, H.

The intent of this paper is to suggest successful ways of teaching computers through the discussion of a case study of Skylarkers 60 and Better Program and a longitudinal study conducted there.

Such projects have come to be known under the umbrella term “ICT4D projects” or Information and Communication Technology for Development projects.

Yet, it is on the basis of one's answer to this question that the difficulty of closing the divide ultimately depends. In this article, I have sought to challenge the (implicit) prevailing assumption in most of the digital-preparedness literature that variables can be perfectly substituted for one another and, hence, added together. In particular, and drawing on available evidence, I view the relationship between, say computers and computer skills, as being nearer the opposite extreme, of totally limited substitutability. On this basis, I suggest that the components of digital-preparedness indexes be multiplied rather than added. Using multiplication rather than addition in most current indexes of digital preparedness reveals a substantial understatement of the real difficulty in closing the digital divide and a different set of policies to deal with this larger problem. Such policies should include sharing arrangements and the use of intermediaries.",Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,2008,59,12,2024-2032,"James, Jeffrey",Tilburg University,Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035259834,15,"[James, Jeffrey]|[ur.07532230071.92]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2008|59|5|785-791|10.1002/asi.20793|pub.1005673281|11;[Sagar, Ambuj D; Najam, Adil]|[ur.013675350465.97; ur.014305115136.80]|Ecological Economics|1998|25|3|249-264|10.1016/s0921-8009(97)00168-7|pub.1007005696|386;[Meso, Peter; Datta, Pratim; Mbarika, Victor]|[ur.011164345533.13; ur.014541607227.93; ur.010076557303.64]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2005|57|2|186-197|10.1002/asi.20263|pub.1014276144|30;[James, Jeffrey]|[ur.07532230071.92]|Journal of Information Technology|2007|22|3|284-295|10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000097|pub.1023752621|46;[Stewart, Frances]|[]|Development Policy Review|1977|A10|1|92-105|10.1111/j.1467-7679.1977.tb00260.x|pub.1024680524|152;[van der Werf, Edwin]|[ur.010213472205.27]|Energy Economics|2008|30|6|2964-2979|10.1016/j.eneco.2008.05.008|pub.1033427296|149;[Stewart, Frances]|[]||1977||||10.1007/978-1-349-02914-3|pub.1035667501|171;[Glasgow, Russell E.; Klesges, Lisa M.; Dzewaltowski, David A.; Estabrooks, Paul A.; Vogt, Thomas M.]|[ur.01016202157.01; ur.0766545135.40; ur.01072622130.90; ur.01023664522.60; ur.0646170530.52]|Health Education Research|2006|21|5|688-694|10.1093/her/cyl081|pub.1040267418|402;[Stern, David I.]|[ur.01127765641.20]|Ecological Economics|1997|21|3|197-215|10.1016/s0921-8009(96)00103-6|pub.1041736571|103;[Kifle, Mengistu; Mbarika, Victor W.A.; Datta, Pratim]|[ur.01021240201.62; ur.010076557303.64; ur.014541607227.93]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2006|57|10|1383-1393|10.1002/asi.20448|pub.1051636305|25;[Bresnahan, T.

Although there has been recognition that the digital divide is more than technology access, there is an implicit belief that solving the access problem will also solve other aspects of the digital divide. We make the argument that variance in use involves cognition and is different than variance in access. We also argue that the context in which information technology is used makes a difference. We add to the digital divide research by proposing a model of digital sense making. The model helps explain the divide as a function of how information available through technology affects the ability to cope.

The concept of 'selective exclusion' (SE) is developed in relation to the digital divide, highlighting that technology is not always perceived as neutral or universally beneficial, but rather is negotiated in relation to specific socio-political contexts and alternative systems of knowledge. The concept of SE highlights the following: (a) 'Western' rationality and technology can be perceived as threats to indigenous identity and knowledge and as a result treated circumspectly; (b) nevertheless the 'Western' domain is seen as promising economic benefits, which need to be accessed; (c) therefore, the 'Western' domain and its associated technologies are selectively excluded; (d) the existence of a digital divide is not necessarily seen as negative as it offers protection against globalisation; and (e) the agency of indigenous individuals and communities is considered central and the ability to appropriate technology in relation to this is stressed.",South African Journal of Information Management,2009,11,1,,"Lotriet, H.; Matthee, M.; Mazanderani, F.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072231707,2,

In the last two decades scholars have gradually refined the conceptualization of digital divide, moving from a dichotomous model mainly based on access to a multidimensional model accounting for differences in usage levels and perspectives. While models became more complex, research continued to mainly focus on deepening the understanding of demographic and socioeconomic differences between adopters and non-adopters. In doing so, the process of basic IT skills acquisition has been largely overlooked. This paper presents a metaphorical interpretation of the process of IT skills acquisition derived from empirical evidence. The analysis highlights the presence of three distinct IT skills acquisition approaches, as well as the key role of self-learning. These preliminary results represent a useful starting point for the design of more effective and sophisticated inclusion policies.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2007,4656,,265-280,"Ferro, Enrico; Gil-Garcia, J.

Today, there is unequal access and use of those technologies, which is described as the 'digital divide'.

These 'Web.Punkte' offer access to computers and Internet for the community and support for external users by students. The project is embedded into a larger context of building a regional infrastructure for lifelong learning. Starting with interpretations of lifelong learning, this paper tries to combine those views with concepts to bridge the digital divide, explaining organizational barriers and success factors.

Theory Development and Policy Recommendations for Inclusive E-Government,"Digital divide is still a big topic in information systems and e-government research. In the past, several tracks and workshops on this topic existed. As information technology and especially the internet become more and more important governments cannot ignore the fact that elderly citizens are excluded from the benefits related to internet usage. Although e-Inclusion programmes and initiatives changed over the years and, moreover, although the amount of e-Inclusion literature is constantly growing, there is still no thorough understanding of potential factors influencing private internet usage. Hence, in this study we identify important influencing factors based on the literature on technology acceptance and digital divide. We develop a model based on these factors and test it against comprehensive survey data (n=192). Our theoretical model is able to explain more than 70% of the variation in private internet usage.

pub.1000580777,10.1080/01972240802587539,Digital Divide: A Discursive Move Away from the Real Inequities,"Within the context of the telecommunications policy environment in the United States during the 1990s, the Department of Commerce's Falling Through the Net reports can be read as a 7-year ideological project to legitimize U.S. government's deregulatory policies. This article analyzes the “digital divide” as rhetorical trope in a neoliberal ideology, which placed responsibility for social and economic success in the emerging global information economy at the level of the individual and not the system, effectively foreclosing on any class-based analyses of the problems associated with the transition from a Keynesian welfare state and industrial economy to a neoliberal and globalized information economy. Unpacking the discursive significance of the “digital divide,” with special focus on public libraries and projects of the Gates Foundation, illuminates how it foreclosed on the possibility of alternative problem definitions by making the problem a technical and administrative one rather than an issue of historic class struggle. The article draws on open-source projects in developing countries to offer an alternate frame for formulating policies for equitable access to information and communication technologies (ICTs).",The Information Society,2009,25,1,1-22,"Stevenson, Siobhan",University of Toronto,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1000580777,54,"[Day, Peter; Schuler, Doug]|[; ]||2004||||10.4324/9780203643730|pub.1004848305|25;[Bishop, Ann Peterson; Bruce, Bertram]|[ur.014126753237.06; ur.0616725154.36]|Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2006|31|6|6-10|10.1002/bult.2005.1720310603|pub.1005181798|18;[]|[]|||||||pub.1020660871|403;[Gurstein, Michael; Clement, Andrew; Shade, Leslie R.]|[; ur.01204320102.19; ur.07604737473.51]|Community Informatics|2000|||32-51|10.4018/978-1-878289-69-8.ch002|pub.1021193211|57;[Chan, Anita]|[]|Anthropological Quarterly|2004|77|3|531-545|10.1353/anq.2004.0046|pub.1021420524|40;[Davis, Jim]|[]|Race & Class|1999|40|2-3|37-48|10.1177/030639689904000204|pub.1022374866|9;[Bishop, Ann Peterson]|[ur.014126753237.06]|Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2005|26|3|6-7|10.1002/bult.149|pub.1024853935|1;[May, Christopher]|[ur.013222330615.49]|Political Studies|2006|54|1|123-146|10.1111/j.1467-9248.2006.00569.x|pub.1026763995|24;[Harris, Jerry]|[]|Race & Class|1999|40|2-3|21-35|10.1177/030639689904000203|pub.1028664420|21;[Kundnani, Arun]|[]|Race & Class|1999|40|2-3|49-71|10.1177/030639689904000205|pub.1040548975|12;[Trebing, Harry M.]|[ur.011400414752.94]|Journal of Economic Issues|2004|38|1|1-27|10.1080/00213624.2004.11506663|pub.1043988865|11;[Humphreys, Ashlee; Grayson, Kent]|[ur.012025163425.32; ur.014706317221.20]|Sociology Compass|2008|2|3|963-980|10.1111/j.1751-9020.2008.00112.x|pub.1048717434|291;[Fisher, Donald]|[]|Sociology|1983|17|2|206-233|10.1177/0038038583017002004|pub.1053781168|108;[Bucy, Erik P.]|[ur.0747524746.23]|Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics|2000|5|1|50-61|10.1177/1081180x00005001005|pub.1063971087|96;[Martin, Steven P.; Robinson, John P.]|[; ]|Social Problems|2007|54|1|1-22|10.1525/sp.2007.54.1.1|pub.1067700006|93;[Bertot, John Carlo; Jaeger, Paul T.; Langa, Lesley A.; McClure, Charles R.]|[ur.011253735727.32; ur.011542112017.14; ur.012363174455.21; ur.011622741644.06]|First Monday|2006||||10.5210/fm.v11i9.1392|pub.1072709357|71;[Stevenson, Siobhan]|[]|First Monday|2007||||10.5210/fm.v12i5.1833|pub.1072709430|5;[Ghosh, Rishab Aiyer]|[ur.013146265407.40]|First Monday|2003|8|12||10.5210/fm.v8i12.1103|pub.1072710817|28;[Gurstein, Michael]|[]|First Monday|2003|8|12||10.5210/fm.v8i12.1107|pub.1072710821|187;[Karl, B D; Katz, S N]|[ur.01274664605.43; ur.01343000005.52]|Daedalus|1987|116|1|1-40||pub.1074899108|67;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]||2001||||10.1017/cbo9781139164887|pub.1098663486|2054;[Gandy, Oscar H.]|[]|Handbook of New Media: Social Shaping and Consequences of ICTs|2002|||448-460|10.4135/9781848608245.n32|pub.1100891182|8;[Fischer, Frank; Forester, John]|[]|The Argumentative Turn in Policy Analysis and Planning|1993||||10.1215/9780822381815|pub.1108571990|832;[O’Connor, James]|[]||1973||||10.1007/978-1-349-06273-7|pub.1109031773|1668;[Servon, Lisa J.]|[]|Bridging the Digital Divide|2002||||10.1002/9780470773529|pub.1109492537|180;[Compaine, Benjamin M.]|[]|The Digital Divide|2001||||10.7551/mitpress/2419.001.0001|pub.1110922707|242;[]|[]|A Brief History of Neoliberalism|2005||||10.1093/oso/9780199283262.001.0001|pub.1132512602|8127"

pub.1072709682,10.5210/fm.v15i2.2599,"Sociological implications of scientific publishing: Open access, science, society, democracy and the digital divide","Claims for Open Access are mostly underpinned with   a) science-related arguments (Open Access accelerates scientific communication)  b) financial arguments (Open Access relieves the serials crisis),   c) social arguments (Open Access reduces the Digital Divide),   d) democracy-related arguments (Open Access facilitates participation)  e) and socio-political arguments (Open Access levels disparities).    Using sociological concepts and notions, this article analyses some of the assumptions mentioned above. It focuses strongly on Pierre Bourdieu's theory of (scientific) capital and its implications for the acceptance of Open Access, on Michel Foucault's discourse analysis and on the implications of Open Access for the concept of the Digital Divide. Bourdieu's theory of capital implies that the acceptance of Open Access depends on the logic of power and the accumulation of scientific capital. It does not depend on slogans derived from hagiographic self-perceptions of science (e.g. the acceleration of scientific communication) and scientists (e.g. their will to share their information freely). According to Bourdieu's theory, it is crucial for Open Access (and associated concepts like alternative impact metrics) how scientists perceive its potential influence on existing processes of capital accumulation and how Open Access will affect their demand for distinction. Concerning the Digital Divide concept, Foucault's discourse analysis suggests that Open Access may intensify disparities, scientocentrisms and ethnocentrisms. Additionally, several concepts from the philosophy of sciences (Karl Raimund Popper, Samuel Kuhn, Paul Feyerabend) and their implicit connection to the concept of Open Access are described in this paper.",First Monday,2010,,,,"Herb, Ulrich",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072709682,17,
pub.1068766124,10.19173/irrodl.v12i6.1053,ODL and the impact of digital divide on information access in Botswana,"Open and distance learning (ODL) has created room for the emergence of virtual education. Not only are students found everywhere and anywhere undertaking their studies and earning their degrees, but geographical boundaries between nations no longer appear to have much relevance. As the new education paradigm irretrievably alters the way teaching and learning is conducted, the application of modern educational ICTs has a major role to play.With students of transnational or cross-border education dispersed into various nooks and crannies of Botswana, many others enlist for the “home-baked” distance learning programmes from their diverse locations. Like the face-to-face conventional students, distance learners also have information needs which have to be met. But blocking the distance learners’ realization of their information needs is the digital divide, which further marginalizes the underclass of “info-poor.”The survey method was used, and a questionnaire administered to 519 students of four tertiary level distance teaching institutions that met the criteria set for the study yielded a 70.1% response rate. The results showed that while the Government of Botswana has made considerable effort to ensure country-wide access to ICT, which now constitutes an effective instrument for meeting information needs, a number of problems still exist. The factors impeding easy access are unearthed. The findings of an empirical study portraying some learners as information-rich and others, information-poor, and the consequence of distance learners studying on both sides of the digital divide, are discussed. Suggestions on bridging the digital divide are offered.",The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning,2011,12,6,157,"Oladokun, Olugbade; Aina, Lenrie",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1068766124,10,
pub.1010694554,10.4000/netcom.453,The geographical digital divide in broadband access and governmental policies in Japan: three case studies,"Broadband access is indispensable for advanced Internet services, because voluminous data transfers have recently become popular in developed societies. Although broadband access has spread to a certain degree in developed countries/regions, geographical gaps in broadband access (the so-called “geographical digital divide”) remain. Based on three case studies in less-favoured areas of Japan (Hokkaido, Nagano Prefecture and Mie Prefecture), we examined how the geographical digital divide is being bridged, and the contributions that national and local government policies make to this process. Several implications were apparent. First, integrating communication infrastructures with manifold digital services, such as cable television services and broadband access, is an effective way to extend broadband to less-favoured areas. The Japanese government has promoted the construction of digital cable television networks, and they have played a significant role in the completion of universal broadband services. The challenge of digitizing terrestrial television broadcasting has been behind these policies. Another effective means of extending broadband has been the pressure exerted by local governments (under the national policy scheme) on private cable television companies to bring their services to even the least populated regions. Finally, in those areas where private digital network services are unprofitable, the establishment of a publicly funded cable business (using a budget-transfer scheme, for example) may be an effective option for extending broadband services. In general, the challenge of bridging the geographical digital divide should be tackled with a broad set of regional promotion policies for less-favoured regions.",Netcom,2010,,24-1/2,7-26,"Arai, Yoshio; Naganuma, Sae",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010694554,12,"[Downes, Tom; Greenstein, Shane]|[ur.012734216147.69; ur.015422614573.48]|Journal of Urban Economics|2007|62|1|2-26|10.1016/j.jue.2006.10.004|pub.1002066231|23;[Arai, Yoshio]|[]|Netcom|2007||21-3/4|315-330|10.4000/netcom.2237|pub.1008980851|5;[Wood, Lawrence E.]|[]|Netcom|2007||21-3/4|349-362|10.4000/netcom.2252|pub.1009360480|4;[Graham, Stephen]|[]|Urban Studies|2002|39|1|33-56|10.1080/00420980220099050|pub.1010968716|244;[Grubesic, Tony H.; Murray, Alan T.]|[ur.01102232364.97; ur.011335074125.33]|Papers of the Regional Science Association|2005|81|2|197-221|10.1111/j.1435-5597.2002.tb01230.x|pub.1028500885|38;[Downes, Tom; Greenstein, Shane]|[ur.012734216147.69; ur.015422614573.48]|Research Policy|2002|31|7|1035-1052|10.1016/s0048-7333(01)00177-9|pub.1043775044|31"

This should include improving affordability through a competitive environment, encouraging the use of radio technology and upgrading village public telephones to Public Tele Information Centers (PTICs).

However, certain elements of society have less access to technology than others. In the literature, discussions and research on these discrepancies tend to focus on factors such as gender, sex, socioeconomic status, race, education, and employment. Occasionally, age is taken into consideration. In reviewing online articles related to the digital divide, it appears that there are many more articles, reports, and projects that focus on factors other than age. Few looked at the impact of the digital divide on senior citizens. One article, “The Internet and Older Adults” (U.S. Administration on Aging, 2004), reports that: Senior citizens comprise 13% of the U.S. population, but just 4% of the U.S. Internet population. Since their numbers are so small, there has not been much research about what these ‘wired seniors’ are doing online and how they feel about the Internet. It turns out that seniors who have Internet access benefit greatly from the resources available online—communicating with family, researching health information, tracking their investments—all from the comfort of their home or senior center. (paragraph 2) The term “digital divide” is often heard and freely used, but what is it? It has been defined by Carvin (2000) as: “…the gap between those people and communities with access to information technology and those without it. Yet, the fact is there are many divides, characterized by community, ethnic, economic, and age groups.” He goes on to add that “households earning incomes over $75,000 are over 20 times more likely to have home Internet access than those at the lowest income levels” (Carvin, 2000, paragraph 1).","Encyclopedia of Distance Learning, Second Edition",2009,,,1578-1584,"Rogers, Patricia L.; Berg, Gary A.; Boettcher, Judith V.; Howard, Caroline; Justice, Lorraine; Schenk, Karen D.; Mizell, Al P.; Sugarman, Cecil",Nova Southeastern University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1036936823,0,

Atlanta's initiative has taken the form of community technology centres where citizens can come to get exposure to the internet, and learn something about computers and their applications. LaGrange has taken a very different approach, providing free internet access to the home via a digital cable set-top box. Using theoretical constructs from Bourdieu, we analysed how the target populations and service providers reacted to the two initiatives, how these reactions served to reproduce the digital divide, and the lessons for future digital divide initiatives. In our findings and analysis, we see a reinforcement of the status quo. When people embrace these initiatives, they are full of enthusiasm, and there is no question that some learning occurs and that the programmes are beneficial. However, there is no mechanism for people to go to the next step, whether that is technical certification, going to college, buying a personal computer or escaping the poverty that put them on the losing end of the divide in the first place. This leads us to conclude that the Atlanta and LaGrange programmes could be classified as successes in the sense that they provided access and basic computer literacy to people lacking these resources.

pub.1042240728,10.4038/jfa.v1i2.1798,Digital Divide in the Corporate Tea Sector in Sri Lanka: An Empirical Investigation,"The rapid developments in the field of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in an economy can at the same time create a ""gap"" between those businesses that adopt such technologies ""in a flash"" (innovators) and ""at a snail's pace"" (laggards), which is commonly referred to as Digital Divide. The purpose of this study was to examine empirically the current status of adoption of ICT and in turn the digital divide resulting from which in the corporate tea production sector in Sri Lanka and the factors affecting this behavior. A questionnaire based survey (n = 121) was carried out to collect the data from the managers responsible for ICT of the tea estates located in the Low, Mid and Up country. An empirical model was developed to show the relationship between the level of adoption of 12 Basic, Intermediate and Advanced ICT facilities and a number of factors to reflect the managerial, production and financial aspects of tea estates. Based on the Innovation - Diffusion Theory the status of Digital Divide of an estate was specified by means of an Index. An Ordered Logistic Regression technique was employed to estimate the coefficients of the model. The results show that these estates did not become innovators or early-adopters of ICT by adopting Advanced or intermediate type of technologies, but were mostly confined to the Basic facilities. The results from the OLR highlight that the turnover of tea estate, ICT literacy, attitudes of managers and IT training of the staff have a significant impact on the adoption of ICT.

pub.1005544128,10.1080/13691180600630732,Bridging the dual digital divide: A Local Net and an IT-Café in Sweden,"The Internet is becoming an integral part of everyday life and digital inclusion is becoming a prerequisite for social inclusion. There is a risk that marginalized groups in deprived areas may be excluded from the Information Society, being affected by the ‘dual digital divide’. This paper concerns two community initiatives designed to encourage digital and social inclusion in a disadvantaged area: a Local Net and an IT-Café. A combination of qualitative and quantitative data from a case study in a suburb of Stockholm is used to examine the two schemes in terms of their success in bridging the dual digital divide. Despite good intentions, the Local Net, with its provision of home access to local web pages, largely failed to achieve its goals. In contrast, the IT-Café, with its public access to ICTs, has increased digital and social inclusion of those residents who make use of it. Six reasons for the difference in success between the two computer projects are identified: (1) timing, (2) management, (3) cost, (4) support and training, (5) context of access and (6) project focus. The provision of subsidized public access, the informal face-to-face computer support and training provided by a local resident working in the IT-Café, and the ease with which both virtual and physical meetings can be supported are factors underlying the success of the IT-Café. The paper concludes that access, skills and motivation are prerequisites for a digitally inclusive society. To be on the right side of the (dual) digital divide it is vital to have physical access to technologies, but also to have the skills and motivation to use them.",Information Communication & Society,2006,9,2,137-159,"Ferlander, Sara; Timms, Duncan",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005544128,17,"[Liff, Sonia; Steward, Fred]|[ur.015432352362.07; ur.07710634033.98]|Information Communication & Society|2001|4|3|317-340|10.1080/713768550|pub.1000746199|17;[De Cindio, Fiorella; Gentile, Oliverio; Grew, Philip; Redolfi, Daniela]|[ur.014426447065.54; ur.012304474517.14; ; ]|The Information Society|2003|19|5|395-406|10.1080/714044686|pub.1014458066|22;[Crossan, Beth; Gallacher, Jim; Osborne, Michael]|[ur.011761034411.14; ur.013353775411.13; ur.015435204553.38]||2004||||10.4324/9780203300305|pub.1014861253|56;[Carroll, John M.; Rosson, Mary Beth]|[ur.07616047675.26; ur.01216337450.03]|The Information Society|2003|19|5|381-393|10.1080/714044685|pub.1022367606|41;[Mesch, Gustavo S.; Levanon, Yael]|[ur.016665425115.51; ]|City and Community|2003|2|4|335-351|10.1046/j.1535-6841.2003.00059.x|pub.1031083492|39;[Liff, Sonia; Lægran, Anne Sofie]|[ur.015432352362.07; ur.01155250010.12]|New Media & Society|2003|5|3|307-312|10.1177/14614448030053001|pub.1035478162|16;[Ferlander, Sara; Timms, Duncan]|[ur.0627715457.58; ur.0702464615.15]|Telematics and Informatics|2001|18|1|51-65|10.1016/s0736-5853(00)00018-6|pub.1037425397|13;[Kavanaugh, Andrea L.; Patterson, Scott J.]|[; ]|The Internet in Everyday Life|2002|||325-344|10.1002/9780470774298.ch11|pub.1039903495|35;[Kubicek, Herbert; Wagner, Rose M.]|[; ]|Information Communication & Society|2002|5|3|291-319|10.1080/13691180210159274|pub.1042435882|23;[Wakeford, Nina]|[ur.011515642443.42]|New Media & Society|2003|5|3|379-399|10.1177/14614448030053005|pub.1044045061|65;[van Dijk, Jan; Hacker, Kenneth]|[; ]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|315-326|10.1080/01972240309487|pub.1047421245|709;[Uotinen, Johanna]|[ur.0762234704.44]|New Media & Society|2003|5|3|335-356|10.1177/14614448030053003|pub.1048790217|17;[Hampton, Keith N.]|[ur.012317624303.24]|The Information Society|2003|19|5|417-428|10.1080/714044688|pub.1051395974|119;[Warschauer, Mark]|[]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|297-304|10.1080/01972240309490|pub.1051403945|133;[Blanchard, Anita; Horan, Tom]|[ur.016460421045.25; ur.015050061357.69]|Social Science Computer Review|1998|16|3|293-307|10.1177/089443939801600306|pub.1063873857|166;[Crump, Barbara; McIlroy, Andrea]|[; ]|First Monday|2003|8|12||10.5210/fm.v8i12.1106|pub.1072710820|22;[Castells, Manuel]|[]||2002||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199255771.001.0001|pub.1098765389|476;[Wellman, Barry; Haythornthwaite, Caroline]|[]|The Internet in Everyday Life|2002||||10.1002/9780470774298|pub.1109492440|388;[Castells, Manuel]|[]||2001||||10.1007/978-3-322-89613-1|pub.1109708492|1326"

We take this project as a case study in order to show how we dealt with the digital divide. The digital divide denotes a knowledge and communication gap that finally leads to social disintegration caused by unequal ownership of information and communication technology (ICT) and unequally distributed access to the online world. It separates the society into so-called onliners and “none-liners”. The digital divide is caused by social factors like age, gender, education, and local infrastructure (Arnhold in Digital Divide.

pub.1063002983,10.1142/s0219649202000121,Knowledge Economy and the Digital Divide in Asia,"The rapid rise of the knowledge-based economy has resulted in an increasing gap between knowledge ""haves"" and ""have nots"", a phenomenon now widely referred to as the digital divide. This divide has become particularly apparent in Asia, a region that is home to some of the highest and lowest digital technology penetration rates in the world. Failing to adequately bridge this divide will inevitably result in greater disparities among the economies of the region. This paper provides an overview of the driving forces and key characteristics of the knowledge economy. It outlines some of the opportunities and challenges the knowledge economy presents to policy makers, societies, businesses and individuals alike. Emphasis in this paper is given to the need for assessing ""e-readiness"" as a critical first step in initiating any major developmental effort. This is accompanied by a broad-based assessment of the level of e-readiness in Asia, along with an examination of the crucial link between income levels and telecommunications service costs with digital connectivity. Concrete examples of actions being undertaken by non-profit organizations, corporations and individuals to bridge the digital divide in Asia are then presented, followed by some concluding remarks.",Journal of Information & Knowledge Management,2002,1,01,7-15,"Gleave, Tom; Al-Hawamdeh, Suliman",Nanyang Technological University,Singapore,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063002983,2,

Most of these benefits occur as a result of intermediaries who, in one way or another, transfer relevant parts of the knowledge available from the technology to recipients in a form that is relevant to their specific needs. Using India as an illustration of this argument, we find that usage understates actual beneficiaries by at least 30 percent. On the basis of this finding, we suggest that a reconstrued notion of the digital divide be based on usage as well as other more indirect forms of benefit from the Internet in developing countries. To this end, much more needs to be known about these other forms of benefit in a large sample of countries in addition to India.",Journal of Information Technology,2004,19,3,172-177,"James, Jeffrey",Tilburg University,Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034378460,27,"[James, Jeffrey]|[]||2004||||10.4324/9780203325506|pub.1109738563|19"
pub.1033747716,10.1057/ejis.2010.64,The digital divide and t-government in the United States: using the technology acceptance model to understand usage,"This paper applies the technology acceptance model to explore the digital divide and transformational government (t-government) in the United States. Successful t-government is predicated on citizen adoption and usage of e-government services. The contribution of this research is to enhance our understanding of the factors associated with the usage of e-government services among members of a community on the unfortunate side of the divide. A questionnaire was administered to members, of a techno-disadvantaged public housing community and neighboring households, who partook in training or used the community computer lab. The results indicate that perceived access barriers and perceived ease of use (PEOU) are significantly associated with usage, while perceived usefulness (PU) is not. Among the demographic characteristics, educational level, employment status, and household income all have a significant impact on access barriers and employment is significantly associated with PEOU. Finally, PEOU is significantly related to PU. Overall, the results emphasize that t-government cannot cross the digital divide without accompanying employment programs and programs that enhance citizens’ ease in using such services.",European Journal of Information Systems,2011,20,3,308-328,"Sipior, Janice C;

The purpose of Phase II, Keeping communities connected: The next step is to help public libraries sustain the public access computing infrastructure laid down during Phase I. Now, as then, the goal of the program is to bridge the digital divide. But it is a digital divide as defined by Bill Gates and not the public library community. Situating Gates’ philanthropy within a critical policy frame, this paper considers two alternatives to Gates’ problem definition of the digital divide, and how knowledge of these might benefit those communities served by public access computing (PAC) services as found in public libraries. The two specific alternatives considered come from the Free Software Foundation (FSF), and Community Informatics (CI). Significantly, both social movements promote the potential of free and open software as an important part of any solution. Finally, the public library literature is reviewed for patterns in the community’s use of FOSS, and the argument is made for its use in the delivery of PAC services.",First Monday,2007,,,,"Stevenson, Siobhan",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072709430,5,

Government at local and state levels have taken a leading role in the development of electronic marketplaces with an aim of improving the lot for SMEs. Many government departments now either own or sponsor electronic marketplaces. Government aims in creating e-marketplaces are often motivated by regional economic development issues. Whilst government entities may think e-marketplaces are an effective channel for implementing government policy a number of complications can arise from this model, not least is being seen as stifling free trade. Despite the community development motivation a major argument for e-marketplace development being put forward is the economic one and this has contributed to a narrow view of the e-marketplace concept and one, which for the time being at least, is likely to restrict its impact. Government sponsored e-marketplaces should consider the value of on-line business networks to share knowledge and potentially increase levels of innovation.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2003,,,339-353,"Standing, C.; Sims, I.; Stockdale, R.; Wassenaar, A.",Edith Cowan University; University of Twente,Australia; Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1017065123,7,"[van Akkeren, Jeanette K.; Cavaye, Angèle L.M.]|[ur.013621715367.30; ur.015214656367.74]|Journal of Systems and Information Technology|1999|3|2|33-48|10.1108/13287269980000747|pub.1019199478|36;[Tetteh, Emmanuel; Burn, Janice]|[ur.010701253035.79; ur.07353464643.84]|Logistics Information Management|2001|14|1/2|171-180|10.1108/09576050110363202|pub.1022004068|95;[Brunn, Peter; Jensen, Martin; Skovgaard, Jakob]|[; ; ]|European Management Journal|2002|20|3|286-298|10.1016/s0263-2373(02)00045-2|pub.1042456448|107;[Williamson, Oliver E.]|[ur.011657615514.15]|The Journal of Law and Economics|1979|22|2|233-261|10.1086/466942|pub.1058751592|5578;[Barrett, Stephanie; Konsynski, Benn]|[; ur.016331146545.19]|MIS Quarterly|1982|6||93|10.2307/248993|pub.1102514625|264"
pub.1069364592,10.2304/rcie.2007.2.1.1,Digital Literacy Research from an International and Comparative Point of View,"The fear of a growing digital divide between those having access to the Internet and those who do not results from the still uneven distribution of digital media. Though the number of Internet users is rapidly growing, there is evidence for the further existence of a digital divide caused by the lack of digital literacy. Thus, the digital divide cannot be closed by access alone and becomes a matter of media education. To find appropriate methods for increasing digital literacy demands knowledge about the ways users deal with computers and the Internet. This knowledge is gained by empirical research in different formal and non-formal contexts of computer and Internet use. This introductory article to a special issue of Research in Comparative and International Education devoted to ‘Digital Literacy Research’ gives an insight into international data on Internet use and outlines a theoretical framework of digital literacy. It also discusses the single studies collected in the special issue. It shows that further research will profit by an international and comparative approach which considers national, cultural, social and age differences between the users.",Research in Comparative and International Education,2007,2,1,1-12,"Pietrass, Manuela",Bundeswehr University Munich,Germany,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1069364592,11,"[Westram, Hiltrud]|[ur.012160477257.00]|Forschung Erziehungswissenschaft|2000||||10.1007/978-3-322-97493-8|pub.1024266216|6;[]|[]|The Network Society|2004||||10.4337/9781845421663|pub.1030824724|345;[Schorb, Bernd]|[]|Handbuch der Medienpädagogik|1994|||149-166|10.1007/978-3-322-89931-6_9|pub.1045194258|8;[Toner, Peter G.]|[ur.0636552002.43]|The Journal of Pathology|2000|190|3|233-233|10.1002/(sici)1096-9896(200002)190:3<233::aid-path601>3.0.co;2-s|pub.1052932827|2;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|First Monday|2002|7|4||10.5210/fm.v7i4.942|pub.1072710742|980;[Marr, Mirko]|[]|Medien & Kommunikationswissenschaft|2004|52|1|76-94|10.5771/1615-634x-2004-1-76|pub.1073121471|12;[Riehm, Ulrich; Krings, Bettina-Johanna]|[ur.011732367415.91; ur.013447012705.08]|Medien & Kommunikationswissenschaft|2006|54|1|75-94|10.5771/1615-634x-2006-1-75|pub.1073121622|15;[Kerres, Michael; De Witt, Claudia]|[ur.07477466631.86; ur.011253450623.85]|MedienPädagogik Zeitschrift für Theorie und Praxis der Medienbildung|2002|6|0|1-22|10.21240/mpaed/06/2002.11.08.x|pub.1100648612|16;[Buckingham, David]|[]|MedienPädagogik Zeitschrift für Theorie und Praxis der Medienbildung|2005|11|0|1-14|10.21240/mpaed/11/2005.09.27.x|pub.1100650245|18;[Marotzki, Winfried; Nohl, Arnd-Michael; Ortlepp, Wolfgang]|[ur.015673066057.38; ur.014333470031.11; ur.010327603553.36]|MedienPädagogik Zeitschrift für Theorie und Praxis der Medienbildung|2003|7|0|1-18|10.21240/mpaed/07/2003.07.21.x|pub.1100654047|3;[]|[]||2005||||10.2307/j.ctvbkk4jp|pub.1112819160|40"

Importantly, as fixed broadband service is provided locally the benefits are limited to local inhabitants. By contrast, mobile service is provided via a spectrum user fee system.

pub.1040565818,10.1016/j.compedu.2006.07.005,The correlates of the digital divide and their impact on college student learning,"By focusing on two dimensions of the digital divide—computer use and computer knowledge, this study explores four research questions: (1) What are the undergraduates doing with the computers they use at colleges? (2) How do undergraduates perform in regard to computer knowledge and skills? (3) With what is the digital divide among college students correlated? (4) What consequences does the digital divide have for student academic performance? In order to answer these research questions, a national survey was conducted. The survey investigated 3083 first-year college students of 12 4-year universities in Taiwan. A total of 2719 of them completed the questionnaires resulting in a response rate of 88.2%. In this study, the digital divide is measured in terms of computer use, which includes a variety of purposes for using computers and academic-related work as a proportion of total computer hours, and computer knowledge. Multiple regressions and a generalized ordered logit, i.e. a partial proportional odds model, are employed. The main findings include the following: (1) Undergraduates use computers not only for fulfilling their academic requirements and searching for information, but also for entertainment. On average, undergraduates spend about 19h per week using computers, of which 5h are academic-related. (2) Most undergraduates perform at the middle average level in terms of computer knowledge. (3) No significant differences among correlates in relating to demographic and socioeconomic family background were found in predicting the various purposes in using computers. (4) Students who are female, whose fathers and/or whose mothers are from minorities, whose fathers are blue-collar workers or unemployed, who study in the fields of the humanities and social sciences, and who enter private universities are at a disadvantage in terms of computer skills and knowledge. However, female students, students whose mothers were less educated and students who enroll in private universities are more focused computer users in terms of allocating time to academic-related work. (5) Computer knowledge and devotion to using computers for academic-related work have a moderate effect on college student learning, while the various other uses of computers do not. Of the different kinds of computer knowledge, it is the knowledge of software that helps students to learn the most.",Computers & Education,2008,50,1,421-436,"Tien, Flora F.; Fu, Tsu-Tan","National Taiwan University; Institute of Economics, Academia Sinica; Academia Sinica",Taiwan; Taiwan; Taiwan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040565818,54,"[Chang, Li-Jie; Chou, Chih-Yueh; Chen, Zhi-Hong; Chan, Tak-Wai]|[ur.014063001143.28; ur.011545605077.43; ur.015455742143.41; ur.014670653551.50]|International Journal of Educational Development|2004|24|4|383-396|10.1016/j.ijedudev.2004.02.001|pub.1003542537|5;[Mansell, Robin]|[ur.013665171232.89]|Current Sociology|2002|50|3|407-426|10.1177/0011392102050003007|pub.1004956599|130;[Kaminer, Noam]|[ur.010266211506.37]|Library & Information Science Research|1997|19|4|329-345|10.1016/s0740-8188(97)90024-4|pub.1005234373|23;[Albright, Michael J.]|[]|New Directions for Teaching and Learning|1999|1999|80|91-98|10.1002/tl.8008|pub.1007828222|3;[Colley, Ann; Comber, Chris]|[ur.010723166662.42; ur.015247667621.75]|Educational Research|2003|45|2|155-165|10.1080/0013188032000103235|pub.1010243817|131;[Kelkar, Govind; Nathan, Dev]|[ur.015007422253.21; ur.07413675615.62]|Current Sociology|2002|50|3|427-441|10.1177/0011392102050003008|pub.1010369655|40;[Jones*, Norah; O'Shea, John]|[; ]|Higher Education|2004|48|3|379-395|10.1023/b:high.0000035560.32573.d0|pub.1013420310|48;[Torkzadeh, Gholamreza; Lee, Jungwoo]|[ur.012742365314.52; ur.010336541003.54]|Information & Management|2003|40|7|607-615|10.1016/s0378-7206(02)00090-3|pub.1013459619|71;[Finn, Seth; Inman, John G.]|[ur.016515154157.12; ]|Journal of Research on Technology in Education|2004|36|3|297-317|10.1080/15391523.2004.10782417|pub.1013541853|33;[Chou, Chien; Hsiao, Ming-Chun]|[ur.013506314107.68; ]|Computers & Education|2000|35|1|65-80|10.1016/s0360-1315(00)00019-1|pub.1014759139|391;[Zain, Muhammad Z.M; Atan, Hanafi; Idrus, Rozhan M]|[ur.011706176432.79; ur.010745541645.92; ur.014054213227.32]|International Journal of Educational Development|2004|24|2|201-211|10.1016/j.ijedudev.2003.10.010|pub.1014867631|17;[Kuh, George D.; Vesper, Nick]|[ur.07727757311.29; ur.014344435053.28]|Research in Higher Education|2001|42|1|87-102|10.1023/a:1018768612002|pub.1018498398|31;[Wells, Joan; Silk, Elizabeth; Torres, David]|[; ; ]|New Directions for Institutional Research|1999|1999|103|23-39|10.1002/ir.10302|pub.1019843565|3;[Fan, Tai-Sheng; Li, Yi-Ching]|[ur.012270121661.72; ur.015256023661.35]|Computers & Education|2005|44|3|285-300|10.1016/j.compedu.2004.02.003|pub.1023740730|26;[Johnson, Helen]|[]|Asian Journal of Women's Studies|2003|9|1|60-79|10.1080/12259276.2003.11665943|pub.1023797871|3;[Lassner, David]|[]|New Directions for Higher Education|2000|2000|111|35-44|10.1002/he.11104|pub.1024828755|3;[von Hellens, Liisa; Nielsen, Sue]|[ur.010430272613.33; ur.014147725327.56]|Communications of the ACM|2001|44|7|46-52|10.1145/379300.379310|pub.1027130074|41;[COLLEY, ANN; COER, CHRIS]|[; ]|Educational Studies|2003|29|1|59-67|10.1080/03055690303269|pub.1027173597|29;[Papastergiou, Marina; Solomonidou, Christina]|[ur.011727104201.39; ur.013242517207.08]|Computers & Education|2005|44|4|377-393|10.1016/j.compedu.2004.04.002|pub.1028544161|93;[Foster, Susan J.; Hollowell, David E.]|[; ]|New Directions for Institutional Research|1999|1999|102|9-19|10.1002/ir.10201|pub.1030981949|4;[Surtees, P.

First they describe how accessibility is traditionally understood in usability design and what issues mobility brings to accessibility. Secondly, equality issues are discussed in the context of a digital divide.

It then discusses the linkage between gender and ICT especially how ICT has widened the digital divide gap between Africa and the rest of the world on one hand, and between males and females on the other. It later gives an overview of the ICT policy formulation situation in Africa pointing out the gender provisions in the national ICT policy documents of some African countries. It then reviews illiteracy rates and access to telephone facilities, computers, and Internet facilities in Africa and indicates that there is a digital divide on the continent between those who have access to the Internet and related technologies and those who do not. It finally presents the policy options and strategies to be adopted by African governments to enable women to benefit from opportunities offered by ICT.

pub.1026676526,10.1002/itdj.20067,Open access towards bridging the digital divide–policies and strategies for developing countries,"There is a consensus that Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) hold great promise for development by connecting people to more accurate and up-to-date sources of information and knowledge. However, the evidence so far shows that the benefits accrued from the utilization of ICTs have been inequitably distributed with most developing countries (particularly Africa) facing the prospect of being marginalized. Inequality of access to information and technological advantages among scientists becomes a crucial factor in formal science, and Africa can be said to be suffering from a scientific information famine. So the key question addressed in this article is, will open access solve Africa's information famine and help the continent bridge the digital divide? This article aims to assess and evaluate the open access movement as a proposed solution to avoid the restrictions over accessing scientific knowledge in Africa. I find it more important that the article outlines the problems that can be observed and what opportunities for building OA in Africa are available. Finally, the article concludes with a discussion of strategic and policy implications of these findings for bridging the digital divide and building OA in Africa. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Information Technology for Development,2007,13,4,337-361,"Ahmed, Allam",University of Sussex,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026676526,32,"[Riddoch, Indra]|[]|Nature|2000|408|6811|402-402|10.1038/35044264|pub.1003366765|5;[]|[]|Technological Learning|2004||||10.4337/9781845426910|pub.1027347799|19;[Tagler, John]|[]|The Serials Librarian|1996|28|1-2|171-179|10.1300/j123v28n01_18|pub.1030518855|4;[DiMaggio, Paul; Hargittai, Eszter; Neuman, W.

Most experts agree that citizens will need competencies that go beyond the basic cultural skills. Where can our citizens acquire these competencies? The idea of life-long-learning illustrates a major problem of our educational institutions: they work separately, they only process the results of the preceding phase and there is a lack of interconnection. This paper tries to develop a concept of a regional education network that includes pre-school, K-12 and further education, public libraries and community centres as well as other educational institutions. Taking the path of the digital divide as a social and educational divide and focusing on the school as one major player in the regional network, the innovation process and the actors involved in it are highlighted and explored. Using action research in a project between schools, local community, private partners and the university, the concept of the regional network is illustrated. The problems encountered in the project are described and discussed in order to give a realistic overview and impression of an integrated education policy.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2003,116,,207-214,"Breiter, Andreas",University of Bremen,Germany,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041483806,3,"[Rapoport, Robert N.]|[]|Human Relations|1970|23|6|499-513|10.1177/001872677002300601|pub.1005113379|475;[Baskerville, R; Wood-Harper, A T]|[ur.014211036615.49; ur.07776436662.19]|European Journal of Information Systems|1998|7|2|90-107|10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000298|pub.1037396829|316;[Brynjolfsson, Erik; Hitt, Lorin]|[ur.016410366727.06; ur.014164101470.22]|Management Science|1996|42|4|541-558|10.1287/mnsc.42.4.541|pub.1064721491|1114"

Based on the data from The National Survey of Information Technology Use in China Primary and Secondary Schools 2004, which is the latest large survey of informatization in china. At first, this study analyzes the Digital Gap in current China. We selected 15 provinces as samples, their data helped us to know about how the Digital Gap is in China nowadays. The statistic data showed that there are significant differences between the east China and the central-west China on the dimension of hardware. But there were some results that couldn't be explained by current theories. Then this study drew the conclusion that it was the individual differences that partly caused the Digital Gap in China. Among all the individual factors that influence the Digital Gap, this study created the dimension of “Information Intention” to complete the structure of Information Literacy. Information Intention means that the subject can not only sense the value and the latent meaning of information, but also form positive internal wanting of information, change the wanting into the action, be willing to connect the information with actual work, learning, life. It is a habitual trend to information, on behalf of the tendentiousness of the person. A person with information intention is in the open, receivable state, being willing to take, process, select, evaluate, transfer information.

Research approach -- Critical review of 5 experiments on Web Information Search which manipulated system and users' variables. Findings/Design -- The results highlight the relevance of 3 cognitive factors as predictors of Web information search efficiency for deaf people: reading skills, verbal categorization abilities and visual-spatial span. Additionally, the results suggest that the usage of textual hyperlinks linked to videos with their Sing Language translations seems to be an efficient Web navigation mechanism for deaf signer users. Research limitations/Implications -- A small number of deaf signer users participated in the set of studies, which limited a possible generalisation of the findings. Originality/Value -- The research makes a contribution to the knowledge about how cognitive and systems factors interact and how this knowledge can be used to increase Web information scents for deaf signer people.

References are made to information “haves” and “have-nots” in an age where information is equivalent to wealth (Holloway, 2000). The “have-nots” are in danger of exclusion from the new economy and marginalization into low-wage jobs (Dunham, 1999). In 2000, the President of the United States asked the IT community to help close this digital divide for moral reasons and to ensure that the economy flourishes with the availability of skilled workers (Shewmake, 2000). This overview summarizes a five-phase service-learning project accomplished through a partnership between the University of Toledo and a local K-8 parochial/non-profit school. The students were primarily enrolled in a Systems Analysis, Design and Implementation course (SAD). This longitudinal project was undertaken to plan, design, and wire a network for the school and to assess and implement continuing and future computer needs.

pub.1063366481,10.11645/1.3.14,E-literacy and the grey digital divide: A review with recommendations,"Purpose: Reviews e-literacy in the context of Internet use and non-use by older people. Discusses the perceived barriers to Internet use and provides suggestions as to how the “grey” digital divide can be reduced.   Methodology: Reviews literature but draws heavily on survey research conducted in Derbyshire and Scotland.   Findings: Although the United Kingdom (UK) population is currently ageing and the use of the Internet amongst adults is increasing, current national statistics indicate that older people make up only a small proportion of those online, resulting in what can be aptly described as a “grey” digital divide. Existing literature indicates that older people are missing out on the enormous potential the Internet has to benefit their lives. Without access, older citizens are rapidly becoming disenfranchised. Perceived barriers to e-literacy include lack of interest, feeling too old, fear of new technology, lack of access to IT, lack of IT skills and experience, cost, concerns about security, and problems associated with disability.   Originality: Previous studies have examined Internet use by different sectors of the population, including older people. This paper brings these findings together and offers recommendations for increasing e-literacy in the context of Internet use among older people.",Journal of Information Literacy,2007,1,3,13,"Morris, Anne; Brading, Helena",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063366481,62,

In particular, we analyzed domain names registered by organizations in the non-profit sector.The penetration rate, calculated according to the number of organizations, was computed for various widely separated geographic levels (regions). A concentration analysis was performed in order to determine whether the geographical distribution of Internet use in Italy is less concentrated with respect to both the number of existing institutions and income distribution, suggesting a diffusive effect.Regression analysis was performed using demographic, social, economic and infrastructure indicators. Results show thata “social digital divide”exists, both in terms of geographical distribution (i.e., in macro-areas - Northern, Central, and Southern Italy - and at the regional level) and in terms of the legal status of the organizations, and that this digital divide will probably decrease in the future.",Scientometrics,2006,66,1,155-170,"Martinelli, Maurizio; Serrecchia, Irma; Serrecchia, Michela",Institute of Informatics and Telematics,Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035522906,2,"[Pohjola, Matti]|[ur.013107663011.00]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|133-144|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00063-4|pub.1017992418|101"

This requires defining sustainability in terms of supporting community organizations that provide social development and related content and services to the public, with support for core services, content development as well as technical access and networking. The authors further argue that governments, and in particular the federal government, has the primary role for providing sustainability funding at the community level to address the digital divide and development goals.   A conceptual approach is required that extends our understanding of the problem of the digital divide and sustainability to the everyday lived circumstances and needs of citizens and their local communities. Such an approach also permits us to consider sustainability in terms of being primarily a role for governments to provide funding to the community service organizations that provide services at the community level in order to address inequalities and under development. Funding should be used for technical services, the development and maintenance of core operations (staff, volunteers, overheads) and content services that can be accessed using communication technologies.",The Journal of Community Informatics,2005,1,2,,"Rideout, Vanda N; Reddick, Andrew J",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133390009,9,

The article focuses on a project; ‘Access Kumla’ initiated by the TUC of Sweden. The project is characterized as a very ambitious initiative to counteract the digital divide. Its four aims can be summarized as follows: providing citizens with high quality, low cost computers, creating a Community Network, providing knowledge about IT and improving local democracy with the help of IT. In our project the complex role of commercial activities and forces is emphasized. Firstly, they emphasize the importance of financial autonomy from a short-time as well as a long-time perspective. A further result is the surprisingly high degree of harmony or absence of conflict as regards the various aims and activities in the project.

pub.1041681461,10.1108/09593840810896028,Bringing lost sheep into the fold: questioning the discourse of the digital divide,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to critique the discourse of the digital divide and to propose ways of responding to digital inequalities.   Design/methodology/approach Illustrations of arguments are based on reviews of academic literature, projects reports, policy documents and research findings from the Penceil project, and are informed by critical theory. The research consisted of 47 semi‐structured interviews and action research involving designing an e‐literacy curriculum and running a course based on it.   Findings  A discourse of missed opportunities and “being left behind”, present in policy statements and popular media, leads to objectifying non‐users of information and communication technologies (ICT) as “others”. This discourse is often internalised by non‐users, but it does not necessarily lead to positive actions, leaving some feeling inadequate. So far initiatives seeking to address the digital divide have had moderate success. To respond to digital exclusion we need to oppose the unchecked spread of e‐services, and help non‐users of ICT to become users or (if they choose to) informed “ refusniks ”. Initiatives aiming to facilitate people's sustainable and meaningful use of ICT ought to draw on individual and community resources. A curriculum should be determined by learners' experiences and their expressions of needs, and go beyond IT skills.    Research limitations/implications The paper does not offer a comprehensive review of digital exclusion, concentrating instead on chosen problems and arguments. It is based on the UK experience, and thus more relevant to developed rather than developing countries.

Several projects aim at bringing information technologies to India with a belief in the transforming potential of IT. However, these technologies have created a digital and gender divide. In this article, attempts have been made to look into the digital divide and the constraints that women share by gender specifically in India. India is a multilateral, multilingual, and multireligious society with many subdivides based on region, ethnic groups, class, and caste. The digital divide and gender has become yet another component of this diversity. In India, women comprise 14% of the IT industry and 26% of the business processing outsourcing (BPO) workforce. The total workforce of IT and BPO is made up of approximately 70 million people (http://www.ciol.com). At the lower experience level (about 3 years), about 19% of the workforce comprises women. At senior levels, women constitute less than 6% of the workforce (http://www.dqqindia.com). This indicates that few manage to reach the top level, and the majority of them remain at lower levels as computer or data-entry operators. The gender gap in the digital divide is of great concern as it is directly linked to socioeconomic development. A major developmental issue of the coming decades will be the access and use of IT (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 1989). Policy makers of both industrial and developing countries have agreed that IT is one of the fastest growing industries and is likely to be the largest by the turn of the century (Kraemer, 1994).

pub.1052116527,10.1007/0-387-34588-4_4,American Discourses of the Digital Divide and Economic Development: A Sisyphean Order to Catch Up?,"Discourses about technology and its role in development have been constant themes within IFIP Working Group 8.2 (see the Barcelona proceedings—Wynn et al. 2002). In this paper, we examine how strands of discourse—institutionalized ways of thinking and speaking—shape debate about the digital divide and urban poverty in America. As research is widely esteemed as a wellspring of new ideas, we are especially interested in how discourses inform scholarly inquiry into urgent social problems. As information and communication technologies (ICTs) are increasingly hailed as drivers of industry and commerce, we believe that it will be instructive to examine economic development discourse, which strongly informs the case for bridging the digital divide.First, using Fairclough’s three-level framework for critical discourse analysis (CDA), we reveal that the discursive hegemony of economic development alarmingly constrains approaches to urban revitalization. Linking economic development to the digital divide, we show how the ongoing evolution of ICTs has become tightly linked to economic development. Both are discourses of equality in which those who lack money and technology are cast as needy problem sectors that will be left behind, failing to reap a host of benefits. Hence, there is an urgent call for these “have-nots” to catch up to models of prosperity embodied by the wealthy or technology savvy. We find fault with this discourse because it narrowly privileges money and technology, and raises alarm at their mere absence, while obscuring substantive needs—hunger, homelessness, ill health—of actual consequence. We propose that, in order truly to realize the potential of ICT, we must first reinvent discourse—discarding the mantra of catching up—and set in motion efforts to address self-determined needs, supported by ICT.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2006,208,,51-65,"Tu, Leslie; Kvasny, Lynette",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052116527,1,"[Mauws, Michael K.]|[ur.010525351320.21]|The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science|2000|36|2|229-244|10.1177/0021886300362007|pub.1006029196|19;[Harrison, Bennett; Glasmeler, Amy K.]|[ur.013504472011.20; ]|Economic Development Quarterly|1997|11|1|28-38|10.1177/089124249701100103|pub.1021638643|36;[Klein, Hans K.]|[]|The Information Society|1999|15|4|213-220|10.1080/019722499128376|pub.1025580979|79;[Bates, Timothy]|[ur.011640065667.90]|Economic Development Quarterly|1997|11|1|39-44|10.1177/089124249701100104|pub.1030243996|22;[Kvasny, Lynette; Truex, Duane]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.013072777061.80]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2001|66||399-414|10.1007/978-0-387-35489-7_27|pub.1030914962|22;[Yapa, Lakshman]|[ur.011577041672.87]|Annals of the American Association of Geographers|1996|86|4|707-728|10.1111/j.1467-8306.1996.tb01773.x|pub.1034841314|75;[Kvasny, Lynette; Yapa, Lakshman]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.011577041672.87]|Handbook of Critical Information Systems Research|2005||||10.4337/9781845426743.00024|pub.1037631474|2;[Moss, Jeremy]|[]|Ethics and Information Technology|2002|4|2|159-165|10.1023/a:1019983909305|pub.1037967441|28;[Fors, Martina; Moreno, Alfredo]|[; ]|Aslib Journal of Information Management|2002|54|3|198-206|10.1108/00012530210441746|pub.1048224053|27;[Thompson, Mark]|[ur.011565546373.37]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2003|110||347-373|10.1007/978-0-387-35634-1_17|pub.1048784539|26;[Loukaitou-Sideris, Anastasia]|[ur.016274526065.28]|Economic Development Quarterly|2000|14|2|165-181|10.1177/089124240001400204|pub.1049152503|25;[Gurstein, Michael]|[]|First Monday|2003|8|12||10.5210/fm.v8i12.1107|pub.1072710821|187;[Yu, Hong; Hou, Shuxun; Wu, Wenwen; Shang, Weilin; Zhang, Yichao; Liang, Hongying; Wang, Sheng; Sun, Fei; He, Lihua; Shen, Zhonghan; Huang, Qinghua]|[; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ]|Chinese Journal of Industrial Hygiene and Occupational Diseases|2002|20|1|1-4||pub.1076616953|5;[Avgerou, Chrisanthi]|[ur.012304503075.13]|The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries|2000|3|1|1-15|10.1002/j.1681-4835.2000.tb00021.x|pub.1099631951|49;[Yu, Peter K.]|[]|SSRN Electronic Journal|2002||||10.2139/ssrn.309841|pub.1102200366|20"

pub.1095232352,10.1109/fitce.2011.6133417,A new technical and economical approach for a new business model enabling broadband provisioning in DD areas,"The digital divide is mainly located in the so-called “market failure” areas because the high infrastructure costs and lack of market demand make difficult to find sustainable business models. This work identifies a possible solution by developing a technical and economic model characterized primarily by the reuse of existing infrastructures. This model enables ISPs to provide broadband services in digital divide areas through existing broadcasting infrastructures. The broadcaster could make available also a part of his transport network capacity to ISPs allowing them to carry traffic towards the Internet Exchange Point. The broadcasting sites are nationwide located providing radio and television services to the whole population mainly for the public service. In this scenario supply chain elements have been capitalized and some working hypothesis on the potential market have been taken. A possible model consists in the creation of an ecosystem where the facilities of the main national broadcaster, already present throughout the territory, can be reused. This work introduces an analysis of technical and economic impacts both in terms of cost and revenues. The adoption of a step-by-step deployment strategy, supported by the availability of the facilities already on the field, permits such ecosystem to start with minimum capex and gradually grow driven by demand. This approach would trigger a win-win mechanism between market and service providers in which all stakeholders involved in the value chain could both optimize the investment in infrastructure and minimize risk. In a market, potentially with low demand, the starting of mechanisms able to facilitate risk-sharing enables the services offering to such part of the population that would remain in the digital divide. Finally this approach allows the interception of those market segments where the traditional business models are not applicable also implying the digital divide reduction according to European Digital Agenda intentions.","2011 50th FITCE Congress - ""ICT: Bridging an Ever Shifting Digital Divide""",2011,,,1-6,"Braccini, Giuseppe; Aliberti, Luigi Maria; Leo, Marco; Vari, Marco",Radiolabs; University of Rome Tor Vergata,Italy; Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095232352,0,"[Pereira, João Paulo Ribeiro; Ferreira, Pedro]|[ur.014442260351.39; ur.015044407653.65]|2009 5th International Conference on Testbeds and Research Infrastructures for the Development of Networks & Communities and Workshops|2009|||1-7|10.1109/tridentcom.2009.4976221|pub.1093392604|9"

Former Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Larry Irving, said the following in his introduction to “Falling Through the Net,” the 1999 Department of Commerce Study on the digital divide (the divide between those with access to new information technologies and those without): [“The digital divide” is now one of America’s leading economic and civil rights issues] (US Department of Commerce, 1999a).The basis for the secretary’s assertion can be found in US telecommunications policy. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is within the US Department of Commerce and functions as the US president’s principal advisory body on telecommunications policy (US Department of Commerce, 1995). A fundamental premise of US telecommunications policy is the notion that all Americans should have access to affordable telephone service (universal service). Prior to this point, the most commonly used measure of universal service was “telephone penetration” or the percentage of all households in America that have a telephone on the premises (US Department of Commerce, 1995). However, significant growth in personal computer ownership and Internet access (see Chaps. 6 and 7) suggested the need to go beyond telephone penetration as a metric of universal access (US Department of Commerce, 1995). To accomplish this goal, the NTIA contracted with the Census Bureau to include questions regarding computer/modem ownership and usage in the Bureau’s Current Population Survey, and to cross tab this information via several geodemographic characteristics (US Department of Commerce, 1995). This chapter will discuss the evidence and evolution of the digital divide in the US.",eHealth Solutions for Healthcare Disparities,2008,,,66-71,"Gibbons, Michael Christopher",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1020238179,1,"[Eng, Thomas R]|[]|American Journal of Preventive Medicine|2004|26|3|237-242|10.1016/j.amepre.2003.12.004|pub.1019920063|38"

In this paper, the author analyzes the experiences of six Master of Education (M.Ed.) pre-service teachers learning to integrate ICTs into their practice. These case studies demonstrate how novice teachers’ learning processes can be impacted by the unequal distribution of the temporal, material, mental, social, and cultural resources available (van Dijk, 2005). A number of pedagogical and curricular recommendations for the M.Ed. program are then provided.",International Journal of Information Communication Technologies and Human Development,2010,2,4,27-41,"Bangou, Francis",University of Ottawa,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021109616,1,"[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|New Media & Society|2004|6|3|341-362|10.1177/1461444804042519|pub.1003317453|630;[]|[]||2007||||10.1007/978-3-531-90519-8|pub.1003867661|8;[Hassani, Sara Nephew]|[]|Poetics|2006|34|4-5|250-272|10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.007|pub.1006455939|90;[Stevenson, Olivia]|[ur.013146625473.27]|Technology Pedagogy and Education|2008|17|2|115-130|10.1080/14759390802098615|pub.1009141248|10;[van Dijk, Jan A.G.M.]|[ur.016570250333.33]|Poetics|2006|34|4-5|221-235|10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004|pub.1014130665|741;[PUTNAM, RALPH T.; BORKO, HILDA]|[ur.014665655737.70; ur.01170731554.59]|Educational Researcher|2000|29|1|4-15|10.3102/0013189x029001004|pub.1014603914|1707;[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|Poetics|2006|34|4-5|273-292|10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.003|pub.1017218946|154;[Yu, Liangzhi]|[ur.011761531432.32]|Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|2006|38|4|229-252|10.1177/0961000606070600|pub.1028593097|128;[Hohlfeld, Tina N.; Ritzhaupt, Albert D.; Barron, Ann E.; Kemker, Kate]|[ur.010064775107.13; ur.014575520403.68; ur.014202112773.66; ur.07762323777.32]|Computers & Education|2008|51|4|1648-1663|10.1016/j.compedu.2008.04.002|pub.1030119827|116;[Mueller, Julie; Wood, Eileen; Willoughby, Teena; Ross, Craig; Specht, Jacqueline]|[ur.011473074631.55; ur.0674715512.23; ur.01010621147.99; ; ur.01030533702.45]|Computers & Education|2008|51|4|1523-1537|10.1016/j.compedu.2008.02.003|pub.1032744582|243;[Livingstone, Sonia; Helsper, Ellen]|[ur.014400337707.47; ur.014711443745.96]|New Media & Society|2007|9|4|671-696|10.1177/1461444807080335|pub.1041353721|639;[Kim, Eunjin; Lee, Byungtae; Menon, Nirup M.]|[ur.015500051246.48; ur.012105346327.82; ur.015046650305.00]|Government Information Quarterly|2009|26|2|377-386|10.1016/j.giq.2008.11.004|pub.1043619915|15;[Johnson, Karen E.]|[]|Teaching and Teacher Education|1994|10|4|439-452|10.1016/0742-051x(94)90024-8|pub.1046275512|207;[Vannatta, Rachel A.; Nancy, Fordham]|[ur.07542034527.72; ]|Journal of Research on Technology in Education|2004|36|3|253-271|10.1080/15391523.2004.10782415|pub.1046877384|158;[Roe, Keith; Broos, Agnetha]|[ur.015545261353.74; ur.01200645422.06]|Communications|2005|30|1|91-96|10.1515/comm.2005.30.1.91|pub.1048432796|19;[FREEMAN, DONALD; JOHNSON, KAREN E.]|[ur.010501236627.42; ur.015600136717.11]|TESOL Quarterly|1998|32|3|397-417|10.2307/3588114|pub.1048495617|505;[Eteokleous, Nikleia]|[ur.07456771603.10]|Computers & Education|2008|51|2|669-686|10.1016/j.compedu.2007.07.004|pub.1048715282|87;[Noce, Anthony A.; McKeown, Larry]|[; ]|Government Information Quarterly|2008|25|3|462-476|10.1016/j.giq.2007.04.006|pub.1052101707|32;[EGBERT, JOY; YANG, YU-FENG]|[ur.012616225703.56; ]|ReCALL|2004|16|2|280-291|10.1017/s0958344004000321|pub.1053757411|13;[Hoffman, Donna L.; Novak, Thomas P.; Schlosser, Ann]|[; ; ]|Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|2006|5|3|0-0|10.1111/j.1083-6101.2000.tb00341.x|pub.1061923611|135;[Bangou, Francis]|[ur.011164353567.35]|Alsic|2006||Vol. 9|145-160|10.4000/alsic.290|pub.1071822288|10;[Tognozzi, Elissa]|[ur.07430552216.61]|Italica|2001|78|4|486|10.2307/3656077|pub.1102685184|6;[]|[]|Technology and Social Inclusion|2004||||10.7551/mitpress/6699.001.0001|pub.1110624278|439"

A qualitative research was undertaken based on the opinion of key informers from the sectors that constitute the e-gov in the country: public sector, private sector, third sector and academy. Content analysis was used to verify the interviewees' perceptions about the e-gov policy, using the Atlas.ti software to help with conceptual ordering of collected data. Results show that the only aspect that could be viewed as institutionalized in the e-government would be the relation between the State and the third sector in the digital divide policy.

The limited interaction between users and information security managers results in a lack of understanding for the other's point of view.

This fact may easily lead to so called ‘digital divide’ unless any special support is given to the users with few knowledge. We have already proposed a new concept of ‘universal multimedia access’ intended to narrow the digital divide by providing appropriate multimedia expressions according to users’ (mental and physical) abilities, computer facilities, and network environments.

This framework can serve as a guide to national and NGO (non–governmental) organizations to improve access and utilization of ICT and reduce the digital divide.",First Monday,2007,,,,"Peslak, Alan R.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072709139,0,
pub.1012293204,10.1016/j.infoecopol.2008.02.002,"Financial development, the structure of capital markets, and the global digital divide","This paper examines the extent to which financial development and financial structure may explain cross-country diffusion of information communication technology (ICT). Using panel data for 76 emerging and advanced countries for the period 1990–2003, it finds that credit and stock market development tends to foster ICT diffusion, but financial structure does not appear to have any significant relationship with it. The conclusions, which are consistent with what theory might predict, highlight the role of financial development in the market for knowledge-based products. The finding that financial development is an important determinant of ICT diffusion implies that countries with underdeveloped financial markets may sink even further to the information-poor and noncommunicating side of the global digital divide.",Information Economics and Policy,2008,20,2,208-227,"Yartey, Charles Amo",International Monetary Fund,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1012293204,43,"[Quibria, M.G; Ahmed, Shamsun N; Tschang, Ted; Reyes-Macasaquit, Mari-Len]|[ur.015764721413.10; ur.010654611213.10; ur.012247552213.80; ur.015235454213.44]|Journal of Asian Economics|2003|13|6|811-825|10.1016/s1049-0078(02)00186-0|pub.1000815131|147;[Kiiski, Sampsa; Pohjola, Matti]|[ur.012603406201.20; ur.013107663011.00]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|297-310|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00071-3|pub.1001159834|314;[Dasgupta, Susmita; Lall, Somik; Wheeler, David]|[ur.07725533447.34; ur.016411736217.36; ]|Oxford Development Studies|2005|33|2|229-243|10.1080/13600810500137889|pub.1002252553|85;[Wong, Poh-Kam]|[ur.015333364767.86]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|167-187|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00065-8|pub.1002363516|85;[Singh, Ajit]|[]|The Economic Journal|1997|107|442|771-782|10.1111/j.1468-0297.1997.tb00042.x|pub.1003810663|287;[STEINMUELLER, W.

This approach typically considers information technology a homogeneous set of technologies. In this chapter, we will break this assumption establishing different subsets of information technologies according to their impact on the task productivity and the firm’s demand for high skilled labour. This new focus reveals that depending on the information technology used by the firm to perform a given task, the demand for high skilled and low skilled workers may vary and consequently their wages and income, producing in some cases a new and till now unobserved digital divide.",Handbook of Research on Overcoming Digital Divides,2010,,,423-438,"Ferro, Enrico; Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Gil-Garcia, J.

Some effects can be observed by analysts directly from the results produced by the system itself. However, there exists effects that may be hidden from the analyst direct view-point. One of those effects is the expert intermediation. This phenomenon is launched as a direct consequence of the system design, and originates a “new elite” within the society. It also generates negative externalities for citizens, and creates an artificial digital divide, which is far from the democratic and egalitarian goals of e-government.

They develop and employ a new methodology and metrics to examine and assess the digital divide in information uses, looking at the extent of political searches and their accuracy and variety. The findings indicate that some countries, particularly Germany, Russia, and Ireland, display greater accuracy of search terms, diversity of information uses, and sociopolitical concern. Also, in many English-speaking and Western countries most popular searches were about entertainment, implying a certain gap within these countries between the few who search for economic and political information and the many who do not.",The Information Society,2010,26,1,17-37,"Segev, Elad; Ahituv, Niv",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,Israel,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1000562500,24,"[Bawden, David]|[]|Journal of Documentation|2001|57|2|218-259|10.1108/eum0000000007083|pub.1000197126|456;[Jansen, Bernard J.; Spink, Amanda]|[ur.013743201161.62; ur.0757541764.16]|Information Processing & Management|2006|42|1|248-263|10.1016/j.ipm.2004.10.007|pub.1001417284|503;[Cho, Junghoo; Roy, Sourashis]|[ur.011541213737.42; ur.011633050637.57]|Proceedings of the 13th conference on World Wide Web  - WWW '04|2004|||20-29|10.1145/988672.988676|pub.1004417799|157;[Palmer, Allen W.; Carter, Edward L.]|[; ]|Communication Law and Policy|2006|11|1|1-34|10.1207/s15326926clp1101_1|pub.1004553795|14;[Webster, James G.; Lin, Shu-Fang]|[; ]|Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media|2002|46|1|1-12|10.1207/s15506878jobem4601_1|pub.1006529782|41;[Bar‐Ilan, Judit]|[ur.012671172661.44]|Annual Review of Information Science and Technology|2005|38|1|231-288|10.1002/aris.1440380106|pub.1010800945|72;[Silverstein, Craig; Marais, Hannes; Henzinger, Monika; Moricz, Michael]|[ur.013324751437.88; ; ur.011606157736.40; ]|ACM SIGIR Forum|1999|33|1|6-12|10.1145/331403.331405|pub.1012258095|732;[Jansen, Bernard J.; Spink, Amanda; Saracevic, Tefko]|[ur.013743201161.62; ur.0757541764.16; ur.010116255617.55]|Information Processing & Management|2000|36|2|207-227|10.1016/s0306-4573(99)00056-4|pub.1021151939|833;[Segev, Elad; Ahituv, Niv; Barzilai‐Nahon, Karine]|[ur.013223352225.65; ur.014315160703.51; ur.014613452655.40]|Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|2007|12|4|1269-1297|10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00373.x|pub.1022525809|12;[Holtz-Bacha, Pippa Norris Christina]|[]|Political Communication|2001|18|2|123-140|10.1080/105846001750322943|pub.1024209094|81;[Webber, Sheila; Johnston, Bill]|[ur.07476034211.17; ur.012755531620.14]|Journal of Information Science|2000|26|6|381-397|10.1177/016555150002600602|pub.1024572110|187;[Lance, G.

The survey shows that birthplace has great positive effects on the time of Internet usage among students. And the motivation of Internet based on uses and gratification theory has great positive effects on the index of Internet usage about studying and working.

pub.1095367870,10.1109/ipcc.2002.1049117,International IT Implementation Projects: Policy and Cultural Considerations,"Information technology has become a crucial component for economic and educational development. While in recent years an increasing number of people have gained access to information technology, the latest research indicates that a digital divide remains. Although researchers have moved past the belief that providing access will be the only step required to equalize populations' engagement with information technology, there is still very limited understanding of what factors are truly operative in maintaining the digital divide. What these studies increasingly show, however, is that culture and public policy are elements that contribute to a persistent digital divide. This presentation will focus on a case study of IT adoption in order to illustrate the importance of generating a more complex understanding of how culture and policy can influence usage. The region examined as part of this presentation is Central Asia, with a particular focus on Uzbekistan. Based on ethnographic and interview data, the presentation will discuss early Internet adoption and usage patterns in Uzbekistan in order to illustrate that the uses to which diverse populations put technology is dependent on the interaction between cultural elements and public policies in place. Uzbekistan is an excellent test bed for such questions because of its early stage of Internet development and its relative isolation from Western cultural elements.",Proceedings.

pub.1095115038,10.1109/hicss.2010.196,Explaining the Global Digital Divide: The Impact of Public Policy Initiatives on Digital Opportunity and ICT Development,"The development of affordable information and communication technologies (TCl's) over the past 25 years has created an environment for people across the globe to have greater access to telecommunication and Internet services. Much of the previous research suggests that these technological advances have mostly exacerbated existing inequalities between developed and developing nations and created new inequalities within societies between the information rich and poor. There seems to be very little research, however, that provides comprehensive explanations for the global digital divide and, in particular, the impact of national public policy initiatives that seek to expand access to TCl's. Most of these studies have tended to be either largely descriptive, qualitative case studies, or quantitative analyses that have had a very narrow concept of ICT s. Our research examines the digital divide by analyzing the impact of national policies in the form of strategic planning, regulation and investment on the International Telecommunications Union's Digital Opportunity Index and ICT access and use indicators in approximately 150 countries. Our multivariate regression analysis shows that when controlling for measures of economic, political, social and educational development, there is greater digital opportunity and greater overall technology adoption and use in countries that have competition to provide basic telecommunication services and make a higher financial investment in ICT development.",2010 43rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,2010,,,1-10,"Yates, David J; Gulati, Girish J. “Jeff”; Tawileh, Anas",Bentley University; Cardiff University,United States; United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095115038,8,"[Meng, Qingxuan; Li, Mingzhi]|[; ]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|275-295|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00070-1|pub.1000075081|76;[Schech, Susanne]|[ur.015014714225.57]|Journal of International Development|2002|14|1|13-23|10.1002/jid.870|pub.1001709424|84;[Beilock, Richard; Dimitrova, Daniela V]|[ur.014323447013.67; ur.014237167607.22]|Telecommunications Policy|2003|27|3-4|237-252|10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00100-3|pub.1010780120|140;[Sreekumar, T.T.]|[ur.013621023657.19]|Media Culture & Society|2007|29|6|869-889|10.1177/0163443707081692|pub.1012641691|36;[van Dijk, Jan A.G.M.]|[ur.016570250333.33]|Poetics|2006|34|4-5|221-235|10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004|pub.1014130665|741;[Qureshil, Sajda; Kamal, Mehruz; Wolcott, Peter]|[ur.015701064747.90; ur.010214270466.58; ur.012113306637.48]|International Journal of E-Business Research|2009|5|1|117-140|10.4018/jebr.2009010106|pub.1026582597|32;[Zhao, Hongxin; Kim, Seung; Suh, Taewon; Du, Jianjun]|[ur.012127022247.01; ur.07676611102.37; ur.011271552102.18; ur.014440220447.51]|Journal of Global Information Management|2007|15|2|28-55|10.4018/jgim.2007040102|pub.1029296437|65;[Weaver, David H.; Buddenbaum, Judith M.; Fair, Jo Ellen]|[; ; ur.013063646017.83]|Journal of Communication|1985|35|2|104-117|10.1111/j.1460-2466.1985.tb02237.x|pub.1041164226|35;[Robison, Kristopher Kyle; Crenshaw, Edward M.]|[ur.015334225726.82; ur.013127613411.61]|Social Science Research|2002|31|3|334-363|10.1016/s0049-089x(02)00004-2|pub.1047972798|76;[Forestier, Emmanuel; Grace, Jeremy; Kenny, Charles]|[; ur.07740001375.80; ur.010254167455.56]|Telecommunications Policy|2002|26|11|623-646|10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00061-7|pub.1050411674|78;[Avgerou, Chrisanthi]|[ur.012304503075.13]|Information Technology for Development|1998|8|1|15-28|10.1080/02681102.1998.9525288|pub.1050482093|93;[Pick, James B.; Azari, Rasool]|[ur.013153730431.66; ur.016636325747.37]|Information Technology for Development|2008|14|2|91-115|10.1002/itdj.20095|pub.1051270561|91;[Fuchs, Christian; Horak, Eva]|[ur.011011325200.42; ]|Telematics and Informatics|2008|25|2|99-116|10.1016/j.tele.2006.06.004|pub.1053315652|197;[Chinn, M.

pub.1001896093,10.2202/1538-0645.1263,Race and the Digital Divide,"In recent years, a plethora of public and private programs in the United States have been created to close the ""Digital Divide."" Interestingly, however, we know very little about the underlying causes of racial differences in rates of computer and Internet access. In this paper, I use data from the Computer and Internet Use Supplement to the August 2000 Current Population Survey (CPS) to explore this question. Estimates from the CPS indicate that Mexican-Americans are roughly one-half as likely to own a computer and one-third as likely to have Internet access at home as whites. The black home computer rate is 59 percent of the white rate and the black home Internet access rate is 51 percent of the white rate. Using Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions, I find that racial differences in education, income and occupation contribute substantially to the black/white and Mexican-American/white gaps in home computer and Internet access rates. The digital divide between races, however, is not simply an ""income divide"" as income differences explain only 10 to 30 percent of the gaps in access to technology. I do not find evidence that price or school differences are responsible for the remaining gaps. I find some evidence, however, that language barriers may be important in explaining low rates of computer and Internet access among Mexican-Americans.",Contributions in Economic Analysis & Policy,2004,3,1,,"Fairlie, Robert W",University of California System,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001896093,143,

We ask whether a similar divide exists for internet usage. Using a survey of 18,439 Americans, we find that high-income, educated people were more likely to have adopted the internet by December 2001. However, conditional on adoption, low-income, less-educated people spend more time online. We examine four possible reasons for this pattern: (1) differences in the opportunity cost of leisure time, (2) differences in the usefulness of online activities, (3) differences in the amount of leisure time, and (4) selection. Our evidence suggests this pattern is best explained by differences in the opportunity cost of leisure time.

pub.1093311574,10.1109/icaict.2009.5372509,E-INCLUSION FOR BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN TURKEY,"Development of an information society is an important priority for many countries today. Governments are taking steps to give opportunity to every citizen to participate fully in the information society. However, every person cannot benefit from the information and communication technologies equally because of the inequalities in terms of economic, geographic and other related factors. Digital Divide is described as the inequality between individuals, companies and nations from differing classes in terms of access and use of information and communication technologies (OECD, 2001). E-Inclusion, which is described as being included into information society, aims to terminate the risks of digital divide. It refers to realize an inclusive information society, that is, an “information society for all”. The aim is to enable every person who so wishes to fully participate in the information society. The Council of the European Union have been taking steps towards a highly inclusive information society in recent years. In this paper we aim to determine and identify possible policy actions, structures and applications to achieve a fully inclusive information society in Turkey which is a candidate country to membership of the European Union. By this way, it is aimed to increase the visibility of e-inclusion in Turkey and to raise the level of political and stakeholder commitment. Current official documents and government structures are investigated from the Institutional E-Government Communication Directorate and related public and private institutions are interviewed.

pub.1045832991,10.1007/s10660-007-9006-5,Explaining differences in access to home computers and the Internet: A comparison of Latino groups to other ethnic and racial groups,"Abstract A report by the U.S. Department of Commerce notes that Internet use among African-Americans and Latinos is growing at a substantially faster rate than Internet use among whites or Asians suggesting that the so-called “Digital Divide” may be disappearing. Using data from the Computer and Internet Use Supplement to the October 2003 Current Population Survey (CPS), I explore this hypothesis. I find large disparities in home computer and Internet access across major racial and detailed Latino groups that do not appear as though they will disappear soon. I also find that ethnic and racial disparities in home computer and Internet access rates are larger for children than for adults. The results are mixed for other measurable dimensions of the digital divide. Using regression models and special decomposition techniques, I find that differences in income and education explain part, but not all, of the ethnic and racial disparities in home computer and Internet access. Language is also found to be an important determinant of home computer and Internet access even after controlling for education, family income and immigrant status. Spanish-speaking Latinos have strikingly low rates of computer ownership and home Internet access.

pub.1032310723,10.1108/17506161111131195,Citizen interaction and e‐government,"Purpose This paper aims to examine citizen interaction with e‐government using three e‐participation models. The two major research questions of this paper are: what is the current level of e‐participation in the USA?; and what factors explain why citizens participate in online government?   Design/methodology/approach Survey evidence of citizens in the USA and their use of e‐participation is examined using quantitative methods.   Findings Citizens were most likely to use e‐participation for management activities. Citizens were much less likely to use the internet for more advanced consultative and participatory activities. Using regression analysis, factors such as demand by citizens for e‐government, the digital divide, and political factors influenced the level of e‐participation.   Research limitations/implications The results of this study imply that governments should do more to stimulate demand for e‐government, address issues of the digital divide, and provide for more open and transparent government. A limitation of this study is its focus on e‐participation through a survey instrument, which does not consider all possible forms of e‐participation.   Practical implications For e‐participation to blossom, governments should do more to promote citizens' demand for e‐government, bridge the digital divide, and promote more open and transparent government.   Originality/value Existing research on e‐participation has focused on theory building and case studies; this paper provides empirical evidence, through a survey, of the level of e‐participation and factors that promote e‐participation.",Transforming Government People Process and Policy,2011,5,2,167-184,"Reddick, Christopher G.",The University of Texas at San Antonio,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032310723,70,"[Norris, Donald; Norris, Donald F.]|[; ]|Current Issues and Trends in E-Government Research|2007|||163-179|10.4018/978-1-59904-283-1.ch008|pub.1000594407|22;[Bélanger, France; Carter, Lemuria]|[ur.07347634165.87; ur.010501313522.42]|The Journal of Strategic Information Systems|2008|17|2|165-176|10.1016/j.jsis.2007.12.002|pub.1001223371|685;[Kolsaker, Ailsa; Lee‐Kelley, Liz]|[ur.016622131027.01; ur.014047374707.20]|International Journal of Public Sector Management|2008|21|7|723-738|10.1108/09513550810904532|pub.1002239686|105;[Carter, Lemuria]|[ur.010501313522.42]|Transforming Government People Process and Policy|2008|2|3|147-161|10.1108/17506160810902167|pub.1002981871|78;[Coursey, David; Norris, Donald F.]|[ur.012630511431.13; ur.012356021140.87]|Public Administration Review|2008|68|3|523-536|10.1111/j.1540-6210.2008.00888.x|pub.1005974432|348;[Millard, Jeremy]|[ur.014254131275.79]|International Journal of Electronic Government Research|2006|2|2|49-58|10.4018/jegr.2006040103|pub.1006272834|22;[Pina, Vicente; Torres, Lourdes; Royo, Sonia]|[ur.010270012765.21; ur.015066770410.48; ur.012002574205.86]|Financial Accountability and Management|2010|26|1|3-20|10.1111/j.1468-0408.2009.00488.x|pub.1007671820|70;[Akman, Ibrahim; Yazici, Ali; Mishra, Alok; Arifoglu, Ali]|[ur.013074555647.64; ur.016524311475.34; ur.010276651355.44; ur.012727113212.59]|Government Information Quarterly|2005|22|2|239-257|10.1016/j.giq.2004.12.001|pub.1011837196|172;[Morgeson, Forrest V.; Mithas, Sunil]|[ur.011567552640.06; ur.015204761316.55]|Public Administration Review|2009|69|4|740-752|10.1111/j.1540-6210.2009.02021.x|pub.1012281794|77;[Anthopoulos, Leo G.; Siozos, Panagiotis; Tsoukalas, Ioannis A.]|[ur.010035032523.43; ur.014622215543.00; ur.014723576313.88]|Government Information Quarterly|2007|24|2|353-376|10.1016/j.giq.2006.07.018|pub.1012580241|132;[Helbig, Natalie; Gil-García, J.

Besides, the World Telecommunication Development Conference, WTDC-02, Resolution 37 (Istanbul, 2002), recognized, among other issues, that there is need to show clearly what the digital divide is, where it occurs and who suffers from it, considering that, even with all the developments occurring in the recent years, in many developing countries telecommunications are still not affordable to the majority of the people.

Besides the general issues of digital libraries such as publishing, quality control, authentication, networking, and information retrieval, Indonesia also faces other issues — namely, the digital divide — in designing and implementing the Indonesian DLN Network. This paper describes the basic design of the Network that enables it to handle the typical problems encountered in a developing country's digital library network, such as internet accessibility, bandwidth capacity, and network delays. Also described are the experiences in implementing the Network, which currently has 14 successfully connected partners and more than 15 partners in the process of developing their digital library servers.",The International Information & Library Review,2002,34,2,153-174,"Fahmi, Ismail",Bandung Institute of Technology,Indonesia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038636352,2,

There are great disparities, known as digital divide between developed countries and developing countries in terms of electronic resource funding, availability, and accessibility. DL, together with the information retrieval (IR) system, is believed to be an effective way to mend the gap of digital divide. This paper will employ a real case to discuss the significance of developing a national level of digital library for pre-university schools of Albania, the challenges of designing such information system both economically and technologically, and considerations of designing the digital library.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2011,6966,,341-347,"Li, Xiaohua; Sula, Ardiana",Sacred Heart University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032609271,1,"[Adams, Anne; Blandford, Ann]|[ur.013614224041.71; ur.012201125115.32]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2002|2555||392-403|10.1007/3-540-36227-4_44|pub.1004584917|8;[Witten, Ian H.; Loots, Michel; Trujillo, Maria F.; Bainbridge, David]|[ur.014370140227.76; ur.014225523405.19; ur.015023104005.33; ur.010652771027.75]|The Electronic Library|2002|20|1|7-13|10.1108/02640470210418218|pub.1025314891|20;[Clark, Melody; Gomez, Ricardo]|[ur.011114437336.30; ur.016151455331.08]|Proceedings of the 2011 iConference|2011|||181-188|10.1145/1940761.1940786|pub.1030280000|6;[Witten, Ian H.; Bainbridge, David]|[ur.014370140227.76; ur.010652771027.75]|Proceedings of the 2007 conference on Digital libraries  - JCDL '07|2007|||147-156|10.1145/1255175.1255204|pub.1036920868|15;[Spasser, Mark A.]|[ur.0621063144.43]|Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)|2002|11|1-2|81-110|10.1023/a:1015288305397|pub.1040268537|33;[Lalmas, Mounia; Bhat, Ramnath; Frank, Maxine; Frohlich, David; Jones, Matt]|[ur.012425422637.58; ur.016305453407.66; ur.012573124103.15; ur.015245607757.35; ur.01244021620.20]|Proceedings of the 30th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval - SIGIR '07|2007|||741-742|10.1145/1277741.1277886|pub.1044325856|6;[Kuny, Terry; Cleveland, Gary]|[; ]|IFLA Journal|1998|24|2|107-113|10.1177/034003529802400205|pub.1046857162|15;[Witten, Ian H.; Bainbridge, David; Boddie, Stefan J.]|[ur.014370140227.76; ur.010652771027.75; ur.015071401113.36]|Proceedings of the first ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital libraries  - JCDL '01|2001|||94-103|10.1145/379437.379458|pub.1051291483|22;[Ferreira, Sueli Mara; Pithan, Denise Nunes]|[ur.013157613023.20; ur.016547073006.07]|Digital Library Perspectives|2005|21|4|311-323|10.1108/10650750510631695|pub.1053680217|29;[Norman, Donald A.; Draper, Stephen W.]|[]|User Centered System Design|1986||||10.1201/b15703|pub.1108496317|1661"

Data from '2008 Korean Internet usage behavior' were used to conduct logistic regression analysis. The findings show that there are significant socio-economic(age, gender, educational attainment, employment situation, and Internet access type) disparity in Internet access(Internet access at home, broadband Internet access). Also socio-economic variables enter in as statistically significant in most specifications for Internet use intensity (Intensive internet use, frequent internet use, less frequent internet use). The gender, household income and education attainment explanations for large differential in Internet use intensity are generally very similar. It is shown that age, education attainment and household income level cause a large digital divide on Internet service use(information use, communication and community use, e-commerce use, Internet banking use).",Journal of the Korea Academia-Industrial cooperation Society,2011,12,12,5601-5613,"Ju, Young-Wan; Kim, Yoo-Jung; Cho, Chang-Hyung",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037627622,1,"[Noh, Yong-Hwan; 김원중; 김정언]|[; ; ]|The e-Business Studies|2009|10|4|319-350|10.15719/geba.10.4.200911.319|pub.1037137974|3;[Resende, Marcelo; Façanha, Luı́s Otávio]|[ur.010647117317.17; ]|Information Economics and Policy|2005|17|1|1-12|10.1016/j.infoecopol.2003.11.001|pub.1042645245|20;[Vicente, María Rosalía; López, Ana Jesús]|[ur.014046005743.15; ur.015547610463.36]|Telecommunications Policy|2011|35|3|220-237|10.1016/j.telpol.2010.12.013|pub.1044992737|140"

Recently, as the Internet utilization rate has increased every year, the usage of PCs by elderly people has also increased in Japan. However, the digital divide between elderly people and PC beginners has widened. To eliminate this digital divide, we consider improving the users’ operability and visibility as our goal. We propose a new hemispherical human-computer-interface device for PCs, which integrates a hemispherical sub-display and a pointing device. Then we evaluate the interface device in terms of its effectiveness of operability and visibility. As seen from the analyses of a subjective evaluation, our interface device obtained good impressions results for both elderly people and PC beginners.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2011,6762,,436-445,"Ike, Shinichi; Yokoyama, Saya; Yamanishi, Yuya; Matsuuchi, Naohisa; Shimamura, Kazunori; Yamaguchi, Takumi; Shiba, Haruya",Kochi National College of Technology; Kochi University of Technology,Japan; Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001119908,0,

In addition, a medium effect size was found for the difference in means between the perceptions of the students with respect to the item that access to the library can be improved via the Internet in rural areas. Furthermore, the results indicate that there is a medium effect size for the difference in means between the perceptions of the students with regard to the item that social service applications of the Internet are crucial in rural areas.

pub.1063751248,10.1177/0165551511426246,The divided views of the information and digital divides: A call for integrative theories of information inequality,"This article defines information inequality as multifaceted disparity between individuals, communities or nations in mobilizing society’s information resources for the benefit of their lives and development. It then examines related research from a wide range of disciplines that focuses either on information inequality in general or on its specific forms, e.g. information poverty, information divide, knowledge gap and digital divide. It shows that it is possible to identify a number of clusters of information inequality research according to their theoretical perspectives, and that these perspectives have inherited to a great extent the traditional divisions of social sciences between structure vs agency, society vs individuals and objectivism vs subjectivism. Following earlier calls for greater dialogue between divisions of related research, this article goes further to call for integrative theorizing of information inequality in the way exemplified by Bourdieu’s research on social inequality.",Journal of Information Science,2011,37,6,660-679,"Yu, Liangzhi",Nankai University,China,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063751248,29,"[Stevenson, Siobhan]|[]|The Information Society|2009|25|1|1-22|10.1080/01972240802587539|pub.1000580777|54;[Caidi, Nadia; Allard, Danielle; Luk, Chiu]|[ur.07426543541.39; ur.016536252357.37; ur.015646665125.48]|Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|2008|44|1|1-5|10.1002/meet.1450440377|pub.1000831901|1;[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|New Media & Society|2004|6|3|341-362|10.1177/1461444804042519|pub.1003317453|630;[Adams, Matthew]|[ur.014474137051.07]|Sociology|2006|40|3|511-528|10.1177/003803850663672|pub.1004828381|258;[Mansell, Robin]|[ur.013665171232.89]|Current Sociology|2002|50|3|407-426|10.1177/0011392102050003007|pub.1004956599|130;[Bishop, Ann Peterson; Bruce, Bertram]|[ur.014126753237.06; ur.0616725154.36]|Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2006|31|6|6-10|10.1002/bult.2005.1720310603|pub.1005181798|18;[Cartier, Carolyn; Castells, Manuel; Qiu, Jack Linchuan]|[ur.012023731605.68; ur.013712011421.61; ur.015304752421.41]|Studies in Comparative International Development|2005|40|2|9-34|10.1007/bf02686292|pub.1005539857|71;[Spink, Amanda; Cole, Charles]|[ur.0757541764.16; ur.013252501347.32]|Library & Information Science Research|2001|23|1|45-65|10.1016/s0740-8188(00)00067-0|pub.1006289377|87;[Lievrouw, Leah A.; Farb, Sharon E.]|[ur.015617015543.53; ur.015052574702.41]|Annual Review of Information Science and Technology|2005|37|1|499-540|10.1002/aris.1440370112|pub.1007100288|79;[Couldry, Nick]|[]|Ethics and Information Technology|2003|5|2|89-97|10.1023/a:1024916618904|pub.1007671680|27;[Wong, Yu Cheung; Law, Chi Kwong; Fung, John Yat Chu; Lam, Jolie Chi Yee]|[ur.01071466665.44; ur.01067412655.34; ur.011040744515.03; ur.013622756130.16]|Journal of Technology in Human Services|2009|27|1|57-78|10.1080/15228830802459135|pub.1012688304|16;[Haythornthwaite, Caroline]|[ur.013446276022.87]|Library & Information Science Research|1996|18|4|323-342|10.1016/s0740-8188(96)90003-1|pub.1013037988|526;[Goldfarb, Avi; Prince, Jeff]|[ur.0636245456.94; ]|Information Economics and Policy|2008|20|1|2-15|10.1016/j.infoecopol.2007.05.001|pub.1014279471|257;[Dutch, Martin; Muddiman, Dave]|[ur.015453050037.09; ur.011072205037.30]|Libri|2001|51|4|183-194|10.1515/libr.2001.183|pub.1017253991|22;[Robison, Kristopher K.; Crenshaw, Edward M.]|[ur.015334225726.82; ur.013127613411.61]|Sociological Inquiry|2010|80|1|34-62|10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00315.x|pub.1017320723|26;[GAZIANO, CECILIE]|[ur.011707047025.50]|Communication Research|1983|10|4|447-486|10.1177/009365083010004003|pub.1018914207|134;[Chatman, Elfreda A.]|[ur.013651330727.81]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|1986|37|6|377-386|10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(198611)37:6<377::aid-asi2>3.0.co;2-c|pub.1019754109|50;[Valentine, Gill; Holloway, Sarah; Bingham, Nick]|[ur.010513355511.85; ur.011003521457.11; ur.0773262460.41]|Antipode|2002|34|2|296-315|10.1111/1467-8330.00239|pub.1020565681|44;[Billon, Margarita; Lera-Lopez, Fernando; Marco, Rocío]|[ur.010704516551.55; ur.07467301435.29; ur.011223762613.70]|Review of World Economics|2010|146|1|39-73|10.1007/s10290-009-0045-y|pub.1020913051|59;[Ferro, Enrico; Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Gil-Garcia, J.

pub.1047222913,10.4018/978-1-59904-939-7.ch254,Information Access in Rural Communities,"The concept of ‘digital divide’ draws attention to the social context of technology usage. Current IT solutions are technology driven and are focussed on elite consumers in cities. In contrast, regional Australian communities face a number of problems such as remoteness, small population and distance. Knowledge and resource constraints also impact on these communities and businesses. Any attempt to transform regions using new information and communications technologies should take into consideration these unique factors. This chapter focuses on information access in two rural communities in Western Australia. A qualitative study followed by a quantitative phase in two regional towns explored how people access information and where information gaps lie. Results of this research suggest that, along with technical infrastructure, equal emphasis should be placed on the human/community element. Without this, regional transformation will remain mere rhetoric.",Global Information Technologies,2008,,,3585-3591,"Tan, Felix B.; Venkatesan, V.S.; Eversole, Robyn; Robinson, Kem",University of Western Australia; Edith Cowan University,Australia; Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047222913,0,

This paper questions the prevailing emphasis on the “cyber” characteristics of access, e.g. computing and interne access as is currently known, and attempts to refocus the conversation by considering computing and access in the context of the “café”, e.g. as public life in the sense of Habermas. This analysis is based on extant literature and direct ethnographic research in several public places in six countries.

Despite the big progress made by the Central European countries since transition began, most of these countries lag behind the EU-15 average on most Information Society indicators. The variety within Central Europe is enormous, with Slovenia and Estonia close to main-stream Europe and, on the other hand, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary lagging far behind. In most surveyed countries fixed telephone line penetration is stagnating or declining on a rather low level, putting a break on IS development.

As a major target group, teenagers are addressed. While the first stage was to provide access to technology, empirical research has shown that support is necessary to develop the necessary digital literacy. But as we will show, only full integration into the life world of teenagers will really support their learning process. Using examples from our fieldwork in a regional learning environment, we focus on schools and youth centres as being very important locations for the personal development teenagers. Through a careful analysis of strengths and weaknesses especially of the so-called Web.Punkte projects, we will suggest further activities to reach the next stage of life world integration.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2005,3081,,380-390,"Welling, Stefan; Breiter, Andreas",Institute for Information Management Bremen,Germany,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015793514,0,"[Ferchhoff, Wilfried]|[]||1999||||10.1007/978-3-322-95187-8|pub.1005373074|57;[Bohnsack, Ralf; Loos, Peter; Schäffer, Burkhard; Städtler, Klaus; Wild, Bodo]|[ur.012717715115.78; ur.07574244007.98; ur.013357526407.10; ; ur.014341226601.25]||1995||||10.1007/978-3-663-09767-9|pub.1009176757|197;[Nohl, Arnd-Michael]|[ur.014333470031.11]|Forschung Erziehungswissenschaft|2001||||10.1007/978-3-322-97509-6|pub.1032564476|55;[Breiter, Andreas]|[ur.012240263364.39]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2003|116||207-214|10.1007/978-0-387-35663-1_21|pub.1041483806|3;[Breiter, Andreas]|[ur.012240263364.39]|Education and Information Technologies|2003|8|2|109-125|10.1023/a:1024550229787|pub.1046941161|5;[Baumert, Jürgen; Schümer, Gundel]|[ur.016122472731.52; ur.013376336111.48]|PISA 2000|2001|||323-407|10.1007/978-3-322-83412-6_10|pub.1050671242|354;[Coleman, James S.]|[]|American Journal of Sociology|1988|94||s95-s120|10.1086/228943|pub.1058548441|17531;[Servon, Lisa J.]|[]|Bridging the Digital Divide|2002||||10.1002/9780470773529|pub.1109492537|180"

We classify the issue into two problems: access to high-speed Internet, and service utilization of high-speed Internet access. We focus on the latter problem by quantitatively and qualitatively investigating whether a digital divide problem exists based on Internet service utilization. Consequently, we discover that willingness to pay (WTP) for public services over FTTH is almost identical between provincial and urban areas. Furthermore, territorial digital broadcasting over FTTH accounts for a large part of WTP in provincial areas, while tele-working and tele-education are also important as public services over FTTH in urban areas.",The Information Society,2008,24,1,1-17,"Ida, Takanori; Horiguchi, Yuki",Kyoto University; Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications,Japan; Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009219662,15,"[Wong, Poh-Kam]|[ur.015333364767.86]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|167-187|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00065-8|pub.1002363516|85;[Vehovar, Vasja; Sicherl, Pavle; Hüsing, Tobias; Dolnicar, Vesna]|[ur.010323146000.99; ur.014743726325.64; ; ur.015216142421.66]|The Information Society|2006|22|5|279-290|10.1080/01972240600904076|pub.1002642735|135;[Strover, Sharon]|[ur.012341524001.11]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|275-277|10.1080/01972240309481|pub.1004177104|40;[Ida, Takanori; Kuroda, Toshifumi]|[ur.010140432415.22; ur.015671560367.69]|Journal of Regulatory Economics|2006|29|1|5-22|10.1007/s11149-005-5124-y|pub.1008698690|58;[Madden, Gary; Savage, Scott J.; Coble-Neal, Grant]|[ur.011425771741.73; ur.07665401243.52; ur.014775325515.94]|Information Economics and Policy|1999|11|2|195-207|10.1016/s0167-6245(99)00015-3|pub.1013529770|49;[Firth, Lucy; Mellor, David]|[ur.01224207350.84; ur.01160275321.59]|Telecommunications Policy|2005|29|2-3|223-236|10.1016/j.telpol.2004.11.004|pub.1014700335|61;[Mariscal, Judith]|[ur.07365701451.47]|Telecommunications Policy|2005|29|5-6|409-428|10.1016/j.telpol.2005.03.004|pub.1015198978|80;[Savage, Scott J.; Waldman, Donald]|[ur.07665401243.52; ur.013503010221.14]|Telecommunications Policy|2005|29|8|615-633|10.1016/j.telpol.2005.06.001|pub.1016875312|85;[Fildes, Robert; Kumar, V.]|[ur.07376215165.19; ]|International Journal of Forecasting|2002|18|4|489-522|10.1016/s0169-2070(02)00064-x|pub.1018132448|79;[Brownstone, David; Train, Kenneth]|[ur.015301737103.56; ur.012363074225.02]|Journal of Econometrics|1998|89|1-2|109-129|10.1016/s0304-4076(98)00057-8|pub.1020018000|529;[Dawes, Robyn M.; Corrigan, Bernard]|[ur.016702625430.90; ]|Psychological Bulletin|1974|81|2|95-106|10.1037/h0037613|pub.1022236592|1431;[Duffy-Deno, Kevin T.]|[ur.016270214623.23]|Journal of Regulatory Economics|2003|24|3|359-372|10.1023/a:1025659007897|pub.1022887290|20;[Wilhelm, Anthony G.]|[]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|279-286|10.1080/01972240309482|pub.1025361280|10;[Revelt, David; Train, Kenneth]|[ur.012730735226.16; ]|The Review of Economics and Statistics|1998|80|4|647-657|10.1162/003465398557735|pub.1032187624|1295;[Madden, Gary; Simpson, Michael]|[; ]|Applied Economics|1997|29|8|1073-1078|10.1080/000368497326462|pub.1035234087|48;[Halton, J.

The big, well-funded libraries can offer a wonderful array of digital products to their users. The smaller libraries can afford to offer little. Costs for digital products continue to rise. This becomes apparent when medical students rotate from one hospital to another and complain about the lack of resources available in a library. It does not have to be so. There are many digital services that a small hospital library can offer. In the digital age, it is not how much space that defines a library but rather how much freely available content can be accessed.

It shows that, despite their shared concerns with illustrating social inequality through the lens of information resource distribution, the two areas in effect represent two overlapping research communities. The research focus and discourse of the former were primarily shaped by three different theoretical perspectives and were inspired by a fairly strong sense of ethical principles; those of the latter, on the other hand, were shaped primarily by four different political standpoints and were imbued with a fairly strong concern for political and economical interests. The co-existence of multifarious perspectives and standpoints has produced divergent, and sometimes contradictory, research findings and policy recommendations, which inevitably perplex researchers and policy makers.

This is true of comparative studies on information and communication technologies (ICTs) and e-government. As a result, there is less research on the South-South digital divide and/or cross-national comparative studies that focus mainly on developing countries. This paper addresses this gap by comparing contents of African and Asian e-government service websites. Based on analyses of 582 African and 939 Asian e-government service websites, we present comparisons of the contents of websites from the two continents with respect to the type of site, type of service, features, online executable services, level/stage of development of e-government service, and e-government index. Overall, e-government service websites from the two continents have similar contents, save a few differences.",2010 43rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,2010,,,1-9,"Rorissa, Abebe; Gharawi, Mohammed; Demissie, Dawit","University at Albany, State University of New York",United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095701016,3,"[Garson, G.

pub.1068626714,10.18356/d51f530b-en,The role of e-governance in bridging the digital divide,"Ever since I attended the May 2011 World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) Forum, I keep thinking about one of the trends in e-government that was debated there: namely, that the development of e-services is directly linked to the active involvement of citizens and the private sector in the delivery of public services. Consequently, there is a need to increase the level and depth of all stakeholders’ participation in decision making and in the process of implementing e-governance. This, together with international, national, and individual cooperation, could help address the issue of achieving an all-inclusive Information Society. On the other hand, the heterogeneity of e-government models and the great gap between knowledge-based and rudimentary societies are the biggest impediments to overcome. In this context, we need to discern what influence and role e-governance plays in bridging the digital divide.",UN Chronicle,2011,48,3,37-39,"Stoiciu, Andreea",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1068626714,11,

He had just returned from a long trip around the world, meeting with potential business partners, and now, back in Cambridge, MA, he was reflecting on how it all started. He had founded bracNet 4 years ago with the mission of bringing broadband wireless internet access to his native Bangladesh. bracNet had made much progress since, but much more remained to be done. It still sounded very bold that a country which barely provided running water to all its citizens should soon possess comprehensive access to high-speed wireless internet. As he glanced over Cambridge, MA, he was reminded that this feat had not even been achieved here in the hub of technological development (near MIT and Harvard).",Humanism in Business Series,2011,,,62-75,"Pirson, Michael",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026913924,1,

Controlling for socioeconomic variables, the effects of rural residence and gender disappeared but African Americans were still less likely to have home computers or Internet access. When public Internet access was examined, rural residence and gender had no effect but African Americans were more likely to know of public facilities in their community even when socioeconomic variables were controlled. Future research needs to better understand the implications of different ways of using new technology (i. e., public vs. private access) and determine if digital technology deepens socioeconomic chasms or provides new opportunities.",Social Science Computer Review,2003,21,2,133-143,"Wilson, Kenneth R.; Wallin, Jennifer S.; Reiser, Christa",East Carolina University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015934109,133,"[Bertot, John Carlo; McClure, Charles R]|[ur.011253735727.32; ur.011622741644.06]|Library & Information Science Research|1999|21|3|281-298|10.1016/s0740-8188(99)00014-6|pub.1006794270|9;[Hindman, Douglas Blanks]|[ur.012531241453.88]|Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly|2000|77|3|549-560|10.1177/107769900007700306|pub.1016275694|99;[Fletcher-Flinn, Claire M.; Suddendorf, Thomas]|[ur.01225327360.80; ur.01260634642.23]|Journal of Educational Computing Research|1996|15|4|369-392|10.2190/lk8m-twu3-mwgf-9t1t|pub.1022362485|24;[Lauman, Daylene J.]|[ur.015713745013.18]|Journal of Research on Computing in Education|2000|33|2|196-203|10.1080/08886504.2000.10782309|pub.1022558649|16;[Reinen, Ingeborg Janssen; Plomp, Tjeerd]|[ur.010153342115.62; ur.015713405036.53]|Computers & Education|1997|28|2|65-78|10.1016/s0360-1315(97)00005-5|pub.1026194667|91;[Drabenstott, Mark]|[ur.011671667761.42]|International Regional Science Review|2001|24|1|3-15|10.1177/016001701761012962|pub.1037920893|33;[DiMaggio, Paul; Hargittai, Eszter; Neuman, W.

The extent and the nature of this divide depend on the kind of access defined. Considering the possession of hardware, growing divides among different categories of income, employment, education, age, and ethnicity can be proved to have existed in the 1980s and 1990s according to official American and Dutch statistics. If only by effects of saturation, these gaps will more or less close. However, it is shown that differential access of skills and usage is likely to increase. The growth of a usage gap is projected. Multivariate analyses of Dutch official statistics reveal the striking effect of age and gender as compared to education. The usage gap is related to the evolution of the information and network society.

This critical analysis argues that the Digital Divide involves issues concerning how democracy and democratization are related to computer-mediated communication (CMC) and its role in political communication. As the roles of CMC/ICT systems expand in political communication, existing Digital Divide gaps are likely to contribute to structural inequalities in political participation. These inequalities work against democracy and political empowerment for some people, while at the same time producing expanded opportunities of political participation for others.

Underestimated for quite some time, spam is now recognized as a problem costing the community billions of dollars per annum. One of the direct impacts of the spam flood is the widespread deployment of anti-spam measures, such as email filters and block lists. In this paper, we summarize scholarly and anecdotal evidence suggesting that apart from reducing the spam load, anti-spam measures are also undermining the email system in terms of reliability and usability. Furthermore, we discuss findings suggesting that anti-spam measures are also contributing to establishing a digital divide between those having a choice as to how they access email (both from a technical perspective and an educational point of view) and those who are not in this favorable position.",Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,2005,41,1,176-183,"Lueg, Christopher P.",Charles Darwin University,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010633117,1,"[Cranor, Lorrie Faith; LaMacchia, Brian A.]|[ur.012313770727.30; ur.011613362722.40]|Communications of the ACM|1998|41|8|74-83|10.1145/280324.280336|pub.1052310397|175;[]|[]|Choice|2002|39|10|39-5858-39-5858|10.5860/choice.39-5858|pub.1073379959|320;[Lueg, Christopher]|[]|InSITE Conference|2003||||10.28945/2729|pub.1095920861|6;[Servon, Lisa J.]|[]|Bridging the Digital Divide|2002||||10.1002/9780470773529|pub.1109492537|180"

The prevailing digital divide will continue to exist and define the characteristics of the digital information environment of the sub-region as it influences, along with other concerns, the information needs of end-users in the sub-region.

The model of the information needs of end-users in the electronic information environment presents the nature of user tasks, the state of electronic resources in use, and user experience in using the electronic resources as factors giving rise to information needs of end-users in a digital information environment.

pub.1021302678,10.1108/07378830710820970,Paradigms shifts in information environment: prospects and challenges African libraries,"Purpose The purpose is to trace the revolution in information and communication technology (ICT) and changes in this wake such as globalization, digital divide, information society, Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and e‐government and how these changes impact on the provision of library and information services.   Design/methodology/approach The paper is largely based on review of literature both online and print.   Findings The paper concludes that the paradigm shifts occurring in the information environment have affected the concept of library; the perception of ownership versus access of library resources; the nature of information resources and services; and the role of the information professional among others.   Research limitations/implications The paper advocates for a proactive strategy on the part of information professionals in order to re‐engineer and adapt the library to the volatile global information environment in order to remain relevant in the wake of new paradigm occurrences.   Practical implications Effective access and use of information will inevitably have great influence on the realisation of positive effects that the new paradigms occurrences engender in the global environment. It is desirable at this point in time to research into how information access and use can be brought to bear on the attainment of MDGs, bridge digital divide, enhance attainment of information society, promote e‐government, etc.   Originality/value Despite, the rapid changes within the global information environment that has been occasioned by ICT, there is lack of critical mass of information science literature that addresses issues such MDGs, globalisation, information society and digital divide from the perspective of the information professional.",Library Hi Tech,2007,25,3,396-408,"Mutula, Stephen M.",University of Botswana,Botswana,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021302678,9,"[Wamukoya, Justus; Mutula, Stephen M.]|[ur.011536337053.83; ur.013325104101.71]|Records Management Journal|2005|15|2|71-79|10.1108/09565690510614210|pub.1040442831|48;[Adam, Lishan; Wood, Frances]|[ur.016605630510.53; ur.011142652601.87]|Journal of Information Science|1999|25|4|307-318|10.1177/016555159902500407|pub.1063752236|44;[McClure, Fred]|[ur.015001023447.67]|NIR news|2002|13|5|3-5|10.1255/nirn.677|pub.1064522967|1;[Warschauer, Mark]|[]|First Monday|2002|7|7||10.5210/fm.v7i7.967|pub.1072710766|277;[Neill, Samuel D.]|[]|Journal of Education for Library and Information Science|1971|12|1|20|10.2307/40322151|pub.1102992909|1"

It is important for the young researcher, engineer and nonengineering user to consider the development of global network and inter-regional cooperation toward the issues. This activity will be engine for the advancement of the global Internet. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce several case examples for fostering of next generation peoples who will take a major role in development of the Internet.

The key findings in this study are (a) a notable progress in e-democracy opportunity on the global stage; (b) the fact that in some countries there is a rapid ICT expansion and global success in e-democracy, and yet, there is a growing digital divide between the most and least developed e-democratic nations.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2009,5621,,700-709,"Shirazi, Farid",Ryerson University,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038938134,2,"[Mercer, Claire]|[]|Review of African Political Economy|2004|31|99|49-64|10.1080/0305624042000258414|pub.1002180143|36;[Dahlgren, Peter]|[]|Political Communication|2005|22|2|147-162|10.1080/10584600590933160|pub.1002845676|835;[Ott, Dana; Rosser, Melissa]|[; ]|Democratization|2000|7|1|137-156|10.1080/13510340008403649|pub.1002992578|23;[Barzilai-Nahon, Karine; Barzilai, Gad]|[ur.014613452655.40; ur.015661610203.30]|The Information Society|2005|21|1|25-40|10.1080/01972240590895892|pub.1008630259|137;[Snellen, Ignace]|[ur.012422701177.19]|Communications of the ACM|2001|44|1|45-48|10.1145/357489.357504|pub.1009445925|20;[Becker, Ted]|[]|Communications of the ACM|2001|44|1|39-43|10.1145/357489.357503|pub.1020335321|40;[DOOSTDAR, ALIREZA]|[ur.015470402717.29]|American Anthropologist|2004|106|4|651-662|10.1525/aa.2004.106.4.651|pub.1022540688|62;[Klein, Hans K.]|[]|The Information Society|1999|15|4|213-220|10.1080/019722499128376|pub.1025580979|79;[Suárez, Sandra L.]|[]|Representation|2006|42|2|117-128|10.1080/00344890600736358|pub.1026417350|48;[Osborn, Michelle]|[]|Journal of Eastern African Studies|2008|2|2|315-327|10.1080/17531050802094836|pub.1032611482|42;[Delbridge, Rick]|[ur.013211076075.00]|Organization Studies|2007|28|9|1347-1357|10.1177/0170840607080744|pub.1040384851|30;[Gimmler, Antje]|[ur.016026004504.54]|Philosophy & Social Criticism|2001|27|4|21-39|10.1177/019145370102700402|pub.1049086895|153;[Shirazi, Farid]|[ur.016234346461.05]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2008|282||299-317|10.1007/978-0-387-84822-8_20|pub.1051087040|1;[Main, Linda]|[]|Third World Quarterly|2001|22|1|83-97|10.1080/713701143|pub.1058424240|40;[Stahl, B.C.]|[ur.015337552312.43]|IEEE Technology and Society Magazine|2007|26|1|35-45|10.1109/mtas.2007.335570|pub.1061430747|11;[Chadwick, Andrew]|[ur.015073616613.67]|Social Science Computer Review|2003|21|4|443-455|10.1177/0894439303256372|pub.1063872514|145;[Jankowski, Nicholas; van Selm, Martine]|[ur.012710771476.50; ur.0751255730.41]|Digital Democracy: Issues of Theory and Practice|2000|||149-165|10.4135/9781446218891.n9|pub.1087932634|57;[Shirazi, Farid]|[ur.016234346461.05]|The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries|2008|35|1|1-24|10.1002/j.1681-4835.2008.tb00243.x|pub.1099634469|24;[]|[]|Digital Democracy: Issues of Theory and Practice|2000||||10.4135/9781446218891|pub.1100191652|114;[]|[]|Democracy and New Media|2003||||10.7551/mitpress/2328.003.0004|pub.1110617121|4"

The chapter begins with discussion about the digital divide among ethnic minorities, particularly African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans (Latinos), in the United States. This chapter defines “access” as having a computer interface that facilitates user learning. One proposed human factors intervention for this problem of access is in recognizing and accounting for culture’s influence on cognition. This discussion is grounded in the development and employment of computer interface metaphor designs that are culturally valid for target user groups. We also provide examples of challenges that users may encounter when inappropriate interface metaphor are built into a computer interface design. Finally, the chapter highlights various human factors interventions and considerations that will provide a pathway to achieving greater levels of e-inclusivity and for providing citizens with equitable access to information.",Handbook of Research on Overcoming Digital Divides,2010,,,606-629,"Ferro, Enrico; Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Gil-Garcia, J.

pub.1002245632,10.4018/jicthd.2009010103,"Digital Divide, Social Divide, Paradigmatic Divide","The digital divide is nothing else than the reflection of the social divide in the digital world. The use of ICT for human development does offer opportunities to reduce the social divide for individual beings or communities; yet there exists a series of obstacles to overcome. The very existence of an infrastructure for connectivity is only the first obstacle, although it often receives an exclusive focus, due to the lack of an holistic approach which gives an essential part to digital and information literacy. Telecommunications, hardware and software are predictable prerequisites; however, the true pillars of human-focused information societies are education, ethics, and participation, interacting together as a systemic process. As long as decision makers are not ready to consider these evidences, and keep on favoring a mere technological vision, we will suffer from the most dangerous divide in terms of impact: the paradigmatic divide. Any resemblance to characters, projects, or policies in real life is quite intentional.",International Journal of Information Communication Technologies and Human Development,2009,1,1,33-48,"Pimienta, Daniel",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002245632,3,

Hence, for being competitive it is important that these services are available, employ the latest technology and are low cost. Unfortunately, it often happens that these good intentions do not correspond to reality. In this paper an information system is proposed, targeted at those small realities affected by the digital divide and at those companies that employ out of date, high cost technologies, that provides data and voice services in a unified manner using heterogeneous devices. The system utilizes innovative technologies, in particular wireless technology, to deliver low cost solutions. The distinctive feature is that it does not depend on the network hardware infrastructure and the underlying platform. Furthermore, it deals with the configuration, accounting, security, management, and monitoring aspects while maintaining its flexibility and simplicity of use both for the administrator and end user.",2008 The Fourth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications,2008,,,130-136,"Fenu, Gianni; Piras, Luca",University of Cagliari,Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093564986,1,"[Barka, Ezedin S.; Mohamed, Emad Eldin; Hayawi, Kadhim]|[ur.010627001367.81; ur.012575565405.84; ur.014346425133.13]|Proceeding of the 2006 international conference on Communications and mobile computing  - IWCMC '06|2006|||1295-1300|10.1145/1143549.1143809|pub.1019567436|3;[Takaaki, Komura; Kenji, Fujikawa; Yasuo, Okabe]|[ur.07413026743.88; ur.014251741475.17; ur.010037372243.01]|Proceedings of the 1st ACM international workshop on Wireless mobile applications and services on WLAN hotspots  - WMASH '03|2003|||56-63|10.1145/941326.941335|pub.1036288221|7;[Fang, Yuguang; Chlamtac, I.; Lin, Yi-Bing]|[ur.012537277436.25; ur.016442443521.90; ur.011456413712.95]|IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology|1999|48|2|638-651|10.1109/25.752589|pub.1061135139|6;[Lee, Ju–A; Kim, Jae-Hyun; Park, Jun-Hee; Moon, Kyung-Duk]|[; ur.012136561761.79; ur.011016611711.67; ur.011164107173.53]|2006 IEEE 63rd Vehicular Technology Conference|2006|2||818-822|10.1109/vetecs.2006.1682938|pub.1093217862|4;[Luo, Hui; Henry, Paul]|[; ]|GLOBECOM '03.

pub.1064003224,10.1177/146045820100700202,Health informatics and the cultural divide: a UK perspective,"This paper discusses the concerns about the growing ‘digital divide’ within society which has implications for maintaining both health and social inequalities in the UK. The main focus of the paper is about inequalities in health relating to culture and ethnicity. Different theoretical approaches to cultural differences in health are set out as well as different ways of classifying cultural and ethnic differences in health service research. The argument then goes on to suggest that the emphasis on cultural and ethnic categorization only further divides people and fails to reduce inequalities. Transculturalism is defined and set out as a more useful way of approaching cultural difference as it is less restrictive and prescriptive. The paper sets out how this approach can be used to develop better quality health content in health informatics that is useful and relevant to a wider range of users, thus tackling both the digital divide and health inequalities.a",Health Informatics Journal,2001,7,2,62-65,"McPherson, S.; Wilkinson, M.",London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1064003224,0,"[Anand, S S]|[ur.01241444362.32]|Ethnicity and Health|1999|4|4|241-244|10.1080/13557859998029|pub.1017796313|43;[Case, Leslie; Smith, Timothy B.]|[; ur.01140055755.06]|Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|2000|68|6|1107-1110|10.1037/0022-006x.68.6.1107|pub.1022866646|29;[Aspinall, P J]|[ur.0751731325.00]|Ethnicity and Health|2000|5|1|33-40|10.1080/13557850050007329|pub.1029905840|20;[Landrine, Hope; Klonoff, Elizabeth A.]|[ur.01170017123.76; ur.01244014530.50]|Health Psychology|1992|11|4|267-276|10.1037/0278-6133.11.4.267|pub.1036495982|139;[Wilkinson, Richard]|[]||1996||||10.4324/9780203421680|pub.1038827497|1941;[Hong, Ying-yi; Morris, Michael W.; Chiu, Chi-yue; Benet-Martínez, Verónica]|[ur.01244607475.49; ur.015661141525.29; ur.01007272055.33; ur.0646124557.48]|American Psychologist|2000|55|7|709-720|10.1037/0003-066x.55.7.709|pub.1049835223|1426"
pub.1039066922,10.1016/j.telpol.2009.08.006,Disparities in ICT adoption: A multidimensional approach to study the cross-country digital divide,"This paper presents a cross-country study on the determinants of information and communication technology (ICT) diffusion using multivariate analysis techniques to capture the relative and multidimensional character of digital divide. Using canonical correlation analysis, the differences detected between groups of countries both in terms of ICT patterns and in terms of the factors explaining each are compared. The results provide the ability to distinguish between different patterns of ICT adoption that can be explained primarily by variables associated with differences in development levels. In countries registering higher levels of ICT adoption, the digitalization pattern is explained by GDP, service sector, education, and governmental effectiveness. In contrast, in developing countries, population age and urban population are positively associated with the ICT adoption, while Internet costs impact negatively.

Nonetheless, a fundamental digital divide problem poses the greatest challenge as almost 70% of the population of the countries of Asia Pacific has little or no connectivity to the digital world. Concerted international collaborative efforts are much needed, not only to push ahead with the various aspects of the digital library research agenda and realize the global digital library vision of the future, but to derive novel solutions to eliminate or close the gap of digital divide across various parts of the world.",Design and Usability of Digital Libraries,2005,,,351-370,"Theng, Yin-Leng; Foo, Schubert; Foo, Schubert; Theng, Yin-Leng",Nanyang Technological University,Singapore,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013059150,1,

This kind of gap, known as ‘digital divide’ exists even within a country and even among developed nations. A solution to this problem of bridging the digital divide requires a platform for consuming, sharing, and producing information in an easy-to-use and understandable format, apart from the infra structural requirements. This paper discusses our approach in the form of a framework called Empowering Communities through KnOwledge (ECKO). Our framework includes the processes, and deployment models apart from the software. The framework enables knowledge sharing among the community and fosters the creation of multi-dimensional knowledge repositories. We illustrate our phase-by-phase approach, which is generic enough to be replicated across countries.

In particular, it examines the extent to which inequities in the use of and access to ICT exist among Canadian high school students based on gender, socioeconomic status, and rural-urban location. The analyses suggest that there is a digital divide for Canadian youth in access to and experience with ICT. Rural youth are less likely to have access to computers in the home; however, frequency of use and perceived competency levels are not compromised because they make greater use of computers at school. Female youth and those from families with low levels of parental education are also less likely to have access to computers in their homes; they tend to access computers less frequently and report lower levels of computer skills competency.",Social Science Computer Review,2003,21,4,475-490,"Looker, E.

The constructivist conceptual framework and the grounded nature of the method enabled in-depth exploration of key issues not undertaken before by the mainly positivist studies. The purposeful sample of 32 participants was selected to represent the major categories of people relevant to the research. Everett Rogers’ famous analysis of ‘diffusion of innovations’ was one theoretical framework used to illuminate the findings; the other was digital divide factors in relation to banking choices. The findings include 1) that the major motivation for people to adopt Internet banking is convenience, closely linked to time savings and ease of accessibility, as well as confidence and skill in Internet use; and 2) that, at the time of the study, digital divide factors were playing an important part in banking choices.",Global Information Technologies,2008,,,1973-1984,"Tan, Felix B.; Williamson, Kristy; Lichtenstein, Sharman; Sullivan, Jen; Schauder, Don",Monash University; Charles Sturt University; Deakin University,Australia; Australia; Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050283693,0,

pub.1093892360,10.1109/icee.2010.1056,ODR in E-Government and Obstacles to Developing Countries,"Many developed countries consider e-government to be an essential strategy to modernizing government. Undoubtedly it is imperative that ODR be incorporated into e-government strategies because not only will ODR free up court resources but ODR is generally cheaper, quicker and less adversarial. However, there is a ‘digital divide’ existing between developed and developing counties in utilizing ODR, although some developing counties have already begun to recognize the potential that ODR offer and made some achievement. But the ability to realize the potential gains from e-government and ODR is dependent on a number of variables such as political support, the existence of an adequate legal framework, available funds and infrastructure, technical and security factors and cultural changes. Only when the necessary steps have been taken by governments in developing countries to provide their citizens with access to ODR, we will be a lot closer to overcoming the digital divide.",2010 International Conference on E-Business and E-Government,2010,,,4204-4207,"Han, Baoqing",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093892360,0,

Rural Internet connectivity and the no access/dial-up/high-speed decision,"As residential high-speed Internet access has become more prevalent, the nature of the rural–urban digital divide in access has shifted. In 2000, dial-up access rates in rural households lagged behind their urban counterparts by 11 percentage points. By 2003, however, dial-up access rates were equal in rural and urban areas, but high-speed access rates were 14 percentage points higher in urban areas. This article uses a nested logit model to explore the household decision between no Internet access, dial-up access and high-speed access. A decomposition technique is then used to estimate the contributions of various factors, including education, income and infrastructure levels, to differences in Internet access among rural and urban households. The results suggest that policies which solely promote infrastructure in rural areas fail to address the dominant factors in the emerging high-speed digital divide.",Applied Economics,2008,42,15,1889-1905,"Whitacre, Brian E.; Mills, Bradford F.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045625670,10,"[Nielsen, Helena Skyt]|[ur.01134546175.87]|Economics Letters|1998|61|1|115-120|10.1016/s0165-1765(98)00155-4|pub.1003516742|54;[GRUBESIC, TONY H.; MURRAY, ALAN T.]|[ur.01102232364.97; ur.011335074125.33]|Growth and Change|2004|35|2|139-165|10.1111/j.0017-4815.2004.00243.x|pub.1017279540|92;[Townsend, Anthony M]|[ur.016273564546.23]|Environment and Planning B Urban Analytics and City Science|2001|28|1|39-58|10.1068/b2688|pub.1023403456|111;[Mills, Bradford F.; Whitacre, Brian E.]|[ur.014170025161.80; ur.0576564754.20]|Growth and Change|2003|34|2|219-243|10.1111/1468-2257.00215|pub.1025842918|91;[Malecki, Edward J]|[ur.016304164460.13]|Journal of Rural Studies|2003|19|2|201-214|10.1016/s0743-0167(02)00068-2|pub.1030500943|208;[Drabenstott, Mark]|[ur.011671667761.42]|International Regional Science Review|2001|24|1|3-15|10.1177/016001701761012962|pub.1037920893|33;[Forestier, Emmanuel; Grace, Jeremy; Kenny, Charles]|[; ur.07740001375.80; ur.010254167455.56]|Telecommunications Policy|2002|26|11|623-646|10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00061-7|pub.1050411674|78;[Graham, Stephen; Aurigi, Alessandro]|[ur.013376276305.61; ur.010507065457.43]|Journal of Urban Technology|1997|4|1|19-52|10.1080/10630739708724546|pub.1053387524|118;[Chaney, Carole Kennedy; Alvarez, R.

The authors test their theory with interdependence methods of analysis, which are suitable methodological instrument for relating Internet uses to social structure through the concepts of scale and linkage needs. The authors’ theory suggests that, since Internet uses are socially structured, the first-level digital divide may be reduced but will not disappear, and Internet uses will continue to differ (second-level digital divide). The theory not only explains Spaniards’ Internet use and more recent empirical findings but also proposes answers to critical contemporary social questions regarding the use of digital technologies and the digital inequality debate.",Social Science Computer Review,2010,30,1,108-129,"López-Sintas, Jordi; Filimon, Nela; García-Álvarez, Maria Ercilia",Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Girona; Rovira i Virgili University,Spain; Spain; Spain,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013175236,12,"[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|New Media & Society|2004|6|3|341-362|10.1177/1461444804042519|pub.1003317453|630;[Blasius, Jörg; Friedrichs, Jürgen]|[ur.015273154111.26; ur.01372120265.64]|Poetics|2008|36|1|24-44|10.1016/j.poetic.2007.12.001|pub.1007367975|42;[Goldfarb, Avi; Prince, Jeff]|[ur.0636245456.94; ]|Information Economics and Policy|2008|20|1|2-15|10.1016/j.infoecopol.2007.05.001|pub.1014279471|257;[Aslanidou, Sofia; Menexes, George]|[; ur.0620624735.55]|Computers & Education|2008|51|3|1375-1391|10.1016/j.compedu.2007.12.003|pub.1015328637|55;[Franzen, Axel]|[ur.011451602105.45]|Kyklos|2003|56|3|341-360|10.1046/j.0023-5962.2003.00224.x|pub.1021809595|41;[Zillien, Nicole; Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.0700150321.71; ur.014036273417.00]|Social Science Quarterly|2009|90|2|274-291|10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x|pub.1022503348|384;[Robinson, Laura]|[]|Information Communication & Society|2009|12|4|488-507|10.1080/13691180902857678|pub.1028856709|161;[Wolff, Hans-Georg; Moser, Klaus]|[ur.013555536457.05; ur.015256114643.08]|Journal of Applied Psychology|2009|94|1|196-206|10.1037/a0013350|pub.1031657846|290;[Menger, Pierre-Michel]|[ur.012110505003.23]|Annual Review of Sociology|1999|25|1|541-574|10.1146/annurev.soc.25.1.541|pub.1034994497|397;[Venables, W.

Everett Rogers’ famous analysis of ‘diffusion of innovations’ was one theoretical framework used to illuminate the findings; the other was digital divide factors in relation to banking choices. The findings include 1) that the major motivation for people to adopt Internet banking is convenience, closely linked to time savings and ease of accessibility, as well as confidence and skill in Internet use; and 2) that, at the time of the study, digital divide factors were playing an important part in banking choices.",International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction,2006,2,4,17-36,"Williamson, Kirsty; Lichtenstein, Sharman; Sullivan, Jen; Schauder, Don",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1071885981,3,

The immediate goal of this research was the creation of the Monash Community ICT Index. This paper represents the first attempt to provide a more in-depth analysis of the data obtained in that survey, setting the results in the context of research undertaken by Zook (2001), Castells (2001) and Adamic (2001), who consider that not only is the Internet a natural fit with “winner-take-all” markets but reinforces existing patterns of geographic centralisation in the information society and economy. It will pay particular attention to factors such as the location and size of organisations, and whether there is any support for the notion of a digital divide in the social communications networks and creators of knowledge within the Australian community sector.",Australian Journal of Information Systems,2004,11,2,,"Denison, Tom",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070994995,1,
pub.1044402377,10.1007/0-387-23120-x_22,An indigenous approach to bridging the digital divide,"Knowledge, information and communication are at the core of the emerging global Information Society. Knowledge, information and communication, however, are culturally defined concepts and expressions. Also, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) — the medium for disseminating and communicating knowledge and information - are cultural products of the society that has developed them. Indigenous Peoples have their own concepts of knowledge, information and communication and have developed their own forms of information communication. Therefore Indigenous Peoples need to take part in the Information Society on their own terms and on the basis of their cultural backgrounds, to be able to shape their future without risking to lose their cultures and identities. This project aims to contribute to this process by addressing four major aspects: identification and development of culturally appropriate ICT applications; elaboration of Indigenous approaches and strategies to bridge the digital divide; design of culturally appropriate capacity-building tools; elaboration of culturally appropriate development strategies for utilisation of ICTs for poverty reduction.",IFIP International Federation for Information Processing,2005,161,,237-240,"Deer, Kenneth; Håkansson, Ann-Kristin",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1044402377,3,

It will also lead users to find information they need, all in one place. With that in mind, we have implemented the ‘labeling’/’cataloging’ of online resources and learning objects.

Specifically, this study explores a shift in the perception and ranking of barriers to implementation of information and communication technology (ICT)-based solutions among SMEs, which can be attributed to the degree of ICT readiness exhibited by a given country. We have verified a hypothesis that the more knowledge-based a given economy is (as measured by ICT indexes), the more likely it is that perception of the key ICT implementation barriers among SMEs will shift away from mere lack of funds and technology toward lack of knowledge, education and information system planning. The conclusion of this study may well serve a better distribution of resources allocated by the governments to overcome the business digital divide that limits productivity of so many SMEs.",Journal of Information Science,2010,36,2,162-174,"Wielicki, Tom; Arendt, Lukasz","California State University, Fresno; University of Łódź",United States; Poland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022506540,34,"[Chesher, Mike; Skok, Walter]|[; ur.012321422546.42]|Proceedings of the 2000 ACM SIGCPR conference on Computer personnel research  - SIGCPR '00|2000|||16-22|10.1145/333334.333338|pub.1003219016|11;[Ferlander, Sara; Timms, Duncan]|[ur.0627715457.58; ur.0702464615.15]|Information Communication & Society|2006|9|2|137-159|10.1080/13691180600630732|pub.1005544128|17;[Graham, Stephen]|[]|Urban Studies|2002|39|1|33-56|10.1080/00420980220099050|pub.1010968716|244;[Gómez Barroso, José Luis; Pérez Martínez, Jorge]|[ur.013236352471.21; ur.014217764705.35]|Universal Access in the Information Society|2004|3|3-4|264-271|10.1007/s10209-004-0103-0|pub.1011613866|7;[Desai, Meghnad; Fukuda-Parr, Sakiko; Johansson, Claes; Sagasti, Fransisco]|[; ur.014277724745.37; ; ]|Journal of Human Development and Capabilities|2002|3|1|95-122|10.1080/14649880120105399|pub.1013544013|78;[Holloway, Darren]|[]|Information Communication & Society|2005|8|2|168-193|10.1080/13691180500146276|pub.1014447377|18;[Beynon‐Davies, Paul; Hill, Rebecca]|[ur.011263571011.65; ur.010533475474.62]|Journal of Systems and Information Technology|2007|9|1|46-59|10.1108/13287260710817683|pub.1017910211|11;[Arendt, Lukasz]|[ur.015112653115.40]|Journal of Systems and Information Technology|2008|10|2|93-108|10.1108/13287260810897738|pub.1041044173|80;[Arbore, Alessandro; Ordanini, Andrea]|[ur.016643304537.92; ur.015022300133.21]|International Small Business Journal Researching Entrepreneurship|2006|24|1|83-99|10.1177/0266242606059781|pub.1045648215|35;[Lucchetti, Riccardo; Sterlacchini, Alessandro]|[ur.010304043623.23; ur.010635612343.88]|Small Business Economics|2004|23|2|151-168|10.1023/b:sbej.0000027667.55821.53|pub.1053610764|130;[Daniel, Elizabeth M.; Grimshaw, David J.]|[ur.015535626251.48; ur.011456614523.78]|Journal of Information Technology|2002|17|3|133-147|10.1080/0268396022000018409|pub.1058311997|113;[Chinn, M.

Overall results indicate primary importance of scientific and technical capacity as measured by publications, and secondary significance of foreign direct investment, government prioritization of ICT, public spending on education, and math/science education. For developed nations, technology factors are again most strongly associated with scientific publications, followed by foreign direct investment, % of females in the labor force, and education variables. For developing countries, technology attributes are strongly associated with foreign direct investment, government prioritization of IT, and education variables. The cases of ICT development and growth in Egypt and Estonia are examined and found to be consistent with the regression results for developing nations.

pub.1035007258,10.3390/fi3020144,Mobile Phones Bridging the Digital Divide for Teens in the US?,"In 2009, just 27% of American teens with mobile phones reported using their devices to access the internet. However, teens from lower income families and minority teens were significantly more likely to use their phones to go online. Together, these surprising trends suggest a potential narrowing of the digital divide, offering internet access to those without other means of going online. This is an important move, as, in today's society, internet access is central to active citizenship in general and teen citizenship in particular. Yet the cost of this move toward equal access is absorbed by those who can least afford it: Teenagers from low income households. Using survey and focus group data from a national study of “Teens and Mobile Phone Use” (released by Pew and the University of Michigan in 2010), this article helps identify and explain this and other emergent trends for teen use (as well as non-use) of the internet through mobile phones.",Future Internet,2011,3,2,144-158,"Brown, Katie; Campbell, Scott W.; Ling, Rich",University of Michigan–Ann Arbor; IT University of Copenhagen,United States; Denmark,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035007258,58,"[Hampton, Keith N.; Sessions, Lauren F.; Her, Eun Ja]|[ur.012317624303.24; ur.015526473617.12; ur.011026553637.82]|Information Communication & Society|2010|14|1|130-155|10.1080/1369118x.2010.513417|pub.1005962339|161;[Cairncross, Sandy; Kinnear, Joanne]|[ur.01332547100.91; ur.0701136534.17]|Social Science & Medicine|1992|34|2|183-189|10.1016/0277-9536(92)90095-8|pub.1006326225|40;[Ling, Rich]|[]|Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|2010|15|2|277-292|10.1111/j.1083-6101.2010.01520.x|pub.1012012410|73;[Wareham, Jonathan; Levy, Armando; Shi, Wei]|[ur.015066672603.12; ; ]|Telecommunications Policy|2004|28|5-6|439-457|10.1016/j.telpol.2003.11.005|pub.1021926874|75;[Rice, Ronald E; Katz, James E]|[ur.014077537323.51; ur.016135056233.08]|Telecommunications Policy|2003|27|8-9|597-623|10.1016/s0308-5961(03)00068-5|pub.1036982710|364;[Barrantes, Roxana; Galperin, Hernan]|[ur.013054576445.61; ur.010322365021.09]|Telecommunications Policy|2008|32|8|521-530|10.1016/j.telpol.2008.06.002|pub.1043186525|33;[Hilbert, Martin]|[ur.07604622371.11]|World Development|2010|38|5|756-770|10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.019|pub.1044092084|66;[Chai, Andreas; Moneta, Alessio]|[ur.012272061702.44; ur.015052640521.84]|Journal of Economic Perspectives|2010|24|1|225-240|10.1257/jep.24.1.225|pub.1064530473|90;[Putnam, Robert D.]|[]|Political Science and Politics|1995|28|4|664-683|10.2307/420517|pub.1070582595|1585"
pub.1014466938,10.1007/3-540-45491-8_121,Networking for Accessibility: Elderly People and New Technology,"The paper investigates two specific types of practices that are evolving in order to reduce the digital divide and to bring the ICT to the elderly people. They are sensitising and social learning. Sensitising is understood here as a process through which elderly are becoming aware of the new technology, its existence and its possibilities. Sensitising may take place indirectly through everyday social interaction with family and friends as well as directly through specific, organised events, which aim to inform elderly of the ICT. Social learning refers to the organised efforts that gather elderly together to learn about the technology. This is done in local SeniorNet clubs, which connect to the long tradition of study circles in Sweden. Clubs provide both a place where the technology is available to the elderly and a community for learning about the technology.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2002,2398,,628-634,"Männikkö-Barbutiu, Sirkku",Stockholm University,Sweden,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014466938,2,"[Sadagopan, S.]|[ur.014377154251.15]|Ubiquity|2002|2002|January||10.1145/504689.504690|pub.1063170843|609"

A survey based on qualitative and quantitative data collection has been performed to analyze the level of ICTs and e-Business adoption of the Tunisian SMEs. The results shows that to increase the SMEs competitiveness is necessary to invest in all the components of Intellectual capital: human capital (knowledge, skills, and the abilities of people for using the ICTs), structural capital (supportive infrastructure such as buildings, software, processes, patents, and trademarks, proprietary databases) and social capital (relations and collaboration inside and outside the company). At this purpose, the LINCET “Laboratoire d’Innovation Numerique pour la Competitivité de l’Entreprise Tunisienne” project is finally proposed as a coherent proposition to foster the growth of all the components of the Intellectual Capital for the benefits of competitiveness of Tunisian SMEs.",Communications in Computer and Information Science,2010,111,,180-189,"Del Vecchio, Pasquale; Elia, Gianluca; Secundo, Giustina",University of Salento,Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009614655,0,"[Clark, Theodore H.; Croson, David C.; Schiano, William T.]|[ur.015335146155.04; ur.07576461735.44; ur.014176503556.84]|Information Technology and Management|2001|2|3|261-288|10.1023/a:1011497025090|pub.1005818039|20;[Bontis, Nick]|[ur.012625355153.01]|Management Decision|1998|36|2|63-76|10.1108/00251749810204142|pub.1009218549|1462;[Pulic, Ante]|[ur.012153003464.02]|Intellectual Capital for Communities|2005|||197-211|10.1016/b978-0-7506-7773-8.50015-7|pub.1021882364|25;[Mentzas, Gregoris; Apostolou, Dimitris; Kafentzis, Kostas; Georgolios, Panos]|[ur.012475763377.28; ur.015133475416.65; ur.010636376673.19; ur.012263521443.29]|Information Technology and Management|2006|7|4|259-276|10.1007/s10799-006-0276-8|pub.1022084937|34;[Cardoso, Jorge; Bostrom, Robert P.; Sheth, Amit]|[ur.015271112214.88; ; ur.016634763221.51]|Information Technology and Management|2004|5|3-4|319-338|10.1023/b:item.0000031584.14039.99|pub.1023369382|38;[Molla, Alemayehu; Licker, Paul S.]|[ur.011160037430.51; ur.015064625725.30]|Information & Management|2005|42|6|877-899|10.1016/j.im.2004.09.002|pub.1036392064|254;[Lal, K.]|[ur.014105212363.07]|Telematics and Informatics|2005|22|3|181-199|10.1016/j.tele.2004.07.001|pub.1036439652|34;[Bounfour, Ahmed]|[ur.014431702323.57]|Journal of Intellectual Capital|2003|4|3|396-413|10.1108/14691930310487833|pub.1040423917|80;[Bernerth, Jeremy]|[ur.013504303223.38]|Human Resource Development Review|2004|3|1|36-52|10.1177/1534484303261230|pub.1043470690|92;[Daniel, Elizabeth M; Wilson, Hugh N]|[ur.015535626251.48; ur.07645326077.16]|European Journal of Information Systems|2003|12|4|282-296|10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000478|pub.1043902564|136;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]||2001||||10.1017/cbo9781139164887|pub.1098663486|2054;[]|[]|Knowledge Management|2000||||10.7551/mitpress/4075.003.0011|pub.1110620446|11"
pub.1001821159,10.4018/jgim.2010091102,Bridging the Digital Divide: Use of Public Internet Kiosks in Mauritius,"Subsidized ICT access is often provided in less-developed regions of the world to bridge the digital divide. While such efforts can be helpful, their effectiveness depends on targeted users’ willingness to utilize the ICT provided. To better understand the phenomenon from users’ perspective, this study examines the factors influencing individual’s intention and behavior of using public internet kiosks in Mauritius. Having witnessed rapid growth in ICT recently, Mauritius is an appropriate context for this study. Findings indicate that self efficacy, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control are significant in explaining ICT use. Although these factors have been studied in the developed world, their perception and assessment in the developing world differ and deserve more attention. This study adds to the limited empirical research in this part of the world. Implications for research and suggestions for encouraging ICT use in such regions are discussed.",Journal of Global Information Management,2010,18,1,15-38,"Pee, L.G.; Kankanhalli, A.; On Show, V.C.Y.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001821159,5,"[Goodman, S.

pub.1053256113,10.1016/j.iilr.2003.10.011,The information needs of end-users of Sub-Saharan Africa in the digital information environment,"The digital divide is severe in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The prevailing digital divide will continue to exist and define the characteristics of the digital information environment of the sub-region as it influences, along with other concerns, the information needs of end-users in the sub-region. The model of information needs of end-users in the electronic information environment and observations and theories from the literature of Library and Information Science (LIS) show that the information needs of end-users in SSA are for information content that is relevant for day-to-day tasks and that is adequately accessible and effectively usable within the capabilities of the information and communications technology (ICTs) that they possess and their level of skill in manipulating the ICTs. The model of the information needs of end-users in the electronic information environment presents the nature of user tasks, the state of electronic resources in use, and user experience in using the electronic resources as factors giving rise to information needs of end-users in a digital information environment. The principles of least effort, satisficing, utility and accessibility particularly give support to the argument of the paper: that end-users need information content that is adequately accessible and effectively usable within the capabilities of ICTs currently in use by the end-users concerned.

pub.1025154293,10.1108/14684520610659166,E‐business and small Ghanaian exporters,"Purpose The digital divide is supposed to place disadvantaged economies like Ghana in a position where using information and communication technology for development might not be an immediate reality. The purpose of this current study is to argue that the adoption of e‐business practices has benefit for small Ghanaian exporters' organizational improvement, and begin a first‐level investigation in that regard.   Design/methodology/approach This study was exploratory and focused on a sample of active, non‐traditional exporters in Accra. This sample represented the best typology of small export firms in Ghana that had been regular exporters from 2000‐2004. In all, 60 firms responded to questionnaires on e‐business and exporting. Analysis of the data was mainly by means of descriptive statistics.   Findings One‐way ANOVA analysis revealed that the export firm internationalization (measured by export intensity) has no bearing on the level of e‐business involvement or perceptions of the strategic value of e‐business. However, export firms who were more involved in e‐business had a higher perception of the usefulness of e‐business to their export operation. One‐way ANOVA analysis also revealed that for the export firms involved in some e‐business activity, the more internationalized they were, the more importance they attached to e‐business as providing some sort of organizational improvement leverage.   Practical implications Given the exploratory nature of this study, more research is needed to study internal and external barriers to e‐business adoption by these firms, as well as the relationship between e‐business adoption and performance.

pub.1036175711,10.1016/j.techfore.2010.11.008,Sharing mobile phones in developing countries: Implications for the digital divide,"Current estimates of the digital divide in mobile phones between rich and poor countries are based on the ethnocentric assumption that in both regions the use of these products takes place through individual ownership. But while this assumption may be largely true in the former countries, it does not match the circumstances in the latter regions where a considerable amount of sharing is shown to take place (partly for cultural reasons). Using the available survey evidence and a simple arithmetic framework, I show that when sharing is taken into account, the divide entirely ceases to exist or is greatly reduced (though there are one or two exceptions to this general pattern). Improvements in data collection practice will tend, as I see it, to strengthen rather than cast doubt upon this novel finding. If so, questions arise as to the need for a gap analysis per se.As defined by most international organizations, the digital divide in mobile phones is the ratio of subscribers in developed countries to subscribers in developing countries (I use the terms owners and subscribers synonymously11This synonymity assumption is just a simplification. It need not always be true.). This definition however assumes that the only way in which benefits accrue to individuals is by individual ownership of mobile phones.22A similar problem arises with the use of the Internet in developing countries. It is assumed that those who derive benefits from the technology have to actually use it. In reality however there are numerous ways in which poor communities gain benefits without use. I am thinking for example of broadcasting information from the Internet to those who own radios or via intermediaries with loudspeakers. And while this may make sense in developed countries where ownership is indeed widespread, it does not make much sense in poor countries where benefits from use are more heavily derived by sharing of the technology. The problem here is created by the illegitimate transposition of an assumption from one set of circumstances to a highly different environment, a phenomenon described, among others, by Myrdal [5]. My purpose below is to examine the implications of this assumption for the digital divide in mobile phones between rich and poor countries. In particular, I will argue that current measures of this divide are quite heavily overstated, in some cases to the point where the divide disappears altogether. For this purpose I will rely mainly on household survey data that pertains to the middle of the past decade. The first part of the paper deals with the context of the digital divide and a description of the major socio-economic effects of mobile phones.

It was designed to increase accessibility to e-government services by reducing the digital divide in rural areas and to improve the income level of local residents by boosting regional economy through e-commerce. As of 2007, more than 300 villages are working on- and off-line. Information centers, networked to high-speed Internet, were built in each village. Personal computers were distributed to most households and a website of each village was created to facilitate e-commerce activities. Government reports and evaluation research highlight the performance of the six-year-old project. This chapter revisits, not the performance, but the governance structure, the implementation process, managerial capability, and the administrative value of the project for the purpose of further strengthening its enabler-role in reducing the digital divide and expediting regional development.

Hence, developing countries are rushing to implement various ICT interventions in urban-rural areas aiming to engender local or national development. Through an interpretive case study of an ICT intervention in the Chandanbari village area of Bangladesh, this research describes some challenges surrounding ICT interventions. From background literature concerning bridging the digital-divide we emphasise users’ capability, local context and local content during the planning and implementation of ICT interventions. We apply Heeks’ (eDevelopment Briefing, 3(1), 1–2, 2005) information chain model to improve understanding of ICT-led development at the community/individual level. Our findings uncover considerable interest in ICT interventions from the community/individuals; however, there are challenges to the long-term acceptance of ICT interventions, such as the socio-cultural issues of gender discrimination and cultural barriers.",Information Systems Frontiers,2008,11,2,155-166,"Ashraf, Mahfuz; Hanisch, Jo; Swatman, Paul",University of South Australia,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1020692662,20,"[Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Williams, Michael D.; Venkatesh, Viswanath]|[ur.013351366321.15; ur.011356650655.30; ur.01361072103.18]|Information Systems Frontiers|2008|10|4|385|10.1007/s10796-008-9101-8|pub.1001110480|27;[Huerta, Esperanza; Sandoval‐Almazán, Rodrigo]|[ur.013302755157.37; ur.014470034312.52]|Information Technology for Development|2007|13|3|217-232|10.1002/itdj.20071|pub.1004291194|32;[Baliamoune‐Lutz, Mina]|[ur.07704711743.28]|Information Technology for Development|2003|10|3|151-169|10.1002/itdj.1590100303|pub.1004608331|204;[Madon, Shirin]|[ur.011405200023.39]|Information Technology and People|2000|13|2|85-101|10.1108/09593840010339835|pub.1016704711|143;[James, Jeffrey]|[ur.07532230071.92]|Journal of Information Technology|2007|22|3|284-295|10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000097|pub.1023752621|46;[Zhang, Xiaojun; Maruping, Likoebe M.]|[ur.011172524361.55; ur.014073475315.69]|Information Systems Frontiers|2008|10|4|403-413|10.1007/s10796-008-9099-y|pub.1025294866|50;[Avgerou, Chrisanthi]|[ur.012304503075.13]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2003|||373-386|10.1007/978-0-387-35695-2_23|pub.1027990978|114;[Brown, Susan A.]|[ur.013335014664.34]|Information Systems Frontiers|2008|10|4|397|10.1007/s10796-008-9098-z|pub.1031530429|35;[Roman, Raul; Colle, D.]|[; ]|Information Technology for Development|2003|10|2|85-94|10.1002/itdj.1590100204|pub.1037075090|38;[Martin, William J.; McKeown, Sean F.]|[; ]|The Information Society|1993|9|2|145-156|10.1080/01972243.1993.9960137|pub.1043507123|10;[Ramírez, Ricardo; Richardson, Don]|[; ]|Telecommunications Policy|2005|29|4|297-319|10.1016/j.telpol.2004.05.015|pub.1049230068|24;[Avgerou, Chrisanthi]|[ur.012304503075.13]|Information Technology for Development|1998|8|1|15-28|10.1080/02681102.1998.9525288|pub.1050482093|93;[MADON, SHIRIN]|[ur.011405200023.39]|The Information Society|1997|13|3|227-244|10.1080/019722497129115|pub.1050618474|50;[Johnston, Kim D.; Yetton, Philip W.]|[ur.015422012657.87; ur.07415656225.24]|The Journal of Strategic Information Systems|1996|5|3|189-211|10.1016/s0963-8687(96)80003-5|pub.1051860858|68;[Jacobs, S.J.]|[]|Engineering Management Journal|2003|13|1|30-33|10.1049/em:20030105|pub.1056799986|6;[Adam, Lishan; Wood, Frances]|[ur.016605630510.53; ur.011142652601.87]|Journal of Information Science|1999|25|4|307-318|10.1177/016555159902500407|pub.1063752236|44;[Walsham, Geoff]|[]|Information Systems Research|1995|6|4|376-394|10.1287/isre.6.4.376|pub.1064711992|451;[Tipton, Frank B.]|[]|Asean Economic Bulletin|2002|19|1|83-99|10.1355/ae19-1f|pub.1065053393|25;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]||2001||||10.1017/cbo9781139164887|pub.1098663486|2054;[Young, Judy; Ridley, Gail; Ridley, Jeff]|[ur.015547762473.21; ur.014762164277.58; ]|The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries|2001|4|1|1-17|10.1002/j.1681-4835.2001.tb00024.x|pub.1099622026|10;[Kaplan, Bonnie; Duchon, Dennis]|[; ]|MIS Quarterly|1988|12|4|571|10.2307/249133|pub.1102514831|422;[Hsieh; Rai; Keil]|[ur.010045153532.54; ur.011440114532.37; ]|MIS Quarterly|2008|32|1|97|10.2307/25148830|pub.1102515559|355;[Compaine, Benjamin M.]|[]|The Digital Divide|2001||||10.7551/mitpress/2419.001.0001|pub.1110922707|242;[Kumar, Rajendra; Best, Michael L]|[; ]|The Journal of Community Informatics|2007|2|3||10.15353/joci.v2i3.2071|pub.1133391967|51;[Amariles, Fabiola; Paz, Olga P.; Russell, Nathan; Johnson, Nancy]|[; ; ; ]|The Journal of Community Informatics|2007|2|3||10.15353/joci.v2i3.2067|pub.1133391974|22"

One hundred and twenty questionnaires and interviews were completed with participants aged over 55 in Derbyshire and 353 questionnaires and interviews with over 50s in Scotland. Rates of use, computer and Internet activities, and reasons for use and non-use were investigated. These were backed up by four semi-structured interviews with IT trainers, describing experiences and issues of training this age group. The results indicate a “grey” digital divide, with many older people missing out on the benefits that computers and the Internet can provide. They also indicate some of the reasons why older people do not use computers and the Internet more. These suggest some practical ways forward, highlighting the importance of changing older people’s misconceptions about computers, better informing them about what they are, what they can do and how they can be of real practical use.",Universal Access in the Information Society,2006,6,1,43-57,"Morris, Anne; Goodman, Joy; Brading, Helena",Loughborough University; University of Cambridge,United Kingdom; United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014087324,128,"[LOGES, WILLIAM E.; JUNG, JOO-YOUNG]|[ur.01001671405.59; ]|Communication Research|2001|28|4|536-562|10.1177/009365001028004007|pub.1000388613|234;[Laurich, Rob]|[]|Collection Building|2002|21|4|174-182|10.1108/01604950210447421|pub.1012456234|6;[Hawthorn, D]|[]|Interacting with Computers|2000|12|5|507-528|10.1016/s0953-5438(99)00021-1|pub.1024264753|300;[Cody, Michael J.; Dunn, Deborah; Hoppin, Shari; Wendt, Pamela]|[; ; ur.010635225665.22; ]|Communication Education|1999|48|4|269-286|10.1080/03634529909379178|pub.1025384053|176;[Namazi, Kevan H.; McClintic, Mary]|[ur.01337033033.64; ]|Educational Gerontology|2003|29|6|535-550|10.1080/713844391|pub.1032907069|51;[W, Laural Opalinski]|[]|Journal of Technology in Human Services|2001|18|3-4|203-221|10.1300/j017v18n03_13|pub.1035082067|50;[Blit-Cohen, Edith; Litwin, Howard]|[ur.07372455015.16; ur.0654110156.95]|Journal of Aging Studies|2004|18|4|385-398|10.1016/j.jaging.2004.06.007|pub.1036708666|80;[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|Journal of Aging Studies|2004|18|4|369-384|10.1016/j.jaging.2004.06.008|pub.1045693796|312;[Eastman, Jacqueline K.; Iyer, Rajesh]|[ur.011534212311.07; ur.011000003527.90]|Journal of Consumer Marketing|2004|21|3|208-220|10.1108/07363760410534759|pub.1046914301|115;[Mates, Barbara]|[]|Library Hi Tech News|2002|19|9||10.1108/lhtn.2002.23919iaf.004|pub.1061059498|1;[Selwyn, Neil; Gorard, Stephen; Furlong, John]|[ur.010274414500.72; ur.013540425157.90; ur.015440007171.58]|European Journal of Communication|2005|20|1|5-26|10.1177/0267323105049631|pub.1063796540|100;[Morrell, Roger W.; Mayhorn, Christopher B.; Bennett, Joan]|[ur.01011362020.48; ur.01024437566.48; ur.01261560501.85]|Human Factors The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society|2000|42|2|175-182|10.1518/001872000779656444|pub.1067596408|150;[Docampo Rama, M.; Ridder, H.

The four networks are compared across various network architecture dimensions. Our analysis indicates that LINCOS offers reduced capital cost, flexible architectures, and at the same time access to worldwide information systems, and hence has the highest potential to reach effectively the most excluded population in developing countries. Collaborations among technology marketers, national governments and international agencies are needed to identify the needs of the digitally excluded population and select appropriate architectures to serve the needs.",Architectural Issues of Web-Enabled Electronic Business,2003,,,23-39,"Murthy, V.K.; Shi, Nansi; Dholakia, Nikhilesh; Kshetri, Nir K.",University of Rhode Island,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1029259419,5,

It develops a framework that defines four types of information technologies and Internets based on four dimensions of information: physical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic. Technologies like e-mail that only make use of the first three hardly interact with the industrial infrastructure and superstructure. Nonetheless, technologies like e-commerce that require the pragmatic dimension, which is related to matter and energy (products and services) need such structures. For example, e-commerce requires a trustworthy transportation and payment infrastructure. Unfortunately, developing countries are lacking them. This differential capacity to use the pragmatic dimension of AdvIT/IS (pragmatic fragility) explains why developing countries are not able to skip industrialization and jump into the information era. This pragmatic fragility increases the existing digital divide since implementing e-business in developing countries ends up being the digitalization of bad business practices.",Electronic Business in Developing Countries,2005,,,1-35,"Kamel, Sherif; Ferran, Carlos; Salim, Ricardo",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019200873,3,

This paper argues that examining tutoring techniques in a community computer training centre is useful to discovering why they will persist with learning. Using a Grounded Theory study design, the theory that emerged that accounted for continuance was the tutoring practices and the relationships that were built between tutor and learner. Examples from the data are presented to support the findings that link certain ways of practicing computer tutoring with repeat lesson attendance. This paper contributes to understanding the types of tutoring practices that can encourage older learners to continue the learning journey in later life. In turn, this assists with overcoming the digital divide older learners not skilled in computer use experience and allows them to participate in an increasing technologically driven society.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2010,324,,292-300,"Nycyk, Michael; Redsell, Margaret",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1006494423,0,"[Kim, Young Sek]|[]|Educational Gerontology|2008|34|8|709-735|10.1080/03601270802000576|pub.1001471239|51;[Mayhorn, Christopher B.; Stronge, Aideen J.; McLaughlin, Anne Collins; Rogers, Wendy A.]|[ur.01024437566.48; ur.016551344713.82; ur.01145262600.53; ur.01264331147.12]|Educational Gerontology|2004|30|3|185-203|10.1080/03601270490272124|pub.1007137513|83;[Seals, Cheryl D.; Clanton, Kelley; Agarwal, Ravikant; Doswell, Felicia; Thomas, Chippewa M.]|[ur.01177233420.58; ur.013637521105.68; ur.016335562222.52; ur.014031670473.62; ur.014203606526.82]|Educational Gerontology|2008|34|12|1055-1069|10.1080/03601270802290185|pub.1008726261|31;[Pfeil, Ulrike; Arjan, Raj; Zaphiris, Panayiotis]|[ur.014502304555.40; ; ur.07563527505.21]|Computers in Human Behavior|2009|25|3|643-654|10.1016/j.chb.2008.08.015|pub.1015343461|350;[Adams, Nichola; Stubbs, David; Woods, Valerie]|[; ; ]|Informatics for Health and Social Care|2005|30|1|3-17|10.1080/14639230500066876|pub.1017265918|97;[Weatherall, Jo White Ann]|[]|Educational Gerontology|2000|26|4|371-386|10.1080/036012700407857|pub.1020421970|95;[Sterns, Lisa A.

The focus of this analysis is on the drivers of demand per se, and not service growth as a function of infrastructure deployment and service availability. Indeed, given the investment required to design and deploy next generation networks, this focus raises the possibility that once networks are in-place, the price may not be affordable to most households. The policy implications of that scenario include significant (publicly funded) subsidies or increased regulation. We examine the growth in telecommunication and data services by constructing a cross-country model of countrywide expenditure shares. The analysis compares growth rates by country against the share of income allocated to communication service to infer an upper limit on potential market saturation. The analysis provides an alternative perspective on the ‘Digital Divide’ by separating the demand for advanced services into socio-economic (prices, income, demographics) and policy (universal access, availability) factors.",Contributions to Economics,2009,,,433-447,"Rappoport, Paul; Alleman, James; Madden, Gary",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1006171795,0,"[Kiiski, Sampsa; Pohjola, Matti]|[ur.012603406201.20; ur.013107663011.00]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|297-310|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00071-3|pub.1001159834|314;[Chinn, M.

The general trends identified a positive development in the growing use of ICTs in the majority of countries. The following component of this report presents an overview of general trends and specific efforts undertaken by the international community in addressing WSIS goals. The bridging the digital divide part focuses mainly on analysing the use of mobile, Internet and broadband technologies worldwide. The section on creating an enabling environment outlines regulatory reform trends and highlights the need for a fundamental shift in policy and regulatory frameworks to enable countries to achieve WSIS targets by 2015. The capacity building and ICT services part draws attention to capacity-building initiatives undertaken so far by the international community and outlines ICT services mainly focusing on e-health, e-government, e-environment and e-agriculture. The section on building security in the virtual world focuses on the real and significant risks posed by cybercrime and provides for strategic mechanisms to meet the global challenges in building confidence and security in the use of ICTs.",,2008,,,,ITU,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107207347,0,

The vast majority of the world’s population is still unable to gain access to digital technology, especially the Internet, hence the ‘digital divide’. However, this divide is not restricted to the developing world; with the divide also prevalent within the UK, again particularly in terms of internet access. A result of this situation is that while the UK and many of its citizens reap the benefits that the Internet brings, areas are left even deeper in a state of financial exclusion from mainstream banking facilities. As more people take advantage of the convenience the Internet can bring to managing financial affairs, the banking industry has identified a need for less branches and staff. From their understandable perspective it makes more sense to close unprofitable, high risk branches. These are ultimately in rural or poor inner city areas; the areas that are less likely to have Internet access. Advances in mobile phone technology could prove a solution to both.",Journal of International Trade Law and Policy,2007,6,1,21-29,"Geach, Neal",University of Hertfordshire,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1051907587,6,

This project is motivated by the Microsoft sponsored project conducted at the Department of Computer Science named IHISM for which the authors are members. IHISM aims to contribute to the digital divide by developing an HIV and AIDS public information portal accessible through mobile phones. The case study is based on Botswana, one of the leading countries hard hit by the HIV and AIDS pandemic where the government is working hard to facilitate the provision of education and raising awareness concerning the pandemic. Whilst IHISM is concentrating on the digital divide and mainly concerned with semiliterate people in rural settlements this alternative is for those who have access to the internet and hence can use the system wherever they are.

It assesses the extent to which TT, as a developing country, succeeds in its efforts to bridge the “other divide” by examining ministry Website usability variables based on Stowers’ usability dimensions. Website usability focuses on the ease with which users can find what they want on a Website and accomplish the tasks they desire. Stowers (2002) identifies six usability dimensions: online services, user-help tools, navigation features, legitimacy, information architecture, and accessibility accommodations. The study found that the Ministry of Legal Affairs and the Ministry of Trade and Industry are the highest performing ministries overall. The findings suggest that there may be implications for understanding Website usability for the Caribbean region and for government ministries in general. Finally, the study aims at stimulating further research about Caribbean government Websites that can help to reduce or eliminate the digital divides.",Integrated Series in Information Systems,2010,25,,483-504,"Roach, Charlene M.

It develops a framework that defines four types of information technologies and Internets based on four dimensions of information: physical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic. Technologies like e-mail that only make use of the first three hardly interact with the industrial infrastructure and superstructure. Nonetheless, technologies like e-commerce that require the pragmatic dimension, which is related to matter and energy (products and services) need such structures. For example, e-commerce requires a trustworthy transportation and payment infrastructure. Unfortunately, developing countries are lacking them. This differential capacity to use the pragmatic dimension of AdvIT/IS (pragmatic fragility) explains why developing countries are not able to skip industrialization and jump into the information era. This pragmatic fragility increases the existing digital divide since implementing e-business in developing countries ends up being the digitalization of bad business practices.",Global Information Technologies,2008,,,3091-3104,"Tan, Felix B.; Ferran, Carlos",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024353836,1,

This notion is examined through the lens of information as structured capital that requires Internet access to be complemented by people's information-using capabilities, inclinations, needs, knowledge, and beliefs, which must also complement each other to allow the effective use of information. Qualitative in-depth interviews with 30 senior South Koreans at a Senior Welfare Center suggest that the information capital possessed by these seniors is ill suited to responding to and taking advantage of Internet use. The social isolation of seniors provides them with neither incentives nor capabilities to restructure their information capital in the ways necessary for ongoing use. This finding sugests that digital divide policies for older people must shift their focus from technology per se toward more comprehensive approaches of dealing with the basic social needs of senior citizens.",The Korean Journal of Policy Studies,2007,22,1,113-130,"Youn Min, Park",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141813171,0,

Prior research on Internet self‐efficacy has been limited to examining specific task performance and narrow behavioral domains rather than overall attainments in relation to general Internet use, and has not yielded evidence of reliability and construct validity. Survey data were collected to develop a reliable operational measure of Internet self‐efficacy and to examine its construct validity. An eight‐item Internet self‐efficacy scale developed for the present study was found to be reliable and internally consistent. Prior Internet experience, outcome expectancies and Internet use were significantly and positively correlated to Internet self‐efficacy judgments. Internet stress and self‐disparagement were negatively related to Internet self‐efficacy.

We present a usability evaluation aiming at investigate the interaction differences between both blind and sighted users while surfing WhatsOnWeb, a search engine that displays the information by using graph-drawing methods on semantically clustered data. We compare the visual presentation of three different layouts with the sonificated ones, demonstrating both qualitatively and quantitatively that blind and sighted users perform with no significant differences the interaction. These results remark that the digital divide could be decreased by going beyond the visuocentric way of the commonly adopted visual content representation.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2010,6179,,351-357,"Mele, Maria Laura; Federici, Stefano; Borsci, Simone; Liotta, Giuseppe",Sapienza University of Rome; University of Perugia,Italy; Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043845332,3,"[Delogu, Franco; Palmiero, Massimiliano; Federici, Stefano; Plaisant, Catherine; Zhao, Haixia; Belardinelli, Olivetti]|[ur.01031451424.20; ur.01144475646.10; ur.0605453361.14; ur.01062150526.15; ur.01215014225.69; ]|Disability and Rehabilitation Assistive Technology|2010|5|3|164-174|10.3109/17483100903100277|pub.1000925499|22;[Olivetti Belardinelli, Marta; Federici, Stefano; Delogu, Franco; Palmiero, Massimiliano]|[ur.01112147730.50; ur.0605453361.14; ur.01031451424.20; ur.01144475646.10]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2009|5615||557-563|10.1007/978-3-642-02710-9_62|pub.1001054761|9;[Federici, Stefano; Borsci, Simone; Mele, Maria Laura; Stamerra, Gianluca]|[ur.0605453361.14; ur.01126333016.03; ur.0751715701.07; ur.0770015161.06]|Universal Access in the Information Society|2010|9|4|375-386|10.1007/s10209-009-0179-7|pub.1003752860|5;[Jay, Caroline; Stevens, Robert; Glencross, Mashhuda; Chalmers, Alan; Yang, Cathy]|[ur.01046531377.48; ur.0653547307.62; ur.013505200571.34; ur.0701757540.47; ]|Universal Access in the Information Society|2007|6|3|307-320|10.1007/s10209-007-0089-5|pub.1005933990|14;[Federici, Stefano; Borsci, Simone; Stamerra, Gianluca]|[ur.0605453361.14; ur.01126333016.03; ur.0770015161.06]|Cognitive Processing|2010|11|3|273-273|10.1007/s10339-010-0358-8|pub.1007447440|3;[]|[]|Australian Dental Journal|1985|30|2|134-135|10.1111/j.1834-7819.1985.tb05358.x|pub.1008492494|447;[Zhao, Haixia; Plaisant, Catherine; Shneiderman, Ben; Lazar, Jonathan]|[ur.01215014225.69; ur.01062150526.15; ur.013052653253.13; ur.013562126001.65]|ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction|2008|15|1|4|10.1145/1352782.1352786|pub.1021471317|62;[Jay, Caroline; Stevens, Robert; Glencross, Mashhuda; Chalmers, Alan]|[ur.01046531377.48; ur.0653547307.62; ur.013505200571.34; ur.0701757540.47]|Proceedings of the 2006 international cross-disciplinary workshop on Web accessibility (W4A) Building the mobile web: rediscovering accessibility? - W4A|2006|||113-120|10.1145/1133219.1133241|pub.1028152769|12;[Ivory, Melody Y.; Yu, Shiqing; Gronemyer, Kathryn]|[ur.010602764205.40; ; ]|Extended abstracts of the 2004 conference on Human factors and computing systems  - CHI '04|2004|||1453-1456|10.1145/985921.986088|pub.1034120848|35;[Avraamides, Marios N.; Loomis, Jack M.; Klatzky, Roberta L.; Golledge, Reginald G.]|[ur.01154723035.21; ur.0724772025.77; ur.01056165235.87; ur.0615605470.14]|Journal of Experimental Psychology Learning Memory and Cognition|2004|30|4|801-814|10.1037/0278-7393.30.4.804|pub.1036822943|98;[Stefano, Federici; Borsci, Simone; Stamerra, Gianluca]|[; ur.01126333016.03; ur.0770015161.06]|Cognitive Processing|2009|11|3|263-272|10.1007/s10339-009-0347-y|pub.1041818357|17;[Borsci, Simone; Federici, Stefano; Lauriola, Marco]|[ur.01126333016.03; ur.0605453361.14; ur.01145463730.04]|Cognitive Processing|2009|10|3|193-197|10.1007/s10339-009-0268-9|pub.1046484957|148;[Rugo, Alessio; Mele, Maria Laura; Liotta, Giuseppe; Trotta, Francesco; Di Giacomo, Emilio; Borsci, Simone; Federici, Stefano]|[; ur.0751715701.07; ur.0616776646.71; ur.015203722514.06; ur.011623337121.69; ur.01126333016.03; ur.0605453361.14]|Cognitive Processing|2009|10|Suppl 2|286-289|10.1007/s10339-009-0317-4|pub.1047313111|1;[Bryant, David J.]|[ur.01001104612.43]|Behavioral and Brain Sciences|1993|16|2|241-242|10.1017/s0140525x00029770|pub.1054866278|4;[Atkinson, Richard C.; Shiffrin, Richard M.]|[; ]|Scientific American|1971|225|2|82-90|10.1038/scientificamerican0871-82|pub.1056586153|792;[Di Giacomo, Emilio; Didimo, Walter; Grilli, Luca; Liotta, Giuseppe]|[ur.011623337121.69; ur.012441113506.57; ur.010357143503.51; ur.0616776646.71]|IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics|2007|13|2|294-304|10.1109/tvcg.2007.40|pub.1061812817|54;[Perkis, Tim; Kramer, Gregory]|[; ]|Computer Music Journal|1995|19|2|110|10.2307/3680606|pub.1070407937|45;[Di Giacomo, Emilio; Didimo, Walter; Grilli, Luca; Liotta, Giuseppe; Palladino, Pietro]|[ur.011623337121.69; ur.012441113506.57; ur.010357143503.51; ur.0616776646.71; ur.01235641357.95]|2008 IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium|2008|||167-174|10.1109/pacificvis.2008.4475473|pub.1093470330|6;[Millar, Susanna]|[]||1994||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198521426.001.0001|pub.1098736061|238"
pub.1032527875,10.1177/0276146708325386,Exploring the Digital Divide in Mobile-phone Adoption Levels across Countries,"Although the adoption of mobile phones has been skyrocketing globally during the current decade, present adoption levels are quite uneven across countries. Such disparities are also found over a range of other information and communications technologies and have been characterized as a “digital divide.” Although the adoption of mobile phones has been the focus of numerous studies, relatively few have systematically and comprehensively investigated the adoption of this technological innovation at the country level of analysis and over a broad range of nations. This study addresses this research gap by examining the effects of three country-level socioeconomic factors paralleling the individual-level demographic traits that in past studies have predominantly predicted early adoption of innovations. We rely on secondary data obtained from several reputable sources to examine this phenomenon across 170 nations. Theoretical, managerial, and policy implications based on our empirical findings, along with directions for future research, are presented.",Journal of Macromarketing,2008,28,4,397-412,"Stump, Rodney L.; Wen Gong; Zhan Li",Towson University; Howard University; University of San Francisco,United States; United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032527875,27,"[Gruber, Harald; Verboven, Frank]|[ur.015777374105.67; ur.016512144251.48]|European Economic Review|2001|45|3|577-588|10.1016/s0014-2921(00)00068-4|pub.1000268382|262;[Quibria, M.G; Ahmed, Shamsun N; Tschang, Ted; Reyes-Macasaquit, Mari-Len]|[ur.015764721413.10; ur.010654611213.10; ur.012247552213.80; ur.015235454213.44]|Journal of Asian Economics|2003|13|6|811-825|10.1016/s1049-0078(02)00186-0|pub.1000815131|147;[Kiiski, Sampsa; Pohjola, Matti]|[ur.012603406201.20; ur.013107663011.00]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|297-310|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00071-3|pub.1001159834|314;[Dholakia, Ruby Roy; Dholakia, Nikhilesh]|[ur.014004014271.17; ur.013327347110.55]|Journal of Business Research|2004|57|12|1391-1396|10.1016/s0148-2963(02)00427-7|pub.1002170604|95;[Cornwell, T.

The four networks are compared across various network architecture dimensions. Our analysis indicates that LINCOS offers reduced capital cost, flexible architectures, and at the same time access to worldwide information systems, and hence has the highest potential to reach effectively the most excluded population in developing countries. Collaborations among technology marketers, national governments and international agencies are needed to identify the needs of the digitally excluded population and select appropriate architectures to serve the needs.",Global Information Technologies,2008,,,928-943,"Tan, Felix B.; Dholakia, Nikhilesh; Kshetri, Nir",University of Rhode Island,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018604943,0,

Though e‐governance is capable enough of reaching to its objective, the problem of last mile connection is still persistent in developing countries due to unavailability of required infrastructure to provide e‐governance with required depth. It has been witnessed that developing countries have deeper telephonic/mobile penetration than the internet penetration. Hence the use of telephone/mobile as a tool to supplement e‐governance in its last leg becomes imperative. The higher level penetration of mobile connection makes the problem of last mile connectivity somehow redundant. Mobile‐governance (m‐governance) may be used as supplement to e‐governance in a spoke and hub model. It will be helpful in bridging the digital divide particularly in rural areas and also in developing parts of world mainly Asia and Africa. This paper discusses e‐governance and m‐governance in a spoke and hub model. A generic process will be helpful for faster replication of services and greater penetration.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2007,31,1,1-14,"Narayan, Gyanendra",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099629151,10,"[Katz, James; Aspden, Philip]|[ur.011125014303.05; ur.011004276717.53]|Communications of the ACM|1997|40|4|97-102|10.1145/248448.248464|pub.1039508061|62"
pub.1095920818,10.28945/2684,Rethinking Social and Economic Development: Promoting Digital Literacy,"Today’s digital divide that separates the “haves” and the “have nots” is attributed in part to geography, race, income, employment, age, gender, and education. Not only do some segments of the population remain unconnected, but these sectors also have no desire to connect. Thus, the connected portions of the world must create an urge and necessity to connect so that even the most remote location can access the same information as countries with technological enrichment. The first step towards worldwide connectivity involves worldwide understanding, achieved through information literacy, therefore allowing each person to become an independent, self-sufficient user. These characteristics lead to a better education, where the user can reap the benefits of schooling and life experience because of information literacy skills. The most important reward is an overall improved life where the Internet no longer separates people, but instead brings them together for work, communication, and leisure. These goals can only be accomplished through a collaborative effort involving both those connected, and those not connected. Without cooperation from both sides, the digital divide will continue existing.",InSITE Conference,2003,,,,"Amiri, Shahram",Stetson University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095920818,0,

Students have been attending e-learning programs worldwide. For example, students in Turkey have increasingly been using this technology to attend e-MBA programs. Due to constraints like lecturers, ability to use technology and the infrastructure of information technologies in current education systems it is not possible to reach high levels of higher education. In this paper, the authors measure lecturers’ behaviors toward e-learning activities. The study gauges their ability to use information technology, perceptions about the advantages of e-learning program, and readiness for the transition. Data are provided from a survey conducted in the School of Business Administration at Istanbul University. Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests are used to analyze the data.

pub.1139274474,10.29173/irie255,"Universalisation, Totality and ICT, or: Are there any reasons for demanding ICT-free areas?","In the following contribution we will investigate the digital divide with respect to a philosophically and ideologically founded concept of universalisation. The documents of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) show that the creation of a global information society not only concerns a technical structural transformation, but also a technical implementation of a normative guiding principle. I will show that overcoming the digital divide corresponds to the inner logic of universalisation as an ethical model of reasoning. Furthermore, we will see that in reality this formal approach to reasoning proves to be a means of realising certain ideological perspectives. This interdependency of cultural dispositions and technical developments in the global information society will be shown in five aspects: • The creation of a global social utopia based on the concept of the information society. • The objectification of the concept of universalisation in information and communication technology (ICT). • The linking of global internet use to a normative idea of the public sphere. • The tendency towards totality as a problem of the public sphere and ICT. • Possible reasons for demanding ICT-free areas.",The International Review of Information Ethics,2004,2,,,"Heesen, Jessica",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139274474,0,

From this perspective, individuals from underrepresented groups can make it alongside individuals of wealth and privilege. All that is necessary is education and training, perseverance, and painstaking effort. But if as some argue, it is not a level playing field, then how do various underrepresented groups cope and compete within this power structure? To find this out, a critical analysis of the responses from underrepresented groups to the dominant discourses about power and IT was carried out. A conceptual framework based upon a study of African-American men and women in low income urban communities was applied to the findings of two different studies of gender in the IT profession. The results show a consistent pattern of response across underrepresented groups. In addition, these findings suggest that positive interventions can be applied across underrepresented groups so that IT does not become simply the latest mechanism for stratifying society.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2003,110,,273-291,"Kvasny, Lynette; Trauth, Eileen M.",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001667144,19,"[McChesney, Robert W.]|[ur.014747253342.93]|Journal of Communication|1996|46|1|98-124|10.1111/j.1460-2466.1996.tb01463.x|pub.1040270351|92;[von Hellens, Liisa A.; Nielsen, Sue H.; Trauth, Eileen M.]|[ur.010430272613.33; ur.014147725327.56; ur.07421642022.90]|Proceedings of the 2001 ACM SIGCPR conference on Computer personnel research  - SIGCPR '01|2001|||116-120|10.1145/371209.371535|pub.1049690034|32;[Trauth, Eileen M.]|[ur.07421642022.90]||2000||||10.1007/978-94-010-9836-6|pub.1052502155|52;[Schwalbe, M.; Holden, D.; Schrock, D.; Godwin, S.; Thompson, S.; Wolkomir, M.]|[ur.07724434733.35; ur.012566437417.50; ur.0664712434.89; ur.010437301503.68; ur.012032242503.33; ur.013425203503.50]|Social Forces|2000|79|2|419-452|10.1093/sf/79.2.419|pub.1060034650|257;[Trauth, Eileen M.]|[]|Éire-Ireland|1995|30|3|133-150|10.1353/eir.1995.0008|pub.1091474799|18;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]||2001||||10.1017/cbo9781139164887|pub.1098663486|2054"

An Analysis of Two Western Australian Cases,"In Australia, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), particularly rural SMEs, are perceived as being on the wrong side of the digital divide. Government at local and state levels has taken a leading role in the development of electronic marketplaces with an aim of improving SME participation. Many government departments now either own or sponsor electronic marketplaces. The aims of government agencies in creating e‐marketplaces are often motivated by regional economic development issues. Whilst government entities may think e‐marketplaces are an effective channel for implementing government policy, a number of complications can arise from this model. Despite the community development motivation, a major argument for e‐marketplace development being put forward is the economic one and this has contributed to a narrow view of the e‐marketplace concept and one, which for the time being at least, is likely to restrict its impact. Government sponsored e‐marketplaces should consider the value of on‐line business networks to share knowledge and potentially increase levels of innovation. The findings have implications for government sponsored e‐marketplace initiatives around the world.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2004,20,1,1-14,"Standing, Craig; Sims, Ian; Stockdale, Rosemary; Gengatharen, Denise; Standing, Susan; Wassenaar, Arjen",Edith Cowan University; University of Twente,Australia; Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099632717,4,"[Grewal, Rajdeep; Comer, James M.; Mehta, Raj]|[ur.013243536107.11; ur.010100647067.45; ur.014250235776.42]|Journal of Marketing|2001|65|3|17-33|10.1509/jmkg.65.3.17.18331|pub.1003259275|239;[Lee, Ho-Guen]|[ur.016131420050.32]|Communications of the ACM|1998|41|1|73-80|10.1145/268092.268122|pub.1005305235|216;[Jarvenpaa, Sirkka L.; Tractinsky, Noam; Vitale, Michael]|[ur.011671157162.31; ur.010235653567.65; ]|Information Technology and Management|2000|1|1-2|45-71|10.1023/a:1019104520776|pub.1006405367|1464;[Bebko, Charlene Pleger]|[ur.012736763405.09]|Journal of Services Marketing|2000|14|1|9-26|10.1108/08876040010309185|pub.1006894731|186;[Stokes, Andrea]|[]|International Small Business Journal Researching Entrepreneurship|2000|19|1|100-102|10.1177/0266242600191007|pub.1016843083|4;[van Akkeren, Jeanette K.; Cavaye, Angèle L.M.]|[ur.013621715367.30; ur.015214656367.74]|Journal of Systems and Information Technology|1999|3|2|33-48|10.1108/13287269980000747|pub.1019199478|36;[Tetteh, Emmanuel; Burn, Janice]|[ur.010701253035.79; ur.07353464643.84]|Logistics Information Management|2001|14|1/2|171-180|10.1108/09576050110363202|pub.1022004068|95;[Finch, Janet]|[]|Sociology|1987|21|1|105-114|10.1177/0038038587021001008|pub.1024971136|603;[Sherer, Susan A.]|[ur.01326220570.07]|Journal of Small Business Management|2003|41|4|325-345|10.1111/1540-627x.00086|pub.1036528962|107;[Brunn, Peter; Jensen, Martin; Skovgaard, Jakob]|[; ; ]|European Management Journal|2002|20|3|286-298|10.1016/s0263-2373(02)00045-2|pub.1042456448|107;[Lewis, Rhiannon; Cockrill, Antje]|[; ur.013156226255.61]|International Journal of Information Management|2002|22|3|195-209|10.1016/s0268-4012(02)00005-1|pub.1046359333|58;[Poon, Simpson; Swatman, Paula M.C]|[ur.016544440117.34; ur.016563750073.91]|Information & Management|1999|35|1|9-18|10.1016/s0378-7206(98)00079-2|pub.1052707847|302;[Granovetter, Mark]|[]|American Journal of Sociology|1985|91|3|481-510|10.1086/228311|pub.1058547809|17696;[Williamson, Oliver E.]|[ur.011657615514.15]|The Journal of Law and Economics|1979|22|2|233-261|10.1086/466942|pub.1058751592|5578;[Jarvenpaa, Sirkka L.; Tractinsky, Noam; Saarinen, Lauri]|[ur.011671157162.31; ur.010235653567.65; ]|Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|2006|5|2|0-0|10.1111/j.1083-6101.1999.tb00337.x|pub.1061923602|912;[Lucking-Reiley, David; Spulber, Daniel F]|[ur.013065052425.93; ur.013562453163.17]|Journal of Economic Perspectives|2001|15|1|55-68|10.1257/jep.15.1.55|pub.1064530114|198;[Bakos, J.

In this paper we examine its manifestation in the area of south eastern Europe which is in a less advanced position compared to western Europe. We use data from 8 countries, collected from local key stakeholders such as government agencies and professional bodies. We use a framework developed by King et al. (1994) regarding institutional actions related to IT diffusion and examine the ones pursued by regional policy makers for the diffusion of electronic commerce. The data are presented by using SWOT analysis with the view to portray the situation of electronic commerce adoption in each country under investigation. A collective analysis of the research findings offers the possibility to extract the ""success factors "" in government intervention in supporting electronic commerce diffusion.

In the early parts of the paper we argue that, although GNU/LINUX can generate substantial savings when used instead of the proprietary alternative in numerous institutional settings, the most telling opportunities for developing countries arise when this system is combined with other ways of reducing computing costs. Policy, therfore, should not only consist of substituting GNU/LINUX for proprietary software in running the latest and most expensive hardware, but also of lowering these latter costs themselves. Later sections focus on the link between the choice of software and path-dependency (i.e. the notion that if one system gets ahead, it tends to lock out alternatives in the manner described by Brian Arthur). We suggest that the problem of proprietary lock-in in developing countries has been greatly accentuated by piracy of Microsoft operating systems and that the result is a stagnation of the technological capabilities in software that these countries need so badly.",Journal of Information Science,2003,29,1,25-33,"James, Jeffrey",Tilburg University,Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1036149826,15,"[Lall, Sanjaya]|[ur.010556073043.73]|World Development|1992|20|2|165-186|10.1016/0305-750x(92)90097-f|pub.1043829538|1175;[James, Jeffrey]|[]|Journal of Information Science|2001|27|6|385-392|10.1177/016555150102700604|pub.1063750837|17;[Arthur, W B]|[]|Harvard Business Review|1996|74|4|100-9||pub.1074326125|573"

Useful solutions when trying to “bridge” the digital divide should include collaboration with local groups in order to better understand and meet their needs (Eglash, 2004). The most far-reaching examples of these community-oriented, information and communication technology (ICT) products and services result in social and economic impacts beyond just the use of technology—sometimes referred to as community informatics. This paper offers one such solution where an extremely cost—effective, community-based ICT program was successfully piloted in order to improve the computer and digital multimedia literacy of at-risk teenagers, provide job skills, open up new career opportunities, and begin to improve the overall economic capital of the community. While piloted in an inner-city, the program represents a best practice that is equally applicable to a small rural setting or to a regional educational initiative.

pub.1008085051,10.1002/itdj.20124,A cross‐country comparative analysis of e‐government service delivery among Arab countries,"Much of the existing e-government research focuses on developed countries. Although a relatively small number of studies explored Arab e-government development, they did so in a single country context. This article provides an insight into the current state of Arab e-government developments. A cross-country comparative analysis of e-government Web sites and portals was conducted on 16 Arab countries to assess their development stages in e-government service delivery capability. Further comparative analysis was performed between the top Arab e-governments and the global top e-governments in developed countries with regard to “e-democracy,” often the highest level e-government service delivery capability identified in the literature. The results confirm a wide digital divide that remains between the Arab countries and the leading developed countries. Importantly, however, the results also show a wide digital divide even among the Arab countries studied, particularly in the development of advanced e-government service delivery capabilities. These results have important implications for developing countries in managing both economic and non-economic resources effectively for successful e-government development. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Information Technology for Development,2009,15,3,151-170,"Chatfield, Akemi Takeoka; Alhujran, Omar",University of Wollongong,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1008085051,66,"[Gefen, David; Rose, Gregory M.; Warkentin, Merrill; Pavlou, Paul A.]|[ur.010724440512.07; ur.012601410205.94; ur.014404213724.32; ur.016166254325.43]|Journal of Global Information Management|2005|13|1|54-78|10.4018/jgim.2005010103|pub.1003512069|110;[Lee, Sang M.; Tan, Xin; Trimi, Silvana]|[ur.010605430361.02; ; ur.010664037513.94]|Communications of the ACM|2005|48|10|99-104|10.1145/1089107.1089112|pub.1003732488|224;[Ciborra, Claudio; Navarra, Diego D.]|[ur.015442753233.08; ur.012522432543.75]|Information Technology for Development|2005|11|2|141-159|10.1002/itdj.20008|pub.1006325321|136;[Aladwani, Adel M.]|[ur.010357757323.61]|Information Technology and People|2003|16|1|9-20|10.1108/09593840310462998|pub.1013273112|47;[Siau, Keng; Long, Yuan]|[ur.010113560575.56; ur.013543564701.13]|Industrial Management & Data Systems|2005|105|4|443-458|10.1108/02635570510592352|pub.1018012512|245;[King, John Leslie; Kraemer, Kenneth L.]|[ur.010530156121.64; ur.01003675072.26]|Communications of the ACM|1984|27|5|466-475|10.1145/358189.358074|pub.1026900967|169;[Bertot, John Carlo]|[ur.011253735727.32]|Government Information Quarterly|2003|20|2|185-191|10.1016/s0740-624x(03)00036-4|pub.1027199920|96;[Moon, M.

In the context of community health care, scenarios in the Afya project as a socially grounded planning and design methodology have taken the form of personal narratives of Black women that capture their social experiences and typical problematic health situations. Scenarios of Black women point towards the need to foster social justice by nurturing equitable and participative social activities around technological development and use associated with health information services. Scenarios also suggest specific action-oriented strategies for empowering Black women to build social and digital technologies that we hope will make the provision of health care in our community more just.",Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,2002,53,14,1259-1266,"Mehra, Bharat; Bishop, Ann Peterson; Bazzell, Imani; Smith, Cynthia",University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Parkland College,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007361510,18,"[Chin, George; Rosson, Mary Beth; Carroll, John M.]|[ur.011211010675.12; ur.01216337450.03; ur.07616047675.26]|Proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human factors in computing systems|1997|||162-169|10.1145/258549.258654|pub.1006477237|43;[Wixon, Dennis; Holtzblatt, Karen; Knox, Stephen]|[ur.014406362352.49; ur.015226645506.15; ]|Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems Empowering people - CHI '90|1990|||329-336|10.1145/97243.97304|pub.1012105833|96;[Holtzblatt, Karen; Beyer, Hugh]|[ur.015226645506.15; ur.016026714052.47]|Communications of the ACM|1993|36|10|92-103|10.1145/163430.164050|pub.1017098166|118;[Plaut, Thomas; Landis, Suzanne; Trevor, June]|[ur.07735451433.37; ur.010533032033.32; ur.011330412433.21]|The American Sociologist|1992|23|4|56-70|10.1007/bf02691931|pub.1021180438|17;[Whiteside, John; Bennett, John; Holtzblatt, Karen]|[ur.012213444525.73; ; ur.015776727125.51]|Handbook of Human-Computer Interaction|1988||Collaboration of UIMS Designers and Human Factors Specialists Computer Graphics, (SIGGRAPH), 21, ACM, New York2April 1987|791-817|10.1016/b978-0-444-70536-5.50041-5|pub.1026977159|317;[Chavis, David M.; Wandersman, Abraham]|[ur.01355724310.64; ur.0732776556.50]|American Journal of Community Psychology|1990|18|1|55-81|10.1007/bf00922689|pub.1027451383|714;[Anyanwu, C N]|[]|Community Development Journal|1988|23|1|11-5|10.1093/cdj/23.1.11|pub.1059456057|17;[Bishop, Ann Peterson; Bazzell, Imani; Mehra, Bharat; Smith, Cynthia]|[ur.014126753237.06; ur.014724333637.32; ur.013014076227.10; ]|First Monday|2001|6|4||10.5210/fm.v6i4.847|pub.1072710651|11"
pub.1048603919,10.1080/02681102.2010.498409,When does ICT support education in South Africa? The importance of teachers' capabilities and the relevance of language,"The aim of this paper is to highlight some of the challenges of information and communication technology (ICT) integration in a South African classroom setting. The main focus is on the concept of a digital divide, and how cultural complexity with special emphasis on language can affect the divide in schools that already have material access to ICT. The study is based on fieldwork in seventh-grade classes in four primary schools in Cape Town, South Africa. The learners answered a questionnaire regarding their ICT use and skills, and interviews were conducted with learners, teachers, and principals. In conclusion, it is argued that the challenges of language in South African schools can exacerbate or maintain the digital divide among learners who are already disadvantaged due to a range of social inequalities. For learners to fully master the use of ICT in today's global knowledge society, it needs to be put in a local context, which includes use in a familiar language. Moreover, it is suggested that greater opportunities for teacher training are needed in order to enhance culturally sensitive and appropriate ICT integration based on local needs and capacity.",Information Technology for Development,2010,16,3,174-190,"Gudmundsdottir, G.

pub.1016618440,10.1007/3-540-46422-0_13,Reconfiguring Community Networks: The Case of PrairieKNOW,"The advent of the Web has renewed interest in the use of information and communication technologies to support not only virtual communities but also traditional communities. This paper observes that the majority of successful applications to date tend to use technologies to substitute for and/or enlarge existing community interactions and transactions. We argue that this trend, unfortunately, deepens the digital divide between those who have social and knowledge capital and those who don’t. In order to improve the conditions of low-income residents, there is a need to deploy tools that help to reconfigure rather than simply substitute or enlarge existing community interactions. This paper describes the methodology of asset mapping and the development and deployment of a tool called PrairieKNOW (Prairie Knowledge Networks On the Web) in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois’ Prairienet community network. While Champaign-Urbana was ranked by Newsweek magazine as one of the ten most wired cities in the world, it also has a substantial low-income population that has traditionally been under-represented in their use of Prairienet.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2000,1765,,151-164,"Contractor, Noshir; Bishop, Ann Peterson",University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016618440,22,"[van den Besselaar, Peter; Beckers, Dennis]|[ur.012114761217.04; ur.013162221071.31]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|1998|1519||108-124|10.1007/3-540-49247-x_8|pub.1003536342|36;[Virnoche, Mary E.]|[ur.012600762251.31]|Science Technology & Human Values|1998|23|2|199-220|10.1177/016224399802300203|pub.1004384054|22;[Cohen, Michael D.; Axelrod, Robert]|[; ur.01233670303.42]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|1998|1519||16-43|10.1007/3-540-49247-x_3|pub.1009680474|4;[Malone, Thomas W.; Rockart, John F.]|[ur.0607630534.01; ur.014440025122.99]|Scientific American|1991|265|3|128-136|10.1038/scientificamerican0991-128|pub.1010901087|190;[Malone, Thomas W.; Crowston, Kevin]|[ur.0607630534.01; ur.07357674455.35]|Proceedings of the 1990 ACM conference on Computer-supported cooperative work  - CSCW '90|1990|||357-370|10.1145/99332.99367|pub.1017392093|459;[Contractor, Noshir S.; Zink, Daniel; Chan, Michael]|[ur.0756762664.21; ; ]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|1998|1519||201-217|10.1007/3-540-49247-x_14|pub.1042431689|45;[Chaskin, Robert J.]|[]|Social Service Review|1997|71|4|521-547|10.1086/604277|pub.1058809747|168;[Venkatesh, Sudhir Alladi]|[ur.010766137251.17]|Social Service Review|1997|71|4|574-606|10.1086/604279|pub.1058809749|16;[MONGE, PETER R.; CONTRACTOR, NOSHIR S.]|[ur.015273277007.83; ur.0756762664.21]|The New Handbook of Organizational Communication|2001|||440-502|10.4135/9781412986243.n12|pub.1087892178|406;[]|[]|High Technology and Low-Income Communities|1998||||10.7551/mitpress/3504.003.0006|pub.1110922859|3;[]|[]|High Technology and Low-Income Communities|1998||||10.7551/mitpress/3504.003.0010|pub.1110922862|7;[]|[]|High Technology and Low-Income Communities|1998||||10.7551/mitpress/3504.003.0017|pub.1110922869|4;[]|[]|America Calling|1992||||10.1525/9780520915008|pub.1135926927|387"
pub.1016503606,10.1007/978-1-4419-6536-3_26,"E-government in New Zealand: Local Governments, Digital Divides and the National Digital Strategy","Research carried out in 2009 on New Zealand’s local government e-readiness with respect to the national digital strategy has discovered that there is a wide maturity range. In the first part of this chapter, an e-readiness maturity model is presented that indicates to what extent local governments, both urban and rural have met the national strategy guidelines. These results are contextualised within the international literature on local e-government maturity.In the second part of this chapter, challenges for four diverse and marginalised user groups are considered. Factors that affect end-users in New Zealand include: inequitable infrastructure provision, a shift in emphasis and ownership of technical knowledge and skills required to gain access to government services, and the differences in benefits and challenges for both majority and minority end-user groups. This analysis has been embedded in a theoretical framework informed by social informatics (Sawyer, 2005), digital inclusion/exclusion models (Cushman & McLean, 2008), boundary conditioning modelling (Cordoba & Midgley, 2008) and an e-government to e-governance model proposed by Dawes (2008).",Integrated Series in Information Systems,2010,25,,505-524,"Fielden, Kay; Malcolm, Pam",Unitec Institute of Technology,New Zealand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016503606,0,"[Asgarkhani, Mehdi]|[ur.012636444146.46]|Journal of Technology in Human Services|2007|25|1-2|127-146|10.1300/j017v25n01_09|pub.1001923509|18;[Becker, Shirley Ann]|[ur.0661660014.53]|ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction|2004|11|4|387-406|10.1145/1035575.1035578|pub.1009958418|163;[Hill, Rebecca; Beynon‐Davies, Paul; Williams, Michael D.]|[ur.010533475474.62; ur.011263571011.65; ur.011356650655.30]|Information Technology and People|2008|21|3|244-266|10.1108/09593840810896019|pub.1012062984|80;[Córdoba, José-Rodrigo; Midgley, Gerald]|[ur.014727512621.66; ur.015525073221.69]|European Journal of Information Systems|2008|17|2|125-142|10.1057/ejis.2008.4|pub.1016835958|33;[Letch, Nick; Carroll, Jennie]|[ur.07775424343.12; ur.011460373621.68]|Information Technology and People|2008|21|3|283-299|10.1108/09593840810896037|pub.1021951601|12;[Newell, Alan F.; Dickinson, Anna; Smith, Mick J.; Gregor, Peter]|[ur.010243237677.29; ur.011147554751.22; ; ur.016326000351.41]|ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction|2006|13|3|347-375|10.1145/1183456.1183459|pub.1026802533|56;[Crang, Michael; Crosbie, Tracey; Graham, Stephen]|[ur.015402431577.60; ur.012126504035.97; ur.013575437707.27]|Urban Studies|2006|43|13|2551-2570|10.1080/00420980600970664|pub.1037097790|89;[Dickinson, Anna; Smith, Michael J.; Arnott, John L.; Newell, Alan F.; Hill, Robin L.]|[ur.011147554751.22; ur.013470472355.25; ur.013055144375.85; ur.010243237677.29; ur.010550703555.39]|Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|2007|||281-290|10.1145/1240624.1240670|pub.1038646241|27;[Willis, Suzanne; Tranter, Bruce]|[; ur.01310032343.29]|Journal of Sociology|2006|42|1|43-59|10.1177/1440783306061352|pub.1041325554|102;[Mansourian, Yazdan]|[ur.011324115401.34]|Aslib Journal of Information Management|2008|60|4|349-363|10.1108/00012530810887980|pub.1042469927|8;[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|Journal of Aging Studies|2004|18|4|369-384|10.1016/j.jaging.2004.06.008|pub.1045693796|312;[Kurniawan, Sri; Zaphiris, Panayiotis]|[ur.01234311674.84; ur.07563527505.21]|Proceedings of the 7th international ACM SIGACCESS conference on Computers and accessibility - Assets '05|2005|||129-135|10.1145/1090785.1090810|pub.1046458376|128;[Cushman, Mike; McLean, Rachel]|[ur.010461160515.99; ]|Information Technology and People|2008|21|3|213-221|10.1108/09593840810895993|pub.1053460363|17;[Rubaii-Barrett, Nadia; Wise, Lois Recascino]|[ur.011605675065.48; ur.07631402457.29]|Journal of Disability Policy Studies|2008|19|1|52-64|10.1177/1044207307311533|pub.1063924324|36;[Riggins, Frederick; Dewan, Sanjeev]|[; ]|Journal of the Association for Information Systems|2005|6|12|298-337|10.17705/1jais.00074|pub.1100731533|295;[Dutton, William H.; Peltu, Malcolm]|[ur.014650741236.96; ur.012471563332.27]|SSRN Electronic Journal|2007||||10.2139/ssrn.1295337|pub.1102257126|16;[Lips, Miriam]|[]|Policy Quarterly|2008|4|2||10.26686/pq.v4i2.4255|pub.1106980105|5"

It has been shown that the use of ICT can help students develop inquiry and thinking skills, increase learning opportunities, enhance learning activities, and improve learning outcomes for students. While there are bright prospects, barriers still exist in certain areas, particularly the readiness of the teachers who will adopt the technology, administrative support and technology infrastructure in schools. This study reports the patterns of computer use and computer self-efficacy among students in a postgraduate degree in education program in the UAE. The survey from 91 students were analysed and found that most students have positive attitudes and beliefs in ICT, but lacking behind the use of such technologies.

This article fine-tunes these approximations by estimating the amount of digital information that is stored, communicated, and computed by these devices. The installed stock of ICT equipment in the consumer segment is multiplied with its corresponding technological performance, resulting in the “installed technological capacity” for storage (in bits), bandwidth (in bits per second), and computational power (in computations per second). This leads to new insights. Despite the rapidly decreasing digital equipment divide, there is an increasing gap in terms of information-processing capacity. It is shown that in 1996 the average inhabitant of the industrialized countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) had a capacity of 49 kibps more than its counterpart from Latin America and the Caribbean. Ten years later, this gap widened to 577 kibps per inhabitant.

The government sector (and especially the local government sector) needs to embrace information and communication technologies (ICTs) that enable it to operate more efficiently and communicate better with its citizens. ICTs encompass all technologies that facilitate the processing and transfer of information and communication services (United Nations, 2002). Many factors affect how local governments (i.e., municipalities) in developing countries access ICTs. In order to bridge the digital divide?which separates the technology ‘haves’ from the technology ‘have nots’?it is necessary to gauge where citizens are in terms of ICT adoption, that is, their e-readiness. E-readiness can be defined in terms of availability of ICT infrastructure, the accessibility of ICT to the general citizen population, and the effect of the legal and regulatory framework on ICT use in, for example, an e-government strategy. eThekwini Municipality (2003), in the city of Durban in the developing country of South Africa, sees the e-government strategy and its Web site at http://www.durban.gov.za as important management tools for improved citizen service delivery and communication. The objective of this article is to report, as an example, on the survey of ICT and information needs of a selected metropolitan municipal area (eThekwini Municipality in South Africa). Such a report maybe useful to other municipalities in developing countries for their egovernment strategies. This article is organized as follows. The background to e-government and the digital divide are discussed. eThekwini Municipality in South Africa is then described. The research goals are outlined, the research method and data gathering are discussed, the survey results and discussion are given, and future trends for implementing an e-government strategy in municipalities in developing countries are suggested. Finally, a conclusion is given.","Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, Second Edition",2009,,,1310-1317,"Khosrow-Pour, Mehdi; Averweg, Udo Richard",University of KwaZulu-Natal,South Africa,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1006530619,0,"[VAN LIESHOUT, M.

Most schools have incorporated computers and Internet access into classrooms, partly in response to concerns about the gap between technology “haves” and “have nots” ( Facer et al., 2001 ). Such concerns have led to high-profile information technology policy initiatives in the USA (Lentz, 2000; US Department of Commerce, 1999), U.K. ( Selwyn, 2000 ), Australia ( Foster, 2000 ) and other nations. Many families have invested in computer systems at home in order to provide their children with access to the growing body of information available through technology. Similarly, in an attempt to “redress the balance between the information rich and poor” by providing “equal access to the World Wide Web” ( Virtual Communities, 2002 ), the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), Virtual Communities (a computer/software distributor) and Primus (an Internet provider) in late 1999 formed an alliance to offer relatively inexpensive computer and Internet access to union members in order to make “technology affordable for all Australians” ( Virtual Communities, 2002 ).",Studies in Educational Ethnography,2004,Volume 9,Issue see/2004/s1529-210x(2004)9/s1529-210x(2004)9/production,45-66,"Angus, Lawrence; Sutherland-Smith, Wendy; Snyder, Ilana",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034817845,0,"[]|[]|Current Sociology|1997|45|4|115-128|10.1177/001139297045004007|pub.1003919366|2;[Garnham, Nicholas]|[]|Information Communication & Society|2000|3|2|139-152|10.1080/13691180050123677|pub.1006702775|49;[Facer, Keri; Furlong, John; Furlong, Ruth; Sutherland, Rosamund]|[ur.01221066300.33; ur.012574762017.25; ur.010506710607.53; ur.0654777270.81]|British Journal of Sociology of Education|2001|22|1|91-108|10.1080/01425690123324|pub.1008103719|38;[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|British Journal of Sociology of Education|2000|21|2|243-255|10.1080/713655340|pub.1010701311|20;[Holloway, Darren]|[]|Australian Journal of Social Issues|2002|37|1|51-69|10.1002/j.1839-4655.2002.tb01110.x|pub.1011500479|11;[Lentz, R.G.]|[]|Info|2000|2|4|355-377|10.1108/14636690010801609|pub.1014492307|21;[FOSTER, STEPHEN PAUL]|[]|The International Information & Library Review|2000|32|3-4|437-451|10.1006/iilr.2000.0136|pub.1015083004|15;[Webb, Stephen]|[ur.01110006442.68]|Information Communication & Society|2001|4|4|560-594|10.1080/13691180110097012|pub.1025700376|31;[Van Rompaey, Veerle; Roe, Keith; Struys, Karin]|[ur.012206032003.61; ur.014631142243.51; ]|Information Communication & Society|2002|5|2|189-206|10.1080/13691180210130770|pub.1030283629|46;[Reay, Diane]|[]|Journal of Education Policy|2001|16|4|333-346|10.1080/02680930110054335|pub.1030735751|364;[Ball, Stephen J.; Davies, Jackie; David, Miriam; Reay, Diane]|[ur.01263365770.46; ; ur.014740604775.37; ur.011521440757.53]|British Journal of Sociology of Education|2002|23|1|51-72|10.1080/01425690120102854|pub.1043339236|344;[Hellman, Heikki]|[ur.013454453506.13]|European Journal of Communication|1996|11|1|5-32|10.1177/0267323196011001001|pub.1063797549|8"

Two assessments were used including 1) a Quality of life questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF Taiwan) and 2) a questionnaire relating to computer and internet use developed specifically for this study. The results show that there was a statistically significant difference in environment domain of quality of life between people who use computers and people who do not use computers in their daily life (p=.029). There was no statistically significant difference in the physical, psychological and social relationship domains of quality of life. Occupational therapists may help people with chronic mental illness to engage in meaningful activities through using the computer as ordinary part of their daily lives and in order to improve their perception of quality of life.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2009,5614,,361-365,"Huang, Yan-hua; Su, I-Ju","California State University, Dominguez Hills; Taipei Medical University",United States; Taiwan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024049323,3,"[Huang, Yan-hua; Wu, Ching-yi; Chang, Tzyh-chyang; Lai, Yen-ju; Lee, Wen-shuan]|[ur.01016302552.33; ur.01055407645.74; ur.013451140015.70; ; ]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2007|4566||225-230|10.1007/978-3-540-73333-1_28|pub.1001908844|3;[Goldberg, Bluma; Brintnell, E.

Understanding the extent and causes of the digital divide is important because IT skills have become increasingly vital to individuals’ economic success. Although IT is widely available in both the United States and Japan, there are notable gender differences in its actual usage between the two countries. In the United States, the gender gap in IT use has narrowed over time, and according to some measures, women are at least as likely as men to use computers. In Japan, however, sizable gender gaps in IT use persist. The contrasting patterns of IT use in the United States and Japan reflect differences in the structure of social organizations and institutions in the two countries. Studying gender differences in IT use across countries thus requires a nuanced understanding of the institutional context under which gender inequality is generated. Using the United States and Japan as contrasting examples, this article examines how gender differences in IT use evolve from gender inequality in broader cultural settings, particularly labor market institutions.",Encyclopedia of Gender and Information Technology,2006,,,564-569,"Trauth, Eileen M.; Ono, Hiroshi; Zavodny, Madeline",Stockholm School of Economics; Agnes Scott College,Sweden; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001132780,0,

This project is a joint venture between the E-Community Research Center, National University of Malaysia, and a government agency, as an effort to bridge digital divide in Malaysia. Children have been identified as one of the marginalized groups due to their economic status/power and also limited access to the Internet. Taking into account the fact that a great number of marginalized or underserved children in Malaysia have very limited access to the Internet due to the imbalanced user/computer ratio at government agencies' initiated telecenters, this portal is designed with the primary objective of providing children with a quick access channel or contact access point (CAP) to a myriad of services such as education and entertainment available on the net. In other words, this portal is planned in such a way to give more children the opportunity to access the Internet within the limited time they can afford and the limited facility available. The discussion will include the challenges and lessons learned at the different stages involved such as the planning stage, the design stage as well as the testing stage.",2009 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology,2009,,,449-453,"Bin Aziz, Jamaluddin",National University of Malaysia,Malaysia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094435405,0,

Despite large investments for developing the enabling infrastructure and the provision of access at affordable prices, however, demand for broadband has not increased the expected rate in many countries. The slow rate of broadband adoption can be viewed as being “supply constrained” in the developing world where countries are lagging behind in infrastructure development, but “demand constrained” in countries where high-speed access is already available to the majority of the population. In order to achieve greater uniformity in rates of adoption and use of broadband in both residential and small business contexts, and to reduce the digital divide, it is essential to focus upon understanding both macro- and micro-level factors influencing adoption and consequent use of broadband. The overall aim of this panel is to stimulate discussion and contribute to an understanding of the diffusion of broadband from a global perspective. In order to realise the overall aim, a number of studies from a range of different countries (including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and United Kingdom) are integrated within the panel discussion.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2007,235,,529-532,"Williams, Michael D.; Dwivedi, Yogesh Kumar; Middleton, Catherine; Wilson, Diana; Falch, Morton; Schulz, Alex; Weerakkody, Vishanth; Papazafeiropoulou, Anastasia; Ramdani, Ben; Gholami, Roya",Swansea University; Ryerson University; Trinity College Dublin; Technical University of Denmark; De Montfort University; Universiti Brunei Darussalam; University of Manchester; Aston University,United Kingdom; Canada; Ireland; Denmark; United Kingdom; Brunei; United Kingdom; United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1017295158,4,

During 2003, a survey was distributed to convenience samples of faculty members and students from the Midwest of the U.S. and three Eastern European countries. The data reflects students’ and faculty members’ opinions about the state of technology, online communication, and instruction. The results confirm findings from the literature about the existence of a digital divide between developed and emerging nations. Although Eastern European respondents don’t benefit from the technology base of their American correspondents, their satisfaction and comfort with technology remains relatively strong. The digital divide may result from administrative rigidity; Eastern European students enjoy less access to computer labs, due to fewer and less flexible hours. Faculty members and administrators remain entrenched in “old” technologies such as e-mail, whereas Millennials expect newer communication tools and prefer synchronous ones. Considering the available technology, online assessment is employed relatively inconsistently.

This study examines how socio-technical factors (e.g. organizational climate and IT related issues) affect information sharing through their effects on perceived relative satisfaction with the new media (Email, Instant Messaging and Video Conferencing) in the government and non-government sectors of an emerging economy. The findings reveal a digital divide between the non government and the government sector.

The Austrian Ministry of Education has left it to schools to define their profiles and to decide about the amount of imparting informatics to their pupils who are aged between 10 and 14 years. This paper gives a short historical overview and some insight into the present dialectic process between autonomy and the upcoming issue of educational standards. A recently conducted evaluation project in Carinthia/Austria, which can be considered as representative for related current studies in Austria, is presented. Empirical research is important. It perfectly fits the ongoing shift from input orientation to output measuring. Whereas other traditional subjects as (foreign) languages or mathematics are based on solid, historically developed fundaments, the comparatively new field of informatics at schools is still looking for stable frameworks. Considering the newest developments, we can be optimistic to achieve a reasonable solution for improving informatics education at lower secondary schools in Austria. Hopefully the announced educational standards in informatics will help to decrease the digital divide among our pupils.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2006,4226,,189-198,"Micheuz, Peter",University of Klagenfurt,Austria,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016924201,3,"[Dorninger, Christian]|[]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2005|3422||65-69|10.1007/978-3-540-31958-0_8|pub.1012291716|4"

In the telecommunication domain, understanding the distinction between potential adopters and existing users is an important issue, as the use of information and communication technologies is associated with what has become known as the digital divide. This study attempts to develop a theoretical framework that identifies utilitarian and hedonic values as the key predictors of MDS acceptance and continuance. It also investigates the difference in the determinants between potential adopters and existing users. The proposed research model is empirically tested by using survey data collected from 120 potential adopters and 354 existing users. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) show that the proposed research model provides a significant explanation of the variance of adoption intention and continued usage intention toward MDS.

pub.1038210323,10.1007/0-387-34588-4_22,"Institutions, Community, and People: An Evaluation of a Longitudinal Digital Divide Experience","A community computing center was established in late 2001 in a city council high-rise apartment block in Wellington, New Zealand’s capital city. The center was one of five computing hubs (centers) of the Smart Newtown Project, established with economic and social inclusion objectives, in the lower socio-economic suburb of Newtown. The project aim was to reduce inequalities of access to information and communications technology (ICT). A partnership approach was adopted that included multiple stakeholders: city council employees and councillors, a communications trust, universities, staff of a computer corporation, and some apartment residents. After 4 years of operation, the center was closed and remains so at the time of writing. Using a theoretical framework that includes Warschauer’s (2003) model of ICT for social inclusion, the concept of social capital, and Oldenburg’s (1991) third place, this paper examines reasons for the center’s closure. The main findings reveal that low social capital and the inadequate support of social resources in the form of the community and an institution were key factors in the closure of this initiative. Recommendations are made for implementing future projects.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2006,208,,333-346,"Crump, Barbara J.",Massey University,New Zealand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038210323,0,"[Pigg, Kenneth E.]|[]|Information Communication & Society|2001|4|4|507-527|10.1080/13691180110096996|pub.1012838075|31;[McClenaghan, Pauline]|[ur.015036551651.52]|British Educational Research Journal|2000|26|5|565-582|10.1080/713651581|pub.1042194194|69;[Pinkett, Randal; O'Bryant, Richard]|[ur.015244301651.96; ]|Information Communication & Society|2003|6|2|187-210|10.1080/1369118032000093888|pub.1045522480|13;[Coleman, James S.]|[]|American Journal of Sociology|1988|94||s95-s120|10.1086/228943|pub.1058548441|17531;[Crump, Barbara; McIlroy, Andrea]|[; ]|First Monday|2003|8|12||10.5210/fm.v8i12.1106|pub.1072710820|22;[Lin, Nan]|[]||2001||||10.1017/cbo9780511815447|pub.1098731708|3527;[Pigg, Kenneth E.; Crank, Laura Duffy]|[ur.016003636061.49; ur.013751661514.53]|The Journal of Community Informatics|2004|1|1||10.15353/joci.v1i1.2062|pub.1133390053|75"

In particular, the chapter identifies five key tensions in this context: (i) the tension between the need for quick decisions and the need for analytical decision processes; (ii) the tension involving managerial need for action and the need for the safest execution of decisions that may be bold and risky; (iii) the tension around empowering middle managers and management teams at various organizational levels in the midst of powerful and impatient top executives; (iv) the tension between programmed, quick-action learning loops and the increased requirement for emergence and improvisation; and (v) the tension between expending effort to eliminate the digital divide with other organizations versus finding expedient ways to communicate through heterogeneous digital infrastructures. Each of the tensions, and how it can be managed, is illustrated through a case example. The chapter ends by suggesting that the management of these critical tensions needs to be fused into the day-to-day fabric of management practices for decision support processes.",International Handbooks on Information Systems,2008,,,3-17,"Carlsson, Sven A.; El Sawy, Omar A.",Lund University; University of Southern California,Sweden; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009689659,3,"[Eisenhardt, Kathleen M.]|[]|California Management Review|1990|32|3|39-54|10.2307/41166616|pub.1011989336|178;[Sawy, Omar A.

Design/methodology/approach The paper investigates the influence of ethnicity on the adoption and use of information and communications technologies in small and medium enterprises using a sample from the RC of a large southwestern metroplex.   Findings Results point to a continuing digital divide among Hispanic and non‐Hispanic SME owners. Non‐Hispanic SME owners were found to be much more likely to adopt a wider range of ICTs and to use them for both administrative and analytical purposes. Hispanic SME owners not only failed to adopt a full range of ICTs but also they were less likely to use ICTs for long‐term strategic analyses.   Originality/value The differences presented in this paper suggest that Hispanic SME owners may not be exploiting ICTs in order to achieve optimal operating efficiency and strategic effectiveness. The outcomes are particularly alarming because SMEs in RC areas have been the target of federal efforts to raise business productivity and profitability. The continuing digital divide may be undermining the very polices designed to enhance business operations in these relatively disadvantaged urban areas.,Management Research Review,2011,34,1,98-110,"Middleton, Karen L.; Byus, Kent",Texas A&M University – Corpus Christi,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041517397,13,"[Chaudhuri, Anindya; Flamm, Kenneth S.; Horrigan, John]|[ur.016531361071.37; ur.013543457071.02; ]|Telecommunications Policy|2005|29|9-10|731-755|10.1016/j.telpol.2005.07.001|pub.1027604222|129;[Thong, James Y.L.]|[ur.010227735415.39]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1999|15|4|187-214|10.1080/07421222.1999.11518227|pub.1027915017|855;[Kim, Yong‐Chan; Jung, Joo‐Young; Ball‐Rokeach, Sandra J.]|[ur.01007130304.06; ur.014617010016.37; ur.014002173501.16]|Information Technology and People|2007|20|3|282-303|10.1108/09593840710822877|pub.1044618901|39;[Flamm, Kenneth; Chaudhuri, Anindya]|[ur.013543457071.02; ur.016531361071.37]|Telecommunications Policy|2007|31|6-7|312-326|10.1016/j.telpol.2007.05.006|pub.1044727995|122;[Fairlie, Robert W.]|[ur.015575246157.36]|Electronic Commerce Research|2007|7|3-4|265-291|10.1007/s10660-007-9006-5|pub.1045832991|37;[Prieger, James E.; Hu, Wei-Min]|[ur.014605206564.75; ur.015647042476.65]|Information Economics and Policy|2008|20|2|150-167|10.1016/j.infoecopol.2008.01.001|pub.1048063804|139;[Ono, H.; Zavodny, M.]|[ur.01306451573.22; ur.01076707606.12]|Social Forces|2008|86|4|1455-1479|10.1353/sof.0.0052|pub.1065049155|75;[Stanton, Laura J.]|[]|37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004.

Many of these people live in rural, isolated and remote places of developing countries and are unlikely to be able to afford the cost of owning their own computers. However, NGOs, international aid agencies and governments are becoming increasingly aware of the potential that ICTs offer for rural development and poverty reduction and are creating more opportunities for providing wider access to them. This paper looks at how ICTs have contributed to the social development of a rural indigenous ethnic community. It focuses on the benefits of ICTs in recording and passing on their unique culture and traditions, something that is of considerable importance to the community. The research builds an understanding of the nature of cultural transmission within an indigenous community in East Malaysia and demonstrates how ICTs can bridge the digital divide by accentuating the importance of family, friends and other social interactions within a community in strengthening the processes of cultural transmission. Based on the findings, suggestions are offered for reinforcing social processes of cultural transmission with ICTs, in the form of a virtual museum and a community radio station.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2011,45,1,1-19,"Harris, Charlotte A.; Harris, Roger W.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099634516,13,"[*, Cameron Richards]|[]|Globalisation Societies and Education|2004|2|3|337-353|10.1080/1476772042000252470|pub.1026867997|41;[Madley, Benjamin]|[]|Journal of Genocide Research|2004|6|2|167-192|10.1080/1462352042000225930|pub.1027336645|41;[Abraham, Reuben]|[]|Information Technologies and International Development|2007|4|1|5-17|10.1162/itid.2007.4.1.5|pub.1063351793|157;[Dyson, Laurel Evelyn; Hendriks, Max; Grant, Stephen]|[]|Information Technology and Indigenous People|2007||||10.4018/978-1-59904-298-5|pub.1096031892|42;[Leaning, Marcus]|[]|The Journal of Community Informatics|2005|2|1||10.15353/joci.v2i1.2099|pub.1133392028|7"

It starts with statistics on access to ICT infrastructure in general as well as the actual location of Internet use and socio-economic profile of the users. These indicators relate to the Federal Government strategies to face the digital divide. Three main strategies guide the implementation of the digital inclusion public policy: home access, school and community access centers. Effort is made to supply equipments, connectivity, human resources and capacity building programs, monitored by constant evaluation and indicator building processes. Among many ongoing initiatives, the Computers for Inclusion project  (inspired by the Canadian Computers for Schools) and the National Digital Inclusion Observatory are explained in detail. The major challenges are then presented: broadband access in all regions; funds for the maintenance of existing infrastructure; local content production; qualified digital inclusion agents; participatory steering mechanisms for programs, community centers and schools; expanding the numbers of digital inclusion units; co-responsibility among Federal, State and Municipal levels. The conclusion ponders that while many results were achieved in implementing and measuring the strategies for bridging the digital divide, overcoming the stated challenges needs the effective involvement of Government in all its levels in partnership with society.",The Journal of Community Informatics,2007,3,3,,"Mori, Cristina Kiomi; Assumpção, Rodrigo Ortiz",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133391899,3,
pub.1094605949,10.1109/honet.2009.5423069,The Country Internet Registry (CIR) Model: An Alternative Approach for the Allocation and Distribution of IPv6 Addresses,"Internet has evolved from a research based closed network used by the scientist to a social network used by everyone. The way Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are allocated and distributed to users has also evolved with the Internet. But concerns have been raised that the present system of IP address management is not adequate with the growing demands of future Next Generation Network services, fair distribution of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) addresses, sovereignty rights, and bridging the digital divide. Voices have been made by some growing economies requesting for changes in the way currently IP addresses are managed especially with IPv6. This paper describes an alternative approach for the allocation and distribution of IPv6 Addresses by defining an expanded model called the Country Internet Registry (CIR) model. The proposed CIR model would serve in addition to the existing Regional Internet Registry (RIR) model and will coexist such that the users have a choice from whom they wish to obtain the IPv6 addresses. There would be a healthy competition between the CIR model and the RIR model leading to better services at a cheaper cost. The proposed CIR model would ensure that the allocation policies for IPv6 addresses provide equitable access to resources available on the Internet facilitating greater accessibility to the Internet by everyone, bridging the digital divide.",2009 6th International Symposium on High Capacity Optical Networks and Enabling Technologies (HONET),2009,,,216-220,"Murugesan, Raja Kumar; Ramadass, Sureswaran",Universiti Sains Malaysia,Malaysia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094605949,1,"[Wang, Mei]|[]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2005|3462||671-683|10.1007/11422778_54|pub.1018302338|5"

This study compares e-government adoption in the U.K. to adoption in the U.S. In particular, this study seeks to determine if the same factors are salient in both countries. Several studies have explored citizen acceptance of e-government services in the U.S. However, few studies have explored this phenomenon in the U.K. To identify the similarities and differences between the U.K. and the U.S. a survey is conducted in the U.K. and the findings are compared to the literature that investigates diffusion in the U.S. This study proposes a model of e-government adoption in the U.K. based on salient factors in the U.S. A survey is administered to 260 citizens in London to assess the importance of relative advantage, trust and the digital divide on intention to use e-government. The results of binary logistic regression indicate that there are cultural differences in e-government adoption in the U.K. and the U.S. The results indicate that of the prevailing adoption constructs, relative advantage and trust are pertinent in both the U.S. and the U.K., while ICT adoption barriers such as access and skill may vary by culture.

pub.1063750985,10.1177/0165551505050788,The global digital divide in the Internet: developed countries constructs and Third World realities,"Defined as the differential degree to which rich and poor countries benefit from new information and communications technologies such as the Internet, the global digital divide is widely measured by international institutions in terms of the number of persons with individual access to those technologies. Yet, while this measure makes sense in the rich countries, where individual ownership is widespread among the population, it makes very little sense in poor countries. For, in the latter, what we find is that although individual access is indeed very limited, a remarkable number of local innovations ensure that the benefits of the Internet are made available to at least 10 million people throughout the Third World. Many such persons are illiterate, unskilled and resident in the rural areas of developing countries. These findings directly contradict the commonly held notion that there are few, if any, local innovations in the applications of the Internet outside the rich countries and those parts of poorer countries with close connections to the former (most typically through multinational corporations).From a policy point of view, we suggest that foreign aid donors and national governments pay less attention to providing individual access facilities such as so-called telecentres and focus instead on ways to foster indigenous rural innovation systems devoted to finding relevant and cost-effective applications of the Internet.",Journal of Information Science,2005,31,2,114-123,"James, Jeffrey",Tilburg University,Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063750985,39,"[James, Jeffrey]|[ur.07532230071.92]|Journal of Information Technology|2004|19|3|172-177|10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000019|pub.1034378460|27"
pub.1030764820,10.4018/978-1-60566-699-0.ch030,Online Participation and Digital Divide,"This chapter examines whether government officials’ deployment of resources to broaden Internet access and participation is influenced by officials’ communication preferences and socioeconomic factors. The concern that the Internet explosion has alienated and marginalized some citizens from the democratic process and civic life has generated intellectual debate and led governments and other sectors to take measures to bridge the gap created by the digital divide. Although several studies have been conducted on the subject, few are yet to be done on the influence of government officials’ communication preferences and socioeconomic factors on resource deployment to broaden access and participation. Drawing on the theories of technological diffusion and determinism, as well as developmental and democratic theories, we argue that officials’ communication preferences and socioeconomic factors will be important in broadening Internet access and participation. Survey data, local government Web site contents and census data were analyzed. Results reveal that officials are not eager to commit resources to activities that broaden access and participation because they generally prefer to communicate with citizens via traditional channels. In addition, the sizes of the elderly and Black population, as well as the relative affluence of cities, do influence the presence of deliberative features on city Web sites.",Handbook of Research on Overcoming Digital Divides,2010,,,549-572,"Ferro, Enrico; Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Gil-Garcia, J.

We emphasise on the importance of the fight against the DD and we report a number of projects that aim to reduce it in Catalonia (Spain). The main contribution of this work is the study of the DD from the point of view of the relation between Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and disabled people. We analyse the problems that disabled people have to face in order to use ICTs. Therefore, we have defined a number of measures to determine the degree of accessibility that a given user has and we have carried out some experiments to evaluate the proposed measures. Our work is deeply related with the Òmnia Project and the telecentres network impelled by the Catalan Government. Thus, we must understand our work in the context of these innovative initiatives. In this chapter we concentrate on the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) issues related to the DD in order to explain our experience in this field.

The implications are wide and diversified. This includes the facilitation of trade transactions and acceleration of movement of capital through the new rules of the digital economy with the removal of time and distance barriers. The impacts are varying in density and effectiveness between developed and developing nations. Electronic commerce could be beneficial to business and socioeconomic development in the north (developed world) as well as in the south (developing nations). Small and medium-sized enterprises stand a unique opportunity worldwide to optimally leverage their capacities and excel from the diversified communication channels the digital economy presents. However, one challenge remains critical and that is the growing digital divide emerging between developed and developing nations as well as within developing nations themselves, which could deepen income and wealth inequalities. In that respect, the government role in developing nations in preventing the widening of the digital divide is becoming increasingly vital with implications that vary and affect business, culture and the society at large. During the past two decades, electronic commerce has had a diversified variety of impacts on organizations of all types and sizes. Such impacts differed from one country to another and from one environment to another, depending on the local conditions and the adaptation of the society. Implications related to the management and leadership of the organizations, their vision, mission and strategies, policies, governance, the organizational learning, ethics and culture among other elements. This chapter demonstrates the role of the government of Egypt in introducing, diffusing and institutionalizing electronic commerce. Electronic commerce represents a tremendous challenge and at the same time a great opportunity for growth and development, and hence it needs an institutional role to regulate it. Electronic commerce promises great potentials for developing nations giving poor nations and their populations additional access to markets, information, and other resources that would have otherwise been inaccessible. However, there has been a great fear of a digital divide emerging between developed and developing nations. Hence, the governments’ involvement of developing nations, such as Egypt, in preventing the appearance or the widening of the digital divide is of paramount importance. With respect to electronic commerce, the role of the government is highly different from its traditional role in other conventional areas that have been subject to extensive research, such as infrastructure and social services amongst others. It is different because electronic commerce is a newly ventured domain for government involvement that requires substantial thinking and structuring of the role it should play; it is more or less a comprehensive new role with aspects related to setting the rules for market operations as well as developing control measures to handle the risk factor associated with electronic commerce-related investments. Electronic commerce represents both a challenge and an opportunity for a developing nation such as Egypt with potentials for growth and development. This chapter introduces electronic commerce in Egypt with a focus on the prevailing status and the institutional role of the government to regulate electronic commerce and develop the electronic trading industry.",Electronic Government,2008,,,2376-2394,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Kamel, Sherif; Ghoneim, Ahmed; Ghoneim, Sherine",American University in Cairo; Cairo University,Egypt; Egypt,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026278860,1,

The wave of computerization of a medical community rolled in quickly. For the hospital which missed the wave, Digital divide is just a life-and-death problem. However, since the minor scale hospital is put on the severe situation by the influence of medical system reform, it is not easy unlike a large-scale hospital or a public hospital, to invest a large amount and to introduce medical information systems, such as electronic medical record system and HIS-RIS-PACS. However, the wave of computerization of a medical community cannot be bypassed and missing the wave means losing the struggle for existence between hospitals. In our hospital, the medical operating support system was built in the whole hospital in 2000 using the FileMaker Pro which is commercial database software, and it has contributed to improvement in the quality of medical examination, an improvement of medical efficiency, or improvement in the degree of patient satisfactory.

In an attempt to bridge the “digital divide” (between those who have access to information resources and those who do not), the three tier levels of government of Nigeria (Federal, State and Local Government) laid emphasis on rural electrification, thus promoting informative education through radio and television as well as licensing of GSM (Global Systems for Mobile Communication) operation. In Delta State of Nigeria, the wife of the Governor, Chief (Mrs.) N. Ibori initiated women centers. Also, she introduced an interactive 30minutes weekly programme on television for Ibo tomatoes producers. The Ibo communities are known to produce 70% of pluvial tomatoes (available from June to October in two out of six geographical zones of Nigeria). Recently, there has been an attempt to improve the production, distribution, preservation and sales of pluvial tomatoes in these communities through ICT. The introduction of ICT is with a view to replace the older form of ITs (Information Technologies), that is, town crier, smoke piper, drumming etc.This paper looks into the life style of Ibo community that promotes community – based ICT.

pub.1068645596,10.18489/sacj.v44i0.19,South Africa’s Socio-Techno divide: a critical discourse analysis of government speeches,"This paper aims at contributing to the debate about the digital divide. We first focus on what to us constitutes the root problem: the typical approaches to the development of people through and by the use of information and communication technologies (ICT). In contrast to governmental, political and technological attempts that focus almost exclusively on providing access to digital communication technologies, and expect “development” naturally to flow from that, we argue for a focus on “development” which is based on our notion of sustainable socio-economic development. We refer to “technocentric approaches” when the approaches propose and pursue technological interventions and show little regard for the actual needs of the people involved. At the other end of the scale, where the focus is on people and their developmental needs, we will speak of “sociocentric approaches”. This presents us with a different divide, which we will refer to as the “socio-techno divide”. We argue that it is this divide that has to be addressed – not the digital divide – and then present an analysis of the socio-techno divide. This analysis takes the form of two types of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), namely Foucauldian and Habermassian. The analysis of the South African government’s rhetoric illuminates the issues that need our attention and indicates an agenda for constructive engagement about the use of ICT for development in the Third and Fourth worlds.",South African Computer Journal,2010,44,0,,"Chigona, W; Pollock, M; Roode, JD",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1068645596,5,"[Chacko, James George]|[ur.014310554534.06]|Information Technology for Development|2005|11|1|97-99|10.1002/itdj.20005|pub.1019227664|21;[Grimes, Seamus]|[ur.014146041241.58]|Journal of Rural Studies|1992|8|3|269-278|10.1016/0743-0167(92)90004-p|pub.1023289803|34;[Cukier, Wendy; Bauer, Robert; Middleton, Catherine]|[ur.01067422552.86; ur.015324513401.37; ur.01112440712.45]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2004|143||233-258|10.1007/1-4020-8095-6_14|pub.1026823347|24"

This problem is particularly acute in developing countries, where most of the world's population lives. Bridging this digital divide, especially by attempting to increase the accessibility of broadband connectivity, can be challenging. The improvement of wide-area connectivity is constrained by factors such as how quickly we can dig ditches to bury fibers in the ground; and the cost of furnishing ""last-mile"" wiring can be prohibitively high.In this paper, we explore the use of digital storage media transported by the postal system as a general digital communication mechanism. While some companies have used the postal system to deliver software and movies, none of them has turned the postal system into a truly generic digital communication medium supporting a wide variety of applications. We call such a generic system a Postmanet . Compared to traditional wide-area connectivity options, the Postmanet has several important advantages, including wide global reach, great bandwidth potential and low cost.Manually preparing mobile storage devices for shipment may appear deceptively simple, but with many applications, communicating parties and messages, manual management becomes infeasible, and systems support at several levels becomes necessary. We explore the simultaneous exploitation of the Internet and the Postmanet, so we can combine their latency and bandwidth advantages to enable sophisticated bandwidth-intensive applications.",ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2004,34,4,159-166,"Wang, Randolph Y.; Sobti, Sumeet; Garg, Nitin; Ziskind, Elisha; Lai, Junwen; Krishnamurthy, Arvind",Princeton University; Yale University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063149265,10,"[von Eicken, Thorsten; Culler, David E.; Goldstein, Seth Copen; Schauser, Klaus Erik]|[ur.014302561203.81; ur.0734151530.99; ur.012132560303.73; ur.015614645242.40]|ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News|1992|20|2|256-266|10.1145/139669.140382|pub.1001760085|582;[Terry, D.

pub.1047703676,10.1145/1015467.1015485,Turning the postal system into a generic digital communication mechanism,"The phenomenon that rural residents and people with low incomes lag behind in Internet access is known as the ""digital divide."" This problem is particularly acute in developing countries, where most of the world's population lives. Bridging this digital divide, especially by attempting to increase the accessibility of broadband connectivity, can be challenging. The improvement of wide-area connectivity is constrained by factors such as how quickly we can dig ditches to bury fibers in the ground; and the cost of furnishing ""last-mile"" wiring can be prohibitively high.In this paper, we explore the use of digital storage media transported by the postal system as a general digital communication mechanism. While some companies have used the postal system to deliver software and movies, none of them has turned the postal system into a truly generic digital communication medium supporting a wide variety of applications. We call such a generic system a Postmanet. Compared to traditional wide-area connectivity options, the Postmanet has several important advantages, including wide global reach, great bandwidth potential and low cost.Manually preparing mobile storage devices for shipment may appear deceptively simple, but with many applications, communicating parties and messages, manual management becomes infeasible, and systems support at several levels becomes necessary. We explore the simultaneous exploitation of the Internet and the Postmanet, so we can combine their latency and bandwidth advantages to enable sophisticated bandwidth-intensive applications.",ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2004,34,4,159-166,"Wang, Randolph Y.; Sobti, Sumeet; Garg, Nitin; Ziskind, Elisha; Lai, Junwen; Krishnamurthy, Arvind",Princeton University; Yale University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047703676,25,"[von Eicken, Thorsten; Culler, David E.; Goldstein, Seth Copen; Schauser, Klaus Erik]|[ur.014302561203.81; ur.0734151530.99; ur.012132560303.73; ur.015614645242.40]|ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News|1992|20|2|256-266|10.1145/139669.140382|pub.1001760085|582;[Terry, D.

pub.1039302530,10.4018/978-1-59140-815-4.ch021,Computing in a New Zealand Urban Community,"Governments and international organisations have expressed concern regarding what has been labeled the digital divide, that is, the gap between those people who have access to, and the ability to use, modern information technologies—such as computers, the Internet, e-mail, and other mobile technologies, often referred to as information communication technologies (ICTs)—and those who do not. As a result a range of measures have been put in place by public agencies in an attempt to reduce the inequities between the “haves” and the “have nots”. One strategy which has commonly been used is the establishment of free and easy access to computing and Internet facilities within communities identified as needing such assistance. In Wellington, New Zealand, a project called Smart Newtown has been implemented whereby free public access to computers and the Internet and free introductory classes are made available to all citizens. The researchers were employed to evaluate the implementation and sustainability of this project and this chapter discusses how, over a period of three years, the participation of women has changed. The questions asked were “How did the women benefit from their attendance?” and “What caused this change in participation?” The article begins with a brief background on gender and ICTs, followed by a short review of the literature regarding the digital divide and community computing. One of the successful computing centers in the Smart Newtown project is then examined from a gender viewpoint.",Encyclopedia of Gender and Information Technology,2006,,,129-134,"Trauth, Eileen M.; Crump, Barbara J.; Logan, Keri; McIlroy, Andrea",Massey University,New Zealand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039302530,0,
pub.1064711330,10.1287/isre.1080.0194,Research Note—Social Interactions and the “Digital Divide”: Explaining Variations in Internet Use,"Given the increasingly important role of the Internet in education, healthcare, and other essential services, it is important that we develop an understanding of the “digital divide.” Despite the widespread diffusion of the Web and related technologies, pockets remain where the Internet is used sparingly, if at all. There are large geographic variations, as well as variations across ethnic and racial lines. Prior research suggests that individual, household, and regional differences are responsible for this disparity. We argue for an alternative explanation: Individual choice is subject to social influence (“peer effects”) that emanates from geographic proximity; this influence is the cause of the excess variation. We test this assertion with empirical analysis of a data set compiled from a number of sources. We find, first, that widespread Internet use among people who live in proximity has a direct effect on an individual's propensity to go online. Using data on residential segregation, we test the proposition that the Internet usage patterns of people who live in more ethnically isolated regions will more closely resemble usage patterns of their ethnic group. Finally, we examine the moderating impact of housing density and directly measured social interactions on the relationship between Internet use and peer effects. Results are consistent across analyses and provide strong evidence of peer effects, suggesting that individual Internet use is influenced by local patterns of usage. Implications for public policy and the diffusion of the Internet are discussed.",Information Systems Research,2009,20,2,277-294,"Agarwal, Ritu; Animesh, Animesh; Prasad, Kislaya","University of Maryland, College Park; McGill University",United States; Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1064711330,125,"[LOGES, WILLIAM E.; JUNG, JOO-YOUNG]|[ur.01001671405.59; ]|Communication Research|2001|28|4|536-562|10.1177/009365001028004007|pub.1000388613|234;[SCHMITZ, JOSEPH; FULK, JANET]|[ur.013276540131.85; ur.013307160407.53]|Communication Research|1991|18|4|487-523|10.1177/009365091018004003|pub.1001781530|386;[Dhavan V.

We report on part of a project that provided children families with computers and connection to the Internet. There is an increasing awareness that living in the 21st century involves using and interacting with a range of new technologies, also referred to as information and communications technologies (ICT). However, for many children and their families this is not possible because they do not have the capacity to purchase them. The Tech Packs Project (The Smith Family, 2007) grew out of the Computer for Every Child Project which was an attempt to start to bridge the ‘digital divide’ by providing computers so that a group of families in the targeted locations of large metropolitan cities could participate in the Information Age. The families involved were those whose personal resources did not afford them the opportunity to purchase new technologies, especially computers We surveyed the families members to determine the extent of their use of any technologies before and after receiving the computer and initiated focus groups to find out the ways in which having a computer created contexts for them to become more proficient in the use of ICT In this paper we will present the findings from both the survey and focus group data that we have collected.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2010,324,,440-446,"Yelland, Nicola; Neal, Greg; Dakich, Eva",Education University of Hong Kong; Victoria University,China; Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050264811,0,"[Warschauer, Mark]|[ur.01314712222.01]|Scientific American|2003|289|2|42-47|10.1038/scientificamerican0803-42|pub.1003766461|140;[Yelland, Nicola; Beris, Rebecca; Davidson, Kristy; Neal, Greg]|[ur.013663145052.04; ur.011223372727.04; ; ur.010070530461.32]|The International Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences Annual Review|2007|2|4|503-514|10.18848/1833-1882/cgp/v02i04/52385|pub.1068709216|1"

Despite many steps forward in social and economic conditions around the world in recent decades, there remain huge disparities in the quality of human existence. We are now at a critical juncture of time and place where unprecedented global flows in information, products, people, capital and ideas offer great potential for radical improvements in human development, but left unabated, they may also serve to worsen and entrench the spiral of poverty which already exists in many communities and countries limiting people to unleash the prowess of ICT revolution and creating a serious gap of information disparity called the Digital Divide. The digital divide means more than just a lack of computers and connections. Technology means nothing if it is not used where the people who could benefit the most are not using information technologies to address the problems they face, not only because they lack the training, but also because government policies often hinder affordable and accessible technology implementation.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2002,8,1,1-14,"Mujahid, Yousaf Haroon",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099624820,23,
pub.1049344979,10.4018/978-1-59904-939-7.ch098,Computing in a New Zealand Urban Community,"Governments and international organisations have expressed concern regarding what has been labeled the digital divide, that is, the gap between those people who have access to, and the ability to use, modern information technologies—such as computers, the Internet, e-mail, and other mobile technologies, often referred to as information communication technologies (ICTs)—and those who do not. As a result a range of measures have been put in place by public agencies in an attempt to reduce the inequities between the “haves” and the “have nots”. One strategy which has commonly been used is the establishment of free and easy access to computing and Internet facilities within communities identified as needing such assistance. In Wellington, New Zealand, a project called Smart Newtown has been implemented whereby free public access to computers and the Internet and free introductory classes are made available to all citizens. The researchers were employed to evaluate the implementation and sustainability of this project and this chapter discusses how, over a period of three years, the participation of women has changed. The questions asked were “How did the women benefit from their attendance?” and “What caused this change in participation?” The article begins with a brief background on gender and ICTs, followed by a short review of the literature regarding the digital divide and community computing. One of the successful computing centers in the Smart Newtown project is then examined from a gender viewpoint.",Global Information Technologies,2008,,,1348-1354,"Tan, Felix B.; Crump, Barbara J.; Logan, Keri; McIlroy, Andrea",Massey University,New Zealand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049344979,0,

We have designed the basic language application interface (LAPI) architecture to manipulate and manage conventional computer applications through language, devised a linguistic model of software functions and actions, and implemented a prototype to evaluate our ideas on software verbalization.",Journal of Advanced Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Informatics,2006,10,6,802-810,"Iwazume, Michiaki; Kobayashi, Ichiro; Sugeno, Michio",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1068818846,2,"[Takahashi, Yusuke; Kobayashi, Ichiro; Iwazume, Michiaki; Ito, Noriko; Sugeno, Michio]|[ur.014247141111.13; ur.07540432516.59; ur.013031263625.66; ur.016572053443.40; ur.012372322575.38]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2004|3230||103-114|10.1007/978-3-540-30228-5_10|pub.1009173271|4;[McTear, Michael F.]|[ur.010670440335.19]|ACM Computing Surveys|2002|34|1|90-169|10.1145/505282.505285|pub.1038056758|217;[Ito, Noriko; Sugimoto, Toru; Sugeno, Michio]|[ur.016572053443.40; ur.014577462157.18; ur.012372322575.38]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2004|2945||26-37|10.1007/978-3-540-24630-5_3|pub.1038364596|10;[Genesereth, Michael R.; Ketchpel, Steven P.]|[ur.010325306561.81; ur.010574126353.99]|Communications of the ACM|1994|37|7|48-ff.|10.1145/176789.176794|pub.1044882147|749;[Kobayashi, Ichiro; Sugimoto, Toru; Iwashita, Shino; Iwazume, Michiaki; Ozawa, Jun; Sugeno, Michio]|[ur.07540432516.59; ur.014577462157.18; ur.016547251377.06; ur.013031263625.66; ur.016164055377.07; ur.012372322575.38]|Journal of Advanced Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Informatics|2003|7|2|215-222|10.20965/jaciii.2003.p0215|pub.1068818538|3;[Sugimoto, Toru; Itc, Noriko; Iwashita, Shino; Sugeno, Michio]|[ur.014577462157.18; ; ur.016547251377.06; ur.012372322575.38]|2004 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (IEEE Cat.

To accomplish the goal, an integrated structural model was established. A questionnaire was developed and distributed to residents in rural areas in Korea. Of 302 responses collected, 272 were usable. PLS (Partial Least Squares) were used for analysis. Main effects and moderating effects were both investigated. Perceived usefulness for job and perceived playfulness turned out to be the strongest variables influencing personal IT use in the rural area. However, influence of interpersonal norm and social norm were not significant. Elder people having positive perception of IT use are less likely to leave for urban areas. More educated people tend to more optimistically evaluate the value of IT use; however, they are more likely to leave for urban areas. Lower income families tend to have less negative perception of IT use as their degree of IT use increases. The findings stress the importance of rural adult education and extension, as well as IT infrastructure construction.

For individuals who owned a home computer, gender, education, and labor force gaps in home Internet access had largely disappeared by 2002, although better educated males still most often used home e-mail. Male college graduates most often had work web access or email. Gender gaps in online time rose from 1995 to 2002; men and very well educated adults increased their hours the most. Occupational variables were critical: many gender differences in information technology (IT) access and use lessened when labor force participation or occupational type were controlled.

pub.1093197469,10.1109/hicss.2011.165,Different Paths to Broadband Access: The Impact of Governance and Policy on Broadband Diffusion in the Developed and Developing Worlds,"A new digital divide is emerging both within and between nations that is due to inequalities in broadband Internet access. Our research examines the broadband digital divide by analyzing the impact of administrative culture and policy initiatives in the form of strategic planning, execution, regulation and investment on broadband diffusion in 139 countries. Our multiple regression analysis shows that factors that determine broadband diffusion in technologically developed countries do not necessarily have the same impact in less developed countries. For example, competition in the telecommunications sector has a positive impact in nations where access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) is expanding, but does not make a significant difference where ICT access is widely available. We also show that when controlling for measures of economic, political, social and educational development, there is greater broadband diffusion in countries that have an administrative culture of sound governance and make a higher shared financial investment in information and communication technologies. These results hold in nations where access to ICTs is expanding, even though the presence of a national telecommunications regulatory authority has a negative impact on broadband diffusion in the same group of countries. Our results suggest that the path to widespread availability and use of broadband requires different strategies depending on a nation's level of technological development. Furthermore, assessing overall government performance in terms of governance and policy initiatives on this journey is more important than factors such as the presence or absence of a national regulatory authority.",2011 44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,2011,1,,1-10,"Yates, David J.; Gulati, Girish J. “Jeff”; Weiss, Joseph W.",Bentley University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093197469,15,"[Distaso, Walter; Lupi, Paolo; Manenti, Fabio M.]|[ur.014724466756.32; ur.011163534041.98; ur.016205366663.91]|Information Economics and Policy|2006|18|1|87-106|10.1016/j.infoecopol.2005.07.002|pub.1007753105|161;[Cava-Ferreruela, Inmaculada; Alabau-Muñoz, Antonio]|[; ]|Telecommunications Policy|2006|30|8-9|445-463|10.1016/j.telpol.2005.12.002|pub.1033740270|89;[Weaver, David H.; Buddenbaum, Judith M.; Fair, Jo Ellen]|[; ; ur.013063646017.83]|Journal of Communication|1985|35|2|104-117|10.1111/j.1460-2466.1985.tb02237.x|pub.1041164226|35;[Robison, Kristopher Kyle; Crenshaw, Edward M.]|[ur.015334225726.82; ur.013127613411.61]|Social Science Research|2002|31|3|334-363|10.1016/s0049-089x(02)00004-2|pub.1047972798|76;[Frieden, Rob]|[ur.015661425013.94]|Telecommunications Policy|2005|29|8|595-613|10.1016/j.telpol.2005.06.002|pub.1048398926|100;[Pick, James B.; Azari, Rasool]|[ur.013153730431.66; ur.016636325747.37]|Information Technology for Development|2008|14|2|91-115|10.1002/itdj.20095|pub.1051270561|91;[Chinn, M.

We in this community of ethnographic praxis, are privileged to move with some ease between corporate board rooms and people's living rooms around the world Yet, our messages and meanings that might lead to positive action are hampered by both our own language — that of development — and the ways in which people hear our language through specific cognitive heuristics and biases. In this paper, we specifically unpack the prevalent business interest concerning the “digital divide”. We discuss how that particular framing, i.e., digital, divide, essentializes upwards of 85–90% of the global population as simply poor and living in developing countries limiting business engagement. We argue that these predilections are further magnified by specific cognitive heuristics and biases we all posses but which are especially powerful amongst the business elite and which must be overcome to be effective. In response, we introduce an alternative scaffolding based on exchange rather than development, a view grounded in Simmel's simple and powerful notion of “exchange”. In the example of development, which we use in this paper, we argue to reposition ICT4D (ICT for Development) to ICT4X (ICT for Exchange). We suggest this repositioning reshapes the possible actions for business possibilities and opportunities, shifting the conversation from hand-outs to business ventures, an otherwise well understood construct.",Ethnographic Praxis in Industry Conference Proceedings,2007,2007,1,128-137,"SALVADOR, TONY; SHERRY, JOHN W.; AGATSTEIN, L.

pub.1094903779,10.1109/mws.2009.26,Hybrid Broadband Access with IEEE 802.16e,"Today broadband internet access is often regarded as an important and strategic factor for enterprises, private households, and for the medical and the educational sector. Besides increased quality of life and service, the broadband internet access has a strong economical impact for the selected region, e.g. on the inducement for settlement especially for enterprises. Unfortunately, still today there is a digital divide between urban and rural areas regarding a basic provision with broadband internet access. That means that today more than 75 million private households and enterprises do not have a satisfying access to modern internet-based applications. This digital divide is mainly caused in economic constraints, because the development and implementation of wired broadband networks especially in rural areas are very cost intensive and can often not be amortized in an acceptable period of time. Taking all this into account this work presents the main results of a project, which has been funded by the program PROFIL of the European Union. It focuses on the usage of IEEE 802.16e (also known as Mobile WiMAX) as a wireless enhancement in order to form hybrid broadband networks.

pub.1043176603,10.1108/07378830510586748,Bandwidth bottlenecks at the University of Botswana,"Purpose To examine the technical reasons for excessively slow internet speeds at the University of Botswana, to discover the present state of development efforts addressing such examples of the qualitative digital divide, and to recommend remedies.   Design/methodology/approach Surveys of students, the authors' professional experiences, and reports from corporate, public, and intergovernmental organizations provided insights into the effects – and causes – of internet slowdown.   Findings Bandwidth bottlenecks were identified in successive stages of intercontinental internet traffic. Causes included network design and capacity, telecommunications regulations, and competing budgetary demands within Botswana.   Research limitations/implications Much of the literature on the digital divide has stressed plentiful hardware and internet connections in affluent societies versus their scarcity in developing societies. This study illustrates that hardware and connections are necessary but not sufficient for adequate online performance. Technological advance and development can each stimulate the other, and that two‐way interconnection necessitates more than a simple call for more spending to increase developing countries' bandwidth. The paper presents recommendations in addition to higher funding.   Originality/value Student and other micro‐level data serve as measures for the local performance of a global utility, the internet. Tracking message transmission uncovers bottlenecks along the path of the intercontinental internet, specifically as it reaches Africa. These “street‐level” approaches can assist the international aid community, the telecommunications industry, and the public sector in Botswana and elsewhere in removing obstacles to the internet as a potentially important tool for national‐ and human‐development.",Library Hi Tech,2005,23,1,102-117,"Gerhan, David R.; Mutula, Stephen M.",Union College; University of Botswana,United States; Botswana,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043176603,16,"[]|[]|Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology|2004|242|2|189-190|10.1007/s00417-003-0855-x|pub.1002939353|36;[Mutula, Stephen M.; Wamukoya, Justus; Zulu, Saul F.]|[ur.013325104101.71; ur.011536337053.83; ur.011275465570.09]|Journal of Library Resource Sharing|2005|15|3|77-93|10.1300/j474v15n03_08|pub.1014457968|7;[Cullen, Rowena]|[ur.01027321712.95]|Online Information Review|2001|25|5|311-320|10.1108/14684520110410517|pub.1029188033|162;[Ngini, Chukwuma U.; Furnell, Steven M.; Ghita, Bogdan V.]|[; ur.012700541231.93; ur.014122440204.87]|Internet Research|2002|12|4|329-338|10.1108/10662240210438399|pub.1032002181|21;[Warschauer, Mark]|[]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|297-304|10.1080/01972240309490|pub.1051403945|133;[Afullo, Thomas J.]|[ur.015122203603.53]|Library Management|2000|21|4|205-214|10.1108/01435120010317507|pub.1052333825|23"
pub.1015692229,10.1080/01616841003779718,"The Internet, Public Libraries, and the Digital Divide","Virtually every public library in the United States provides public access Internet computers as a role central to its mission. This article addresses the issue of why the Internet matters for public libraries, both in terms of impacts on the general public, particularly the digitally disadvantaged (part one of the article) and impacts on libraries themselves (part two of the article). Each part of this report begins with an extensive literature review, followed by a data analysis section. In part one, the author uses the 2000 United States Census dataset to evaluate library efforts to bridge the digital divide, by analyzing differences in the growth of public terminals in library systems serving counties with different levels of household income, households in poverty, non-white households, and non-English-speaking households. The analysis finds no disparity in the number of public computers available in areas with high and low incomes but finds a significant—and widening—disparity in the number of computers available in areas with a higher versus lower percentage of non-white and non-English-speaking households. In part two of the report, the author uses a random effects linear regression model to estimate the effects of Internet access on library usage. This analysis finds that having Internet terminals (versus having no Internet terminals) has a significant positive effect on a library's visits and reference transactions, but not on a library's circulation. An increase in the number of Internet terminals has no significant effect, positive or negative, on visits, reference transactions, or circulation.",Public Library Quarterly,2010,29,2,104-161,"Kinney, Bo",Seattle Public Library,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015692229,43,"[Stevenson, Siobhan]|[]|The Information Society|2009|25|1|1-22|10.1080/01972240802587539|pub.1000580777|54;[Dhavan V.

pub.1016538435,10.1007/978-3-7908-2676-0_18,OECD Broadband Market Developments,"A recent Organization for Co-operation and Development (OECD) report to Ministers, concerning information and communications technology (ICT) and the digital economy, concluded that, “... considering the ongoing spread of ICT and its continued importance for growth, policy makers should foster an environment that helps firms seize the benefits of ICT” (OECD 2003a: 7). The deployment of highspeed (or broadband) Internet networks is integral for ICT diffusion generally, and in particular the availability broadband service.1 Broadband networks, as a general purpose technology, have the capability to deliver benefit to many economic sectors. That is, broadband networks can provide a vehicle to deliver, e.g., government, education, cultural and health services. Given the potential social dividend obtained from broadband technology use, it is important to ensure that this technology is widely diffused within nations—and not concentrated at the main, typically urban, national economic hubs. With broadband technology penetration increasing in urban areas, several OECD Member Country governments are addressing potential national broadband digital divide issues, viz., that national divides may develop should broadband service not be made readily available to rural and remotely located populations. Accordingly, this study provides an overview of broadband network developments within OECD Member Countries, and analyzes recent Member Country national broadband policy. Subsequent to this review, the potential for intra-Member Country national digital divides to emerge is considered, as are national initiatives to provide high-speed access to rural and remote populations. The chapter concludes with recommendations for policy makers.",Contributions to Economics,2004,,,303-313,"Ypsilanti, Dimitri; Paltridge, Sam",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016538435,0,[OECD]|[]||2003||||10.1787/232788646665|pub.1107155385|6
pub.1033460986,10.1016/j.giq.2008.11.002,Improving digital skills for the use of online public information and services,"There are recent indications regarding the use of online public services that force the government to focus on the more refined conceptualizations digital divide research has produced. This paper addresses one of the factors that appears to be important in several conceptualizations of how to approach the digital divide; the differential possession of so-called digital skills. The problem of being short of skills becomes urgent when governments suppose that citizens are able to complete about every task on the Internet. Operational definitions for operational, formal, information and strategic skills are used to measure the Internet skills of the Dutch population at large, by giving 109 subjects nine government related assignments to be accomplished on the Internet. Subjects were recruited following a two step approach; randomly select a sample from the book/list of fixed telephony subscribers, followed by drawing a selective quota sample for the strata of gender, age and educational level. The results indicate that on average 80% of the operational skill Internet tasks, 72% of formal Internet skills tasks, 62% of the information Internet skills tasks and 22% of strategic Internet skills tasks assigned have been successfully completed. The Dutch government's expectation that every citizen with an Internet connection is able to complete the assignments following tasks the government thinks every Internet user can perform, clearly is not justified. The article provides two types of policy recommendations to change this state of affairs. Recommendations for improving government websites and for improving the skill levels of Dutch citizens are suggested.",Government Information Quarterly,2009,26,2,333-340,"van Deursen, A.J.A.M.; van Dijk, J.A.G.M.",University of Twente,Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033460986,157,"[Bawden, David]|[]|Journal of Documentation|2001|57|2|218-259|10.1108/eum0000000007083|pub.1000197126|456;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2002|53|14|1239-1244|10.1002/asi.10166|pub.1003802830|109;[Talja, Sanna]|[ur.016536713323.74]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2004|56|1|13-22|10.1002/asi.20091|pub.1006101724|49;[van Deursen, Alexander; van Dijk, Jan; Ebbers, Wolfgang]|[ur.0771113123.24; ur.016570250333.33; ur.015724536245.61]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2006|4084||269-280|10.1007/11823100_24|pub.1007000482|47;[Ebbers, W.E.; Pieterson, W.J.; Noordman, H.N.]|[ur.015724536245.61; ur.012737250321.84; ]|Government Information Quarterly|2008|25|2|181-201|10.1016/j.giq.2006.11.003|pub.1007674442|143;[Jaeger, Paul T; Thompson, Kim M]|[ur.011542112017.14; ur.014776367265.07]|Government Information Quarterly|2003|20|4|389-394|10.1016/j.giq.2003.08.001|pub.1009664461|269;[van Dijk, Jan; Pieterson, Willem; van Deuren, Alexander; Ebbers, Wolfgang]|[ur.016570250333.33; ur.012737250321.84; ; ur.015724536245.61]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2007|4656||155-166|10.1007/978-3-540-74444-3_14|pub.1012539726|25;[van Dijk, Jan A.G.M.]|[ur.016570250333.33]|Poetics|2006|34|4-5|221-235|10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004|pub.1014130665|741;[Bertot, John Carlo]|[ur.011253735727.32]|Government Information Quarterly|2003|20|2|185-191|10.1016/s0740-624x(03)00036-4|pub.1027199920|96;[Jaeger, Paul T.]|[ur.011542112017.14]|Government Information Quarterly|2006|23|2|169-190|10.1016/j.giq.2006.03.002|pub.1028145630|111;[Freese, Jeremy; Rivas, Salvador; Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.0647703610.08; ; ur.014036273417.00]|Poetics|2006|34|4-5|236-249|10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.008|pub.1037704800|90;[van Deursen, Alexander]|[ur.0771113123.24]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2007|4656||143-154|10.1007/978-3-540-74444-3_13|pub.1038176369|11;[Pieterson, Willem; Ebbers, Wolfgang]|[ur.012737250321.84; ur.015724536245.61]|International Review of Administrative Sciences|2008|74|1|95-110|10.1177/0020852307085736|pub.1042945103|68;[van Dijk, Jan; Hacker, Kenneth]|[; ]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|315-326|10.1080/01972240309487|pub.1047421245|709;[Goulding, Anne]|[ur.010652214421.26]|Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|2001|33|3|109-111|10.1177/096100060103300301|pub.1053841707|53;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|First Monday|2002|7|4||10.5210/fm.v7i4.942|pub.1072710742|980;[]|[]|Choice|2003|41|03|41-1633-41-1633|10.5860/choice.41-1633|pub.1073390600|632;[van Dijk, Jan]|[]||2005||||10.4135/9781452229812|pub.1099350066|580;[]|[]|Issues in Information Systems|2005||||10.48009/1_iis_2005_289-295|pub.1133224447|27"
pub.1072164578,10.4038/sllim.v2i1.436,Trends of building and accessing digital collections and problems of digital divide in the emerging digital era,"The instant accessibility of information through the Internet and development of the World Wide Web have accelerated digitization work in libraries publishing houses and in enormous other organizations concerned with collecting, storing and communication of information. The paper depicts reasons for growing acceptability of digital collections and new kinds of challenges the digital media poses for the libraries and information centres. Portrays the growing unbundling of information in digital form and indicates the trends of development of new information products and knowledge management tools in the emerging digital environment. The growing digitization of information has created an information explosion to a level which the humanity has never witnessed before. In such a scenario cooperation, collaboration, synergy and convergence of work and efforts are the means to ensure accessibility of best possible information services to user communities. The growing volume of digitized information have bridged the information accessibility gap for some by providing access to enormous volume of information on desktop but it has created the problem of digital divide for those who have no access to information technology infrastructure or lack competencies to effectively use it. It suggests that a massive collaborative effort is required for imparting information literacy to people to build their capacities to derive adequate benefits from the digital revolution.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.4038/sllim.v2i1.436 Sri Lankan Journal of Librarianship and Information Management Volume 2, No.1 pp.5-10 The full text of this article is available on the NILIS website.",Sri Lankan Journal of Librarianship and Information Management,2009,2,1,5,"Malhan, IV",University of Jammu,India,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072164578,2,
pub.1094088049,10.1109/itsim.2008.4632011,Bridging Digital and Knowledge Divide via the Use of Wireless Technologies,The paper discusses the utilization of wireless technologies at telecentres in bridging the digital and knowledge divide whereby the research employed quantitative and qualitative research methods to 100 respondents in Perak and Terengganu. The findings are discussed with reference to the take up rate and adoption patterns of wireless technology. The quantitative analysis indicates high use of wireless technology and positive adoption patterns of wireless technologies at the telecentres. These findings are further discussed in terms of technology usage and applications and how the wireless technologies can be utilized at its maximum in bridging the digital divide.,2008 International Symposium on Information Technology,2008,3,,1-5,"Datin, Norizan; Abdul, Razak; Idrus, Mohd Muzhafar",National University of Malaysia,Malaysia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094088049,1,

Like other groups lost behind the so-called ""digital divide,"" this constituency lacks both access and experience in using electronic devices. Even the most technologically savvy members of this audience, which is composed primarily of adult and continuing education graduate students, would be considered novices who have only basic computing access. Helping such an audience understand the technology and delivering useful educational experiences to them presents a significant challenge. The paper reviews how basic, perhaps rudimentary, designs were established and how they changed to accommodate emerging problems.",18th Annual Conference on Computer Documentation. ipcc sigdoc 2000.

It also means that a person has the necessary ICT literacy skills needed to learn and succeed in an ICT-mediated learning environment. ICT literacy includes the ability to access, manage, integrate, evaluate, and create information. These skills are regulated by the appropriate cognitive styles, which allows an individual to acquire, process, store, retrieve and use information efficiently and effectively. Many adults lack these essential skills. This paper describes a model developed for bridging this cognitive divide based on brain plasticity research and cognitive augmentation and transfer training methodologies.",Proceedings 3rd IEEE International Conference on Advanced Technologies,2003,,,422-423,"Chinien, Chris; Boutin, France",University of Manitoba,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095421087,3,

pub.1010670540,10.1111/j.1435-5957.2005.00012.x,The regional cost gap of the Japanese local telecommunications service,Abstract.  The focus of the Japanese local telecommunications policy is shifting towards solving the problem of the digital divide that accompanies the spread of high-speed and broadband services. The article estimates a translog cost function of two outputs – the standard telephone service and the leased circuit service – and measures the regional gap of those stand-alone costs and incremental costs. The main point we make is that the cost gap for the leased circuit service is larger than that for the standard telephone service among the 11 Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) regional offices.,Papers of the Regional Science Association,2005,84,2,183-199,"Ida, Takanori; Asai, Sumiko",Kyoto University; Otsuma Women's University,Japan; Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010670540,2,"[Resende, Marcelo]|[ur.010647117317.17]|Information Economics and Policy|1999|11|1|23-44|10.1016/s0167-6245(98)00020-1|pub.1001012129|23;[Bohlin, Erik]|[ur.013334133323.32]|Telecommunications Policy|1997|21|2|79-84|10.1016/s0308-5961(97)83763-9|pub.1015822569|7;[Palmer, Karen]|[]|Economics Letters|1991|35|4|457-460|10.1016/0165-1765(91)90019-h|pub.1019336036|6;[Khaled, M.; Adams, M.

pub.1008874610,10.1016/s0740-8188(99)00017-1,Public Libraries and Networked Information Services in Low-Income Communities,"This article presents findings from an empirical study of community information exchange and computer access and use among low-income, predominantly African-American residents in one locale.

Design/methodology/approach A survey research method was used in the study to collect qualitative and quantitative data from actual and potential Telecentre users in relevant communities. The study was carried out through a survey. The primary sample comprised of 30 percent of the Telecentres. The secondary sample included users and potential users around the Telecentres. The total number of users and potential users was 338. The study was conducted from early January 2005 to the of end February 2006.   Findings The survey data disclosed that still only a small percentage of the total population are aware of Telecentres and use the facilities offered by them. The crucial factor affecting usage is language. According to the majority of respondents, as they understand only native languages they have not benefited from services such as like the internet and e‐mail. The content or the information that can be offered through Telecentres plays a pivotal role in this regard. Out of the 70 percent of rural population, the majority are not familiar with the English language. Therefore, Sinhala‐ and Tamil‐speaking people are disadvantaged. The survey data confirms that all Telecentres are highly (100 per cent) dependent on subsidies provided by ICTA. Hence, the sustainability of Telecentres is questionable at present.   Research limitations/implications The Telecentres situated in the North East region had to be excluded from the study due to the resumption of hostilities between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), and a corresponding lack of access and security in the region. The North East Province contains 9.84 per cent of Telecentres set up under the project.   Practical implications The findings of the study will help policy makers, decision makers and donors to properly address the key issues such as connectivity, accessibility, content and services, sustainability, skills development, partnerships with stakeholders and the needs of disadvantaged groups. Further, the problems and successes identified by the study will be useful for policy and decision makers to ensure the sustainability of the Telecentres and how the e‐Sri Lanka initiative and especially the 1,000 Telecentre project could be used to narrow the digital divide in Sri Lanka.   Originality/value This will be the first in‐depth study on the Telecentres, which are one of the major components of the government's e‐Sri Lanka initiative.

pub.1013370723,10.1145/1008213.1008223,The content digital divide,"Dear Editor-in-Chief, I would like to describe briefly how the non-profit kindersite project is utilizing digital media content in an innovative way to address social problems. Firstly to answer who we are; the two founders are Ziv Avidor, a technology specialist and consultant to government and corporations and Joel Josephson, an Internet strategist and high tech consultant. Our concept is to use content on a wide-scale over the Internet or within control groups to understand what constitutes effective and engaging digital content. This will be achieved through quantitative and qualitative research of users usage of the content. Our belief is that a bottom-up investigation will achieve focused and constructive results that will help raise the effectiveness and outcomes of content usage within the social causes targeted. Initially the team have implemented their ideas in two social projects involving education and the digital divide. The education project is targeted at gaining answers to the many and critical questions that surround the introduction of technology to early learners (ages 2 to 8) plus answering similar questions regarding the introduction of digital content for the teaching of English as a second language. This, more advanced project, is based around an Internet site http://www.kindersite.org that offers educators and parents of small children a free resource of 1,000s of links to content in the form of games, songs and stories. The content is being graded according to educational and appropriateness parameters. This project is currently being used globally with 152 officially participating schools in 27 countries plus registrations from about 80 countries. The second project utilizes an adaptation of the existing technology and focuses on the Content Digital Divide. This project will study how the effectiveness of introducing technology (computers and the Internet) to digitally divided communities can be improved. The project looks at the introduction to technology from a content perspective and will attempt to ensure that the recipients of the new technology are made fully aware from the first exposure, of the personal and community benefits of technology. The commissioning of content or adaptation will be completed on a local level with the additional purpose of stimulating growth in locally-based content providers. This proposal has gained the support of potential implementing partners in a number of developing countries including, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Nigeria, Cameroon, Kazakhstan, India etc. We are now looking to gain corporate and governmental support to help implement these projects on the scale we envisage and be very interested in the comments, sponsorship or practical help of your readership.

pub.1021682107,10.1108/eb045791,Towards bridging the digital divide for all‐round socio‐economic development in India of the 21st century,"The idea of connecting rural India to the world has captured the imagination of journalists, scholars, non‐governmental organizations, digital pioneers, and the corporate sectors. The revolution in information technology (IT) has transformed the world into a global society in a short time. To promote IT industry, the Indian Government established a Working Group on Information Technology for the Masses. If any technology can create new opportunities to bridge the gap between haves and have nots in society in the present times, it is IT says the background report of this Working Group on Information Technology for the Masses. In no country is the debate between the optimists and the pessimists more relevant than in India, where new centers of information technology are creating wealth and integrating some sectors into the global economy, while millions remain marginalized and deprived of the most basic human needs. On the other side of the digital divide are the 45 percent of the population who cannot read or write (57 percent of the female population), the 44 percent who survive on less than $1 per day, and those who live in the 370,000 villages that do not have telephone connections. Noting the irony of such sharp contrasts, the former President of India, Narayan lamented in a speech on the eve of the country's fiftieth anniversary as a republic that India has one of the world's largest reservoirs of trained technical personnel but also one of the world's largest number of illiterates, the largest number of people below the poverty line, and the largest number of children suffering from malnutrition. The fact remains that no developing country has benefited more from the digital revolution than India, and in no country is the digital divide wider or deeper. In the words of Bill Gates in which recently he pointed out, what good a computer is for someone who survives on 1$ per day, whose main concern is the next meal. It is a fact that in India the impact of information technology has not reached every sphere of activity or every individual yet India has made a good deal of contribution in this field and has risen to considerable eminence in the world. Information Technology has created a new and dynamic economic sector, generating significant employment and wealth. It is therefore necessary to see how we can bridge this divide that is shaping between the digitally rich and the digitally poor nations, institutions and individuals. The essential nature of the development process is the progressive development of social organizations and institutions that harness and direct the society's energies and material resources for higher levels of accomplishment.",Social Responsibility Journal,2005,Volume 1,Issue 1/2,21-23,"L.Buam, Deborah",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021682107,0,
pub.1025590220,10.1007/1-4020-8136-7_13,The Evolution of E-Inclusion,"The 1970s and 1980s saw a rapid take-up in the use of personal computers. During the same time period, society began to move towards providing equity for people with disabilities. As legislators around the world created new disability and Information Technology policies, more people with disabilities were given access to education and the evolving computing tools provided unprecedented educational opportunities. These opportunities were due to the use of new technologies such as outputting of electronic text to voice synthesizers. The provision of assistive technology was not only helpful; it also provided education through a medium that was previously unavailable, particular to the blind and vision impaired. For much of the 1980s the development of text-processing sensory technologies, connected to personal computers, led to a closer equality between the educational services of the able-bodied and people with disabilities.Unfortunately this evolution as not without notable difficulties: issues surrounding the cost of products, the lack of support from large corporations and choice of platform resulted in substantial difficulties for educators in the assessment of appropriate technology. In addition, many of these products became largely redundant in the late-1980s as corporations began to place more emphasis on the Graphical User Interface (GUI). Although the GUI was remarkably successful in allowing the general public to gain better access to personal computing, it’s non-text nature once again caused a digital divide for people with disabilities. Although it is clear that the evolution of the personal computer has had a significant impact on the provision of education for people with disabilities, this paper highlights the historical repetition where innovation is prioritized above e-inclusion.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2004,145,,123-131,"Hollier, Scott; Murray, Iain",Curtin University,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025590220,5,"[Levtzion‐Korach, O; Tennenbaum, A; Schnitzer, R; Ornoy, A]|[ur.01257737370.02; ur.01364532354.41; ; ur.074156016.49]|Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health|2000|36|3|226-229|10.1046/j.1440-1754.2000.00501.x|pub.1020975008|68;[Dorman, S M]|[ur.01003114607.24]|Journal of School Health|1998|68|3|120-123|10.1111/j.1746-1561.1998.tb03497.x|pub.1027257453|7;[Ross, G; Lipper, E G; Abramson, D; Preiser, L]|[ur.0614626164.75; ur.0662741364.70; ur.01356217050.20; ur.07667000237.85]|JAMA Pediatrics|2001|155|1|80-83|10.1001/archpedi.155.1.80|pub.1030888602|33;[Bricout, John C.]|[]|Journal of Social Work Education|2001|37|2|267-281|10.1080/10437797.2001.10779053|pub.1101357581|8"
pub.1053334221,10.1108/14779961011024819,The emancipatory role of information and communication technology,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of internet filtering, and its impact on marginalized groups including non‐governmental organizations, female activists, ethnic, and religious minorities, the younger generation and the increase of the digital divide in Iran.   Design/methodology/approach The paper raises two main questions: to what extent do information and communications technologies (ICTs) and in particular, the internet, promote freedom of speech, and gender equality in Iran? What is the impact of state censorship and ICT filtering on these activities? To answer these research questions, the author uses narratives of the internet's usage along with a comparison study with other Middle Eastern countries to analyze the impact of ICTs on citizen's freedom of expression.   Findings The paper argues that restrictions imposed on ICT tools and services by the Government of Iran which has been claimed to protect country's national security against the corruption and immorality imposed by Western countries not only affect the expansion of ICTs negatively but also civil liberties – thus increasing the digital divide internally, regionally, as well as on a global scale.   Research limitations/implications Albeit this research is limited to the case study of Iran, the author believes that lessens learned from the Iran's case study can be applied to other Islamic countries and in particular countries located in the Middle East region.

pub.1030330339,10.1017/cbo9780511498725.019,Distributive Justice and the Value of Information: A (Broadly) Rawlsian Approach,"INTRODUCTION Distributive justice in contemporary information societies concerns, among other issues, the distribution of information, information services, and information infrastructures. There is currently much enthusiasm about the potential of new information and communication technologies (ICTs), and the immense information resources contained on the World Wide Web, to improve the lives of those who have access to them. But at the same time, there is mounting concern over the uneven distribution of the new information wealth, both within nations and internationally. Some even fear that we may be heading for a regime of local and global ‘information-apartheid’ (Ratan 1995; Wresch 1996; Loader 1998; Schiller 1996), in which the ‘information-haves’ are segregated from the ‘information have-nots’. A host of empirical research adds force to such concerns. According to a 2005 UNCTAD study (UNCTAD 2006) the digital divide in the first years of the twenty-first century between nations is still wide. A person in a high-income country is more than twenty-two times more likely to be an Internet user than one in a low-income nation. In a high-income country, Internet affordability relative to income is more than150 times better than in a low-income nation. Even in lower-middle-income countries, the cost of twenty hours of inferior Internet service is nearly one-third the average monthly income. In high-income countries the cost of Internet service is affordable for most households, although the report claims that, even within these countries, considerable digital divides continue to exist between urban and rural areas, genders, age groups, and racial groups.",Information Technology and Moral Philosophy,2008,,,376-396,"Van Den Hoven, Jeroen; Rooksby, Emma",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030330339,18,"[Thomsen, Esteban]|[]||1992|2|||10.4324/9780203048542|pub.1031883499|44;[Buckland, Michael K.]|[ur.015053723765.67]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|1991|42|5|351-360|10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(199106)42:5<351::aid-asi5>3.0.co;2-3|pub.1033632398|591;[van den Hoven, J]|[ur.07356461527.79]|International Journal for Quality in Health Care|2000|12|1|5-6|10.1093/intqhc/12.1.5|pub.1040453403|4;[Loader, Brian D]|[]|Cyberspace Divide|1998||||10.4324/9780203169537|pub.1046224590|73;[Dowding, Keith]|[]|British Journal of Political Science|1992|22|3|301-314|10.1017/s0007123400006402|pub.1054775810|33;[Daniels, Norman]|[]|Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|1990|50||273|10.2307/2108044|pub.1069764886|51;[Sessions, William Lad]|[ur.010640024112.44]|Social Theory and Practice|1981|7|3|303-324|10.5840/soctheorpract19817315|pub.1073251080|4;[Sen, Amartya; Williams, Bernard]|[]|Utilitarianism and Beyond|1982||||10.1017/cbo9780511611964|pub.1109387080|616;[]|[]|A Theory of Justice, Revised Edition|1999||||10.4159/9780674042582|pub.1144910175|2493;[]|[]|A Theory of Justice|1971||||10.4159/9780674042605|pub.1145802668|7144"

The value of the information provided by a service such as Shopper.com depends on the size of the market, which is consistent with a variety of theories. When two firms list prices, consumers save 11% by purchasing at the lowest price rather than at the average price. These savings jump to 20% when more than 30 firms list prices. However, the potential savings accrue only to consumers on the “right” side of the digital divide.",Journal of Public Policy & Marketing,2003,22,1,17-25,"Baye, Michael R.; Morgan, John; Scholten, Patrick","Indiana University; University of California, Berkeley; Bentley University",United States; United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043533189,68,"[Resnick, Paul; Zeckhauser, Richard]|[ur.01132242673.62; ur.0775407467.49]|Advances in Applied Microeconomics|2002|11||127-157|10.1016/s0278-0984(02)11030-3|pub.1016311769|1037;[Shilony, Yuval]|[ur.014445621607.45]|Journal of Economic Theory|1977|14|2|373-388|10.1016/0022-0531(77)90137-5|pub.1020814864|154;[Baylis, Kathy; Perloff, Jeffrey M.]|[ur.0726312040.96; ur.01366126414.31]|Review of Industrial Organization|2002|21|3|305-324|10.1023/a:1020415304514|pub.1023777386|126;[Ward, Michael R.; Lee, Michael J.]|[; ]|Journal of Product & Brand Management|2000|9|1|6-20|10.1108/10610420010316302|pub.1025161401|190;[Baye, Michael R.; Morgan, John]|[ur.010300426541.38; ur.07435063542.67]|Economics Letters|2002|76|1|47-51|10.1016/s0165-1765(02)00028-9|pub.1031312013|32;[Scholten, Patrick; Smith, S.

Overall there is a negligible linear relationship but a pronounced curvilinear one between these variables, suggesting an optimal level of ICT use.

First it provides an overview of the traditional graphical user interface and the interaction difficulties which can arise for the elderly. Afterwards a definition of age and possible impacts of ageing on the access of information and communication technologies is given. In this context, the key factor for usage of technology is identified on the basis of two theoretical acceptance models. Then the paper describes the principles of TUIs, before showing by means of two examples the potentials of TUIs to improve the technology acceptance of older adults.",Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Computer Systems and Technologies - CompSysTech '11,2011,,,311-316,"Spreicer, Wolfgang",TU Wien,Austria,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026302564,27,"[Renaud, Karen; van Biljon, Judy]|[ur.014134660267.45; ur.011115305762.87]|Proceedings of the 2008 annual research conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists on IT research in developing countries riding the wave of technology - SAICSIT '08|2008|||210-219|10.1145/1456659.1456684|pub.1015776133|212;[van Dam, Andries]|[ur.012053754625.42]|Communications of the ACM|1997|40|2|63-67|10.1145/253671.253708|pub.1016389268|217;[Ishii, Hiroshi; Ullmer, Brygg]|[ur.015664645335.87; ur.07641337703.20]|Proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human factors in computing systems|1997|||234-241|10.1145/258549.258715|pub.1019864838|2220;[Ishii, Hiroshi]|[ur.015664645335.87]|Communications of the ACM|2008|51|6|32-36|10.1145/1349026.1349034|pub.1024418364|178;[Eisma, R.; Dickinson, A.; Goodman, J.; Syme, A.; Tiwari, L.; Newell, A.

The research is based on surveys of about 500 respondents in the two countries, supported by in-depth interviews.  The findings show that Internet cafés are used for competence development today, and that they have the potential to be suitable arenas for human resource development for a wide range of users.  For the users, access speed and price are important obstacles to increased use. More research is needed to see how Internet cafés can attract new user-groups to help reduce the digital divide within a developing country.",The Journal of Community Informatics,2007,3,2,,"Furuholt, Bjørn; Kristiansen, Stein",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133391924,11,

Traditional socio-demographic variables are apparent, and the influences of income and education seem to be particularly strong. The substantial variation observed in access price may largely have a spatial explanation. The analysis also suggests that the simple subscription decision is only modestly sensitive to price implying access subsidies for basic access are unlikely to be a highly effective tool in bridging the “digital divide”.",Telecommunications Policy,2005,29,9-10,731-755,"Chaudhuri, Anindya; Flamm, Kenneth S.; Horrigan, John",University of Colorado Boulder; Federal Communications Commission,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027604222,129,"[Gillett, Sharon Eisner]|[ur.014205054675.54]|The Information Society|2000|16|2|147-149|10.1080/01972240050032906|pub.1007433536|13;[Goldfarb, Avi]|[ur.0636245456.94]|International Journal of Industrial Organization|2006|24|2|203-225|10.1016/j.ijindorg.2005.11.004|pub.1009265685|42;[Kridel, Donald J.; Rappoport, Paul N.; Taylor, Lester D.]|[ur.014625526672.24; ur.07631342331.00; ur.011222220665.42]|Topics in Regulatory Economics and Policy|1999|||21-41|10.1007/978-1-4615-4643-6_3|pub.1022003746|21;[Berry, Steven; Levinsohn, James; Pakes, Ariel]|[ur.01261045077.08; ur.01335666214.61; ur.0750225604.91]|Econometrica|1995|63|4|841|10.2307/2171802|pub.1069804358|2669;[Gillett, Sharon E.; Lehr, William]|[; ur.016001202377.84]|SSRN Electronic Journal|1999||||10.2139/ssrn.3215923|pub.1106075404|12"

The study looks at various scenarios where broadband deployment is considered vital to achieve the nation's goals of bridging the digital divide. The current scenarios of broadband infrastructure were discussed. The technology choices that are available were compared and contrasted and its suitability is weighed in the context of the Malaysian scene. The study highlights how broadband may play a greater role in the provisioning of access services and positions wireless broadband as one of the possible solutions.,"VTC-2005-Fall. 2005 IEEE 62nd Vehicular Technology Conference, 2005.",2005,4,,2756-2760,"Tejinder, Singh; Sim, Moh Lim",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095431575,0,

Panel data at the household level for the period 1997–2001 and a dynamic random effects probit model are used for estimation purposes. We find that the probability of ownership is influenced by observed household characteristics (e.g., age, education, family composition, income and familiarity with technologically advanced durables), while genuine state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity constitute major sources of observed serial persistence. Furthermore, network effects seem to be at work. The results imply that the bridging of the digital divide between Greece and its E.U. partners is expected to follow a gradual long-term course.",Information Economics and Policy,2006,18,1,73-86,"Demoussis, Michael; Giannakopoulos, Nicholas",University of Patras,Greece,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047851912,10,"[Rosenberg, Nathan]|[]|Explorations in Economic History|1972|10|1|3-33|10.1016/0014-4983(72)90001-0|pub.1000470139|241;[Fairlie, Robert W]|[ur.015575246157.36]|Contributions in Economic Analysis & Policy|2004|3|1||10.2202/1538-0645.1263|pub.1001896093|143;[Strang, David; Soule, Sarah A.]|[ur.016473067345.56; ur.013775070771.33]|Annual Review of Sociology|1998|24|1|265-290|10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.265|pub.1002870279|950;[Hyslop, Dean R.]|[ur.012560470625.66]|Econometrica|1999|67|6|1255-1294|10.1111/1468-0262.00080|pub.1006746117|280;[Bosman, M.

This paper describes important directions for exploiting the proposed unified platform alleviating the digital divide that currently exists not only among countries but also within most regions of the same country.","2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications",2007,,,1-5,"Mastorakis, George; Markakis, Evangelos; Sideris, Anargyros; Pallis, Evangelos; Zacharopoulos, Vassilios",University of the Aegean; Centre for Technological Research of Crete,Greece; Greece,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095281644,7,"[Kouis, Dimitris; Loukatos, Dimitris; Kontovasilis, Kimon; Kormentzas, George; Skianis, Charalabos]|[ur.011242152251.38; ; ur.015713070763.18; ur.016342371332.32; ur.016030265777.32]|Computer Networks|2005|48|1|57-73|10.1016/j.comnet.2004.10.008|pub.1005642361|11;[Skianis, C.; Kormentzas, G.; Kontovasilis, K.]|[ur.016030265777.32; ur.016342371332.32; ur.015713070763.18]|Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing|2005|5|6|679-695|10.1002/wcm.334|pub.1026723829|19;[Pallis, Evangelos; Mantakas, Charalambos; Mastorakis, George; Kourtis, Anastasios; Zacharopoulos, Vassilios]|[ur.016344123075.91; ur.07523064365.69; ur.015557346701.99; ur.012616503623.96; ur.014115101142.22]|European Transactions on Telecommunications|2006|17|2|175-182|10.1002/ett.1099|pub.1052971685|18;[CALYAM, PRASAD; LEE, CHANG-GUN]|[ur.0612120307.38; ur.015313577023.88]|New Trends in Computer Networks|2005|||83-92|10.1142/9781860947308_0009|pub.1096050862|23"

The objective of this system is the production, integration, and synthesis of diverse views in a manner in which: a) all participants can come to respect and understand the differences caused by diverse values and interests of the contributing population, and b) there can be a movement towards consensus on at least some of the issues involved.

This paper discusses how the proliferation of the Internet has resulted in a cultural homogenisation via the lingua franca of the Internet, English. It then discusses the case of Latin American Internet portals to illustrate how local content provision on the Internet can be successful in attracting a local audience.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2009,37,1,1-12,"Andrade, Antonio Díaz; Urquhart, Cathy",University of Auckland,New Zealand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099629105,8,"[Webster, Professor Frank; Webster, Frank]|[; ]||1995||||10.4324/9780203426265|pub.1002852452|318;[Frances, Nic]|[]|Public Policy Research|2008|15|2|89-92|10.1111/j.1744-540x.2008.00518.x|pub.1008492784|9;[Singer, Jane B.]|[ur.07347514571.08]|Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly|2001|78|1|65-80|10.1177/107769900107800105|pub.1009336054|66;[]|[]|Business Horizons|1983|26|3|84-86|10.1016/0007-6813(83)90036-8|pub.1020591180|209;[Whitehand, J W R]|[ur.014151352413.47]|Area|2005|37|2|228-230|10.1111/j.1475-4762.2005.00625.x|pub.1038431252|25;[Holvast, Jan; Duquenoy, Penny; Whitehouse, Diane]|[ur.07645372361.37; ur.013430654761.88; ur.011076476113.41]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2005|179||135-152|10.1007/0-387-25588-5_10|pub.1045523746|6;[Main, Linda]|[]|Third World Quarterly|2001|22|1|83-97|10.1080/713701143|pub.1058424240|40;[Appadurai, Arjun]|[ur.015170674725.77]|Theory Culture & Society|1990|7|2-3|295-310|10.1177/026327690007002017|pub.1063785063|1930;[Clapp, Jennifer; Sen, Amartya]|[; ]|International Journal Canada's Journal of Global Policy Analysis|1999|55|1|160|10.2307/40203469|pub.1070533090|2263;[Barker, Chris]|[]|The SAGE Dictionary of Cultural Studies|2004||||10.4135/9781446221280.n53|pub.1087985444|88;[]|[]||2004||||10.4018/978-1-59140-168-1|pub.1096031183|21"

It argues that information and communication technology is creating new opportunities that can be seized to support human development and poverty-reduction strategies. However, it also clarifies that ICT on its own cannot leapfrog the old institutional and organizational weaknesses of Latin American economies and societies. The author hopes that understanding the deep-rooted inequalities that underlie ICT access in Latin America will not only inform researchers on the challenges for the development of the information society in the region, but also assist policy makers in the preparation and implementation of appropriate public policies.",Information Communication Technologies,2008,,,2566-2585,"Van Slyke, Craig; Cecchini, Simone",United Nations,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007673630,0,

Increasing access to ICTs to bridge the digital divide has implications for the information literacy needs of people in developing communities. The research described in this paper investigated development workers' perceptions of information literacy needs amongst local staff participating in community development projects in cross-cultural situations. A phenomenographic approach was used to elicit five hierarchically related, qualitatively different understandings of information literacy needs within the development context. The results reveal possible directions for those involved in bringing ICTs into workplace settings within developing communities.

pub.1019662258,10.1080/13602380601010573,Bridging the Digital Divide in Malaysia: An Empirical Analysis of Technological Transformation and Implications for E-development,"This article presents an empirical, multi-level analysis of the diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICTs) throughout Malaysia. It reflects on the potential for policy makers in developing countries to steer technological transformation towards ‘desirable’ ends and assesses the contribution of diverse parties and factors to the acceptance or otherwise of ICTs. The study finds that where policy makers ignore the multi-level, multi-actor processes by which technology and society co-evolve, opportunities may be missed to render the use of ICTs meaningful to would-be users.

Estimates indicate significant results for the supply–demand variables, and very strong results for the competition policy index.Simulations suggest that a generalized improvement in competition policy could lead to huge improvements in cell phone area coverage, and to an overall coverage increase of nearly 100%.",World Development,2009,37,9,1494-1505,"Buys, Piet; Dasgupta, Susmita; Thomas, Timothy S.; Wheeler, David",World Bank; Center for Global Development,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052731956,95,"[Barendse, Andrew]|[]|Telematics and Informatics|2004|21|1|49-66|10.1016/s0736-5853(03)00022-4|pub.1001011528|10;[Dasgupta, Susmita; Lall, Somik; Wheeler, David]|[ur.07725533447.34; ur.016411736217.36; ]|Oxford Development Studies|2005|33|2|229-243|10.1080/13600810500137889|pub.1002252553|85;[Varoudakis, Aristomene; Rossotto, Carlo Maria]|[ur.014251334655.29; ur.011233201633.07]|Telecommunications Policy|2004|28|1|59-78|10.1016/j.telpol.2003.06.002|pub.1002255063|26;[Mureithi, Muriuki]|[ur.016334754544.33]|Telecommunications Policy|2003|27|1-2|11-19|10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00096-4|pub.1002302661|7;[Baliamoune‐Lutz, Mina]|[ur.07704711743.28]|Information Technology for Development|2003|10|3|151-169|10.1002/itdj.1590100303|pub.1004608331|204;[Kibati, Mugo; Krairit, Donyaprueth]|[ur.012677502632.69; ur.01344166051.24]|Communications of the ACM|1999|42|6|60-66|10.1145/303849.303863|pub.1008307000|15;[Minges, Michael]|[ur.07747410547.96]|Telecommunications Policy|1999|23|7-8|585-593|10.1016/s0308-5961(99)00039-7|pub.1009514397|41;[Yan, Xu; Thong, James Y.L]|[ur.07426413441.91; ur.010227735415.39]|Telecommunications Policy|2003|27|3-4|301-315|10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00105-2|pub.1012447165|2;[Elbers, Chris; Lanjouw, Peter]|[ur.015560024044.39; ur.016555532273.62]|World Development|2001|29|3|481-496|10.1016/s0305-750x(00)00110-8|pub.1014029366|65;[Courtright, Christina]|[]|The Information Society|2004|20|5|345-356|10.1080/01972240490507983|pub.1015449003|19;[Ibarguen, Giancarlo]|[ur.015754651170.29]|Telecommunications Policy|2003|27|7|543-554|10.1016/s0308-5961(03)00050-8|pub.1018791240|18;[Brown, Irwin; Cajee, Zaheeda; Davies, Douglas; Stroebel, Shaun]|[ur.014326643121.34; ; ; ]|International Journal of Information Management|2003|23|5|381-394|10.1016/s0268-4012(03)00065-3|pub.1019262061|174;[Banerjee, Aniruddha; Ros, Agustin J.]|[ur.07602742127.76; ur.016306013327.18]|Telecommunications Policy|2004|28|2|107-132|10.1016/j.telpol.2003.12.001|pub.1025600515|51;[Bhuiyan, A.

pub.1045991518,10.1002/jid.869,Enterprise across the digital divide: information systems and rural microenterprise in Botswana,"This paper focuses on the role of information and information-handling technologies within the many rural microenterprises that currently lack access to ICTs. On the basis of field research in Botswana, it finds that poor rural entrepreneurs rely heavily on informal, social and local information systems. While highly appropriate in many ways, these systems can also be constrained and insular. Priorities for breaking this insularity will be greater access to shared telephone services. ICTs may play a supplementary role. They will need to be based in intermediary organizations that can provide complementary inputs of finance, skills, knowledge and other resources.

In the light of studies showing the existence of subcultures within a country, an experiment was designed and conducted based on the Hofstede cultural model and Tiwana’s expert knowledge model to determine how social differences affect the Internet usage of first-year university students. Data-mining techniques were then used to find relationships between culture and Internet usage. We conclude that abilities and performance relating to Internet use differs among subcultures not only because of the digital divide but also because of cultural differences.

pub.1028643785,10.1016/j.compedu.2003.08.006,Crossing the digital divide safely and trustingly: how ecologies of learning scaffold the journey,"The article addresses the issue of learning to elearn in borderless programs in a globalised learning landscape and the associated problems of scaffolding the journey across the digital divide. The authors argue that the assumption underlying such courses is that cross-cultural programs are viable because they are conceived and designed to be ‘global’, and that they assume this design to be inclusive. Henning and Van der Westhuizen claim that the global discourse in most domains can take only marginal note of the need to infuse such programs with a local semiotic—a course design criterion for which they argue. They furthermore forward the notion that the majority of the world's prospective elearners need various bridging mechanisms in order to be able to access the broader discourse and that one of these mechanisms can be explored through the metaphor of “information ecologies” as proposed by Nardi and O'Day [Nardi, B.A., & O'Day, V.L. (1999). Information ecologies. Using technology with heart. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press]. They also conclude that issues of the learners’ trust in the course and its system need to be considered when contemplating programs for diverse target groups. By way of a case study, consisting of three portraitures of adult learners, they explore the limitations of assumed distributed cognition and claim that learning is, in reality, contained/constrained in the familiar local narrative of the novice adult elearners in a rural South African context. The case study illustrates how the resistance to technology and its power base becomes an obstacle for the students and how the support of peers becomes the main scaffolding mechanism for their entry into electronic learning environments. The findings thus show how the social context becomes the facilitator and the scaffold for elearning, more than technology and the curriculum itself.",Computers & Education,2004,42,4,333-352,"Henning, Elizabeth; Van der Westhuizen, Duan",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028643785,14,"[Barab, Sasha A.; The ILF Design Team; Makinster, James G.; Moore, Julie A.; Cunningham, Donald J.]|[ur.01241475660.83; ; ur.0621624070.49; ; ur.0764246102.18]|Educational technology research and development|2001|49|4|71-96|10.1007/bf02504948|pub.1006325008|121;[Brown, John Seely; Collins, Allan; Duguid, Paul]|[ur.014430365055.10; ur.014012165741.82; ur.015536176017.71]|Educational Researcher|1989|18|1|32-42|10.3102/0013189x018001032|pub.1010595714|7294;[DUFF, PATRICIA A.; BELL, JILL SINCLAIR]|[ur.015352616625.07; ur.016557536753.82]|TESOL Quarterly|2002|36|2|207-213|10.2307/3588331|pub.1014982199|220;[PAVLENKO, ANETA]|[ur.012112315517.94]|TESOL Quarterly|2002|36|2|213-218|10.2307/3588332|pub.1017991779|100;[Henze, Rosemary C.; Glesne, Corrine; Peshkin, Alan; Berg, Bruce L.; Hammersley, Martyn; Atkinson, Paul]|[ur.010345207766.61; ur.011505700717.93; ; ; ; ]|TESOL Quarterly|1995|29|3|595-599|10.2307/3588079|pub.1019740199|356;[Giri, Ananta Kumar]|[ur.013374363167.17]|Futures|2002|34|1|103-115|10.1016/s0016-3287(01)00038-6|pub.1022553778|68;[Cottle, Thomas J.]|[ur.016036540366.54]|Qualitative Inquiry|2002|8|5|535-549|10.1177/107780002237003|pub.1024605160|15;[Lal, V]|[]|Futures|2002|34|1|1-14|10.1016/s0016-3287(01)00031-3|pub.1026497161|5;[]|[]|Computers & Mathematics with Applications|2003|45|10-11|1774|10.1016/s0898-1221(03)80128-1|pub.1033642258|78;[Resnick, Lauren B .]|[]|Perspectives on socially shared cognition.|1991|||1-20|10.1037/10096-018|pub.1039558333|278;[Oliver, R.; Omari, A.]|[ur.010137672217.40; ]|Journal of Computer Assisted Learning|2001|17|1|34-47|10.1111/j.1365-2729.2001.00157.x|pub.1042496375|54;[Henderson, Mae]|[]||1994||||10.4324/9781315865911|pub.1046761842|8;[Oliver, R.; Omari, A.]|[; ]|Journal of Computer Assisted Learning|2001|17|1|34-47|10.1046/j.1365-2729.2001.00157.x|pub.1056736505|60;[Seely, Brown; Seely Brown, John; Duguid, Paul]|[; ur.010413705027.36; ur.012006646027.65]|Work Study|2000|49|4||10.1108/ws.2000.07949dae.002|pub.1061082758|51;[Ellul, Jacques]|[]|Technology and Culture|1962|3|4|394|10.2307/3100993|pub.1070196918|345;[Bevington, Gary; Wolcott, Harry F.]|[; ur.013666247603.07]|Modern Language Journal|1996|80|3|405|10.2307/329455|pub.1070258749|354;[Nardi, Bonnie; O'Day, Vicki]|[ur.012361270012.98; ur.013342517701.95]|First Monday|1999|4|5||10.5210/fm.v4i5.669|pub.1072710489|118;[]|[]|Choice|1990|28|01|28-0612-28-0612|10.5860/choice.28-0612|pub.1073299619|2140;[]|[]|Choice|1991|28|11|28-6498-28-6498|10.5860/choice.28-6498|pub.1073305543|1325;[]|[]|Choice|1991|29|03|29-1793-29-1793|10.5860/choice.29-1793|pub.1073307389|49;[]|[]|Choice|1992|30|02|30-0885-30-0885|10.5860/choice.30-0885|pub.1073313114|144;[]|[]|Choice|1996|33|10|33-5756-33-5756|10.5860/choice.33-5756|pub.1073337521|271;[]|[]|Choice|1999|36|11|36-6416-36-6416|10.5860/choice.36-6416|pub.1073358761|191;[]|[]|Choice|2001|38|05|38-2855-38-2855|10.5860/choice.38-2855|pub.1073369704|65;[Riessman, Catherine Kohler]|[ur.0723015623.08]|Handbook of Interview Research|2001|||695-710|10.4135/9781412973588.n40|pub.1088079103|300;[Wengraf, Tom]|[]||2001||||10.4135/9781849209717|pub.1095899287|1229;[Phillips, Nelson; Hardy, Cynthia]|[; ]||2002||||10.4135/9781412983921|pub.1095899999|1097;[Lave, Jean; Wenger, Etienne]|[; ]||1991||||10.1017/cbo9780511815355|pub.1098698749|28352;[Lave, Jean]|[]||1988||||10.1017/cbo9780511609268|pub.1098708932|3580;[Chaiklin, Seth; Lave, Jean]|[]|Understanding Practice|1993||||10.1017/cbo9780511625510|pub.1109384170|372;[]|[]|Leonardo's Laptop|2003||||10.7551/mitpress/4201.001.0001|pub.1110620704|79;[Bruner, Jerome]|[]||1997||||10.2307/j.ctv136c601|pub.1128821421|309"

We focus here mostly on US cases. Deployment of wireless services to cities and towns has become a topic of considerable controversy. At the center of the debate is the decision by municipalities to offer low-cost service to citizens who would normally be excluded from the Internet. This ""digital divide"" justification often pits large cities against incumbent telecommunications providers. Legislation at the national and state levels has been somewhat favorable to the providers so far, but this bias might be shifting as more large providers join, rather than oppose, municipal wireless projects",IEEE Internet Computing,2006,10,3,66-71,"Gibbons, J.; Ruth, S.",George Mason University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1061403650,21,"[Goth, G.]|[ur.013105552111.51]|IEEE Internet Computing|2005|9|4|8-11|10.1109/mic.2005.78|pub.1061403584|2"

Many languages lack contextual proofreading tools; for many others, only partial solutions are available. Using existing, largely language-independent tools and collaborative processes it is possible to develop a practical style and grammar checker and to fight the digital divide in countries where commercial linguistic application software is unavailable or too expensive for average users. The described solution depends on relatively easily available language resources and does not require a fully formalized grammar nor a deep parser, yet it can detect many frequent context-dependent spelling mistakes, as well as grammatical, punctuation, usage, and stylistic errors.

It gives an account of the digital transformation taking place in the country and reviews a few digital library initiatives. It discusses a number of issues associated with the development of digital libraries with specific reference to Pakistan. The major issues appear are as follows: misconception about digital libraries; lack of technological applications; lack of human resources with needed skills; copyright and publishing; cultural divide; digital divide, and insufficient financial support. The authors believe that understanding the underlying issues will not only accelerate the development of DL in Pakistan, but also in other developing countries with more or less common environment.",Handbook of Research on Digital Libraries,2009,,,482-491,"Theng, Yin-Leng; Foo, Schubert; Goh, Dion; Na, Jin-Cheon; Ameen, Kanwal; Rafiq, Muhammad",University of the Punjab,Pakistan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1036863947,6,"[Ramzan, Muhammad]|[ur.015115011277.83]|The Electronic Library|2004|22|3|274-280|10.1108/02640470410541688|pub.1000846341|15;[Haider, Syed Jalaluddin]|[ur.014371244727.55]|Asian Libraries|1998|7|2|47-57|10.1108/10176749810368937|pub.1009576921|7;[Ameen, Kanwal; Haider, S.J.]|[ur.015651745521.62; ur.014371244727.55]|Collection Building|2007|26|2|54-58|10.1108/01604950710742086|pub.1017161597|6;[Theng, Yin-Leng; Foo, Schubert; Chen, Hsinchun; Zhou, Yilu]|[; ; ur.01320367405.07; ur.014065274177.64]|Design and Usability of Digital Libraries|2005|||1-21|10.4018/978-1-59140-441-5.ch001|pub.1036468348|3;[Mahmood, Khalid]|[ur.014707433500.07]|The Electronic Library|2003|21|2|99-109|10.1108/02640470310462434|pub.1043401377|26;[Haider, Syed Jalaluddin]|[ur.014371244727.55]|Information Development|2002|18|1|27-33|10.1177/0266666024241195|pub.1053768564|7;[Shafique, Farzana; Mahmood, Khalid]|[ur.011672164403.36; ur.014707433500.07]|Information Development|2008|24|1|66-78|10.1177/0266666907087698|pub.1063795923|21"

Our approach is to calculate several different cost-of-equity values and then use simulation techniques to build up a probability distribution for each company’s cost of equity. In this way, a clearer picture of where a company’s cost of equity lies is developed.

UK legislation advocates universal access and equitable provision of services, across all platforms and equipment, particularly for ‘vulnerable’ groups. However, key aspects of usability and accessibility have been overlooked by those responsible for encouraging this new infrastructure’s inclusive development. Aspects of previous interactive television provision and developments in web accessibility appear to have been ignored, along with findings from relevant user-centred research and even from specifically commissioned reports.

Our approach is to calculate several different cost-of-equity values and then use simulation techniques to build up a probability distribution for each company’s cost of equity. In this way, a clearer picture of where a company’s cost of equity lies is developed. Closing the Digital Divide could bring many benefits to developing countries but international investors and development planners must be able to make their own cost-of-equity calculations so that they can see first hand how their investment projects compare with other investment projects around the globe.",Digital Economy,2005,,,39-61,"Kehal, Harbhajan; Singh, Varinder; Henriques, Irene; Sadorsky, Perry",York University,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021743894,0,

Our empirical analysis shows that income, other demographics, and cost factors are important determinants of entry and availability. After controlling for other factors, the racial characteristics of the area do not affect DSL provision. Active competition in broadband from competitive LECs reduces deployment of DSL by the incumbent, but potential competition from competitive LECs has the opposite effect. Competition from cable companies also negatively influences the incumbent’s decision to supply DSL.

However, amidst waning concerns of a broadband digital divide, the geographic aspects of broadband availability continue to be intriguing. While some areas benefit from a robust selection of broadband providers, choices for consumers in other regions are often limited. The purpose of this paper is to explore the spatially unbalanced levels of broadband provision in the USA by providing an abbreviated longitudinal analysis of broadband regions and their development from 1999 to 2004.

It provides unique data on user behaviour in relation to electronic public service delivery through public access kiosks and highlights some of the issues relating to the ‘digital divide’, the reduction of social exclusion. It offers a perspective on the uses for which customers perceive public access kiosks to be valuable and indicates barriers to kiosk use for other functions. Some of the messages reflect issues that have been debated in consumer responses to e-commerce and communication over the Internet.

Many of healthcare systems developed so far are also offered as web service. However, user interface of web services that require web access makes obstacle to elderly or inexperienced users. As a mean to mitigate such digital divide, we developed a generic method of adding telephone interface to web service and implemented it to the self-care support system for life-style diseases. In our method, by making software PBX cooperate with web service, input/output to web service can be achieved by ordinary telephone device and users can talk with web service interactively.

Hybrid FiWi networks aim at providing wired and wireless quad-play services over the same infrastructure simultaneously and hold great promise to mitigate the digital divide and change the way we live and work by replacing commuting with teleworking. After overviewing enabling optical and wireless network technologies and their QoS provisioning techniques, we elaborate on enabling radio-over-fiber (RoF) and radio-and-fiber (R&F) technologies.

It will help to enlarge the coverage area of the government electronic public services and bridge the digital divide. In this paper, the author argues that the mechanisms of providing electronic public services for the information vulnerable groups mainly include two aspects, namely, providing mode and providing channels. In the aspect of providing mode, the paper suggests that the government should take the Public-Private Partnerships mode. In the aspect of providing channels, the paper advocates adopting various methods such as Internet, mobile phones, Government Call Centers (GCC) to spread government electronic public services to more information vulnerable groups.",Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance - ICEGOV '10,2010,,,295-300,"Wang, Shaohui",Wuhan University,China,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043013866,0,"[Ebbers, W.E.; Pieterson, W.J.; Noordman, H.N.]|[ur.015724536245.61; ur.012737250321.84; ]|Government Information Quarterly|2008|25|2|181-201|10.1016/j.giq.2006.11.003|pub.1007674442|143;[James, Jeffrey]|[ur.07532230071.92]|Telematics and Informatics|2009|26|4|317-321|10.1016/j.tele.2009.03.002|pub.1043898769|7;[Pieterson, Willem; Ebbers, Wolfgang; van Dijk, Jan]|[ur.012737250321.84; ur.015724536245.61; ur.016570250333.33]|Government Information Quarterly|2007|24|1|148-164|10.1016/j.giq.2005.12.001|pub.1044057969|58"

The usability of an eye-gaze input system was compared among three age groups (young, middle and elderly) and with that of a traditional mouse. The eye-gaze input system lead to the faster pointing time and improved the performance for elderly computer users. The advantage that the eye-gaze input system can compensate for the declined spatial ability and motor function of elderly users should be made the best use of by overcoming the problems such as the constrained head movement, the instability of cursor movement for elderly users, and the time consuming calibration procedure.","IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics",2002,2,,90-95,"Murata, Atsuo; Iwase, Hirokazu",Hiroshima City University; Kanagawa University,Japan; Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093348242,0,"[Jacob, Robert J.

Successful adoption of new technology, in particular mobile commerce, can serve as a catalyst for improving quality of life and reducing the digital divide. Adoption of new technology is dependent upon variables such as: organizational culture, business strategy, as well as their surrounding environment. Hypotheses that investigate the relationships between the above variables and business performance in the context of the new technology adoption process are formulated.

Using survey data, we find wide variations within the population. While some segments of African Americans are indeed less likely to perform certain activities on the internet, we note that certain segments of the African American population are reporting more internet activity than other racial groups. These ‘haves’ score high not just in comparison to their African American peers, but to the US American population as a whole. We suggest a move away from the digital divide/digital inequality models and a move towards thinking of greater or lesser Information and Communication Technology (ICT) usage as conditioned by the instrumental needs of population groups. We term this a digital practice model.",Future Internet,2011,3,3,185-203,"Graham, Roderick; Smith, Danielle Taana",Rhode Island College; Rochester Institute of Technology,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032594653,3,"[Grayson, J.

Answers on perceived barriers and on their evaluation are inevitably qualitative in nature and need to be used with caution in international comparisons. Nevertheless, they can be of great interest to policy makers. For example, indicators of barriers can help for monitoring issues of digital divide, point to potential bottlenecks related to the technology or lack of appropriate skills and help address concerns about security and logistics.",Measuring the Information Economy 2002,2003,,,37-57,OECD,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1088391754,0,

Its first and most obvious sign is the difference in the diffusion of broadband accesses. However, it is clear that there are also lines of separation in smaller geographic ranges: between countries of a same area, inside each country and, sometimes, in each specific region. This chapter shows this situation by studying the broadband access diffusion in Latin America on a three level basis (regional, national, and local). At the national level, a few explanatory variables of the different situations presented by the countries chosen for the study are researched. Additionally, a description of the environment (market and public action) where this diffusion is occurring is also included.",Handbook of Research on Global Diffusion of Broadband Data Transmission,2008,,,711-728,"Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Papazafeiropoulou, Anastasia; Choudrie, Jyoti; Rovalo, Arturo Robles; González, Claudio Feijóo; Gómez-Barroso, José Luis",National Autonomous University of Mexico; Technical University of Madrid; Joint Research Center; National University of Distance Education,Mexico; Spain; Spain; Spain,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049452406,1,

Besides having a low percentage of Internet users, the main issue lies with the digital divides among regions because of the high cost in utilizing IT and the lack of IT human resources. The Thai government realizes this problem, but the encouragement of IT use has just started. On the other hand, cooperation between universities in Thailand and Japan has been fostered and this will act as an important role in the development of IT human resources in Thailand.

Calls are made for social policy to address an apparent digital divide, for public policy to encourage technological innovation in the new information society, and for government service delivery which uses new technology to support improved individualised service. At the same time, concerns are raised about increased surveillance and invasions of privacy. The rhetoric of New Public Management also sees new technologies as a means to improve government service delivery through the use of performance indicators and market-like forms of operation. In what ways do these changes involve new forms of governing and the configuration of social relations?

Reassessments of their role due to technological development and widespread public use of the Internet are analysed. Central challenges of the digital society, including an increased digital divide and a weakening of local community identity, have resulted in lower social participation and involvement in community issues. Previous research has demonstrated that public libraries have a wide social impact on both individuals and local communities. This article focuses on the special characteristics of public libraries to assess their potentially enhanced role and value, as a public room and social and physical meeting place in the digitised age.

Indeed, as a strategy for helping developing countries to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), resources have been put aside to promote ICT. In 2002 the CEO Charter for Digital Development committed its signatories to give 20% of their annual corporate philanthropy budget to ICT projects in developing countries (United Nations 2002). In March 2005, the United Nations after years of deliberations launched a ‘Digital Solidarity Fund’ to finance projects that address ‘the uneven distribution and use’ of ICT and are aimed at enabling excluded people and countries to enter the new era of the information society (Economist 2005a).",Corporate Citizenship in Africa: Lessons from the Past; Paths to the Future,2006,,,201-210,"Muthuri, Judy N.; Mwaura, Kiarie",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047395581,1,

While successful development of 3G services will depend on the private sector, it will also be crucially influenced by the policy and regulatory environment, in particular by the facilitation of market entry through appropriate licensing policies, as well as post‐entry competitive conditions. This article reports on the findings of a workshop organized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) which identified critical policy issues with respect to the deployment of 3G mobile, including the regulatory status of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) and the facilitation of global roaming.

pub.1001908959,10.1002/nem.466,Toward the development of a standard e‐readiness assessment policy,"Information networking for digital integration is becoming of increasing importance for national and international organizations concerned with development. E-Readiness assessments, for various countries, are associated with the investigation of their state of readiness for such integration. They help in understanding the problems that need to be resolved in order to avoid digital divide, or even digital isolation, from world development. Such assessments lack standard policies, which provide unified measures that ease evaluations, support analysis and comparisons, and help in diagnosing problems and deriving solutions. This paper is concerned with the development of a standard e-readiness assessment policy. It provides a base for the development of such a policy, and hopes that this base will contribute to a future standard international policy.

pub.1003423499,10.1108/03074800610677308,Who says that old dogs cannot learn new tricks?,"In our modern society there is a prevailing belief that computers and the internet are mainly used by younger generations, who grew up with modern technology, and are generally all information literate. However, research shows that through the past ten years more and more older people have started to learn how to use computers and, of course, how to use the internet. The aim of this paper is to investigate and analyse internet usage among seniors on the basis of a case study showing the actual situation in Slovenia. A survey was carried out among seniors, the participants of different Third Age University programmes, by using a questionnaire, designed for this study. This particular group of seniors was chosen because they lead more active lifestyle than average seniors and the results should be more relevant. Participating in these programmes means they are eager to learn new things and that they have access to computers. It was found that among the seniors, Third Age University participants, only one third were active internet users. It was less than expected, as Slovenia has quite high internet usage among its citizens. Education and partly age were important factors in defining internet use. Public libraries can play a particularly important role in offering information literacy courses, offering space and others services to them, but this was not confirmed by the results of this study. The paper tried to establish the situation with a case study in Slovenia, a new EU member but also one of the European countries with the greatest use of internet and web. Digital divide, differences along the criteria of age, might be more important than elsewhere. Use of internet and web will become more and more wide‐spread and problems with social groups left out will be more visible and will have negative implications on equality of all citizens. Seniors as a social group are especially vulnerable and need help. Libraries can and must find new services with initiatives that promote the reduction of digital divide among age groups.",New Library World,2006,107,7/8,332-345,"Juznic, Primoz; Blazic, Maja; Mercun, Tanja; Plestenjak, Barbara; Majcenovic, Darko",University of Ljubljana; National and University Library of Slovenia,Slovenia; Slovenia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1003423499,25,"[Bawden, David]|[]|Journal of Documentation|2001|57|2|218-259|10.1108/eum0000000007083|pub.1000197126|456;[Klobas, Jane E.; Clyde, Laurel A.]|[ur.015472574537.43; ur.010233370347.00]|Library Management|2001|22|1/2|61-68|10.1108/01435120110358943|pub.1012207466|17;[Laurich, Rob]|[]|Collection Building|2002|21|4|174-182|10.1108/01604950210447421|pub.1012456234|6;[Wallis, Jake]|[ur.014072277107.36]|Library Review|2005|54|4|218-222|10.1108/00242530510593407|pub.1012752767|25;[Swindell, Richard; Thompson, Jean]|[; ]|Educational Gerontology|1995|21|5|429-447|10.1080/0360127950210505|pub.1031811960|108;[Vuori, Satu; Holmlund‐Rytkönen, Maria]|[; ur.015464466757.17]|Marketing Intelligence & Planning|2005|23|1|58-76|10.1108/02634500510577474|pub.1032451656|51;[Williams, Peter; Nicholas, Dave]|[ur.01233510277.60; ur.013242724300.13]|New Library World|1998|99|4|143-148|10.1108/03074809810217965|pub.1033246462|4;[Meischke, Hendrika; Eisenberg, Mickey; Rowe, Sharon; Cagle, Anthony]|[ur.01150046161.62; ur.014210767342.55; ur.01250731416.40; ur.01317044616.55]|Heart & Lung|2005|34|1|3-12|10.1016/j.hrtlng.2004.06.006|pub.1037902247|26;[Karavidas, Maria; Lim, Nicholas K.; Katsikas, Steve L.]|[; ; ]|Computers in Human Behavior|2005|21|5|697-711|10.1016/j.chb.2004.03.012|pub.1039989426|167;[Hubregtse, Sjaak]|[]|New Library World|2005|106|3/4|164-172|10.1108/03074800510587363|pub.1053626666|13;[Millward, Peter]|[ur.010411317705.13]|First Monday|2003|8|7||10.5210/fm.v8i7.1066|pub.1072710859|95"
pub.1004042169,10.1007/978-3-540-70924-4_9,Some Conjectures on the Tie Between Digital Divide and Regional Disparities,"In the mid-1980s there was much debate on the impact of information and communication technologies (ICTs) on productivity. The famous words of Robert Solow (1987) summarized the view of most skeptics: “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” In other words, according to Solow, there was no empirical evidence from the existing data that ICTs were generating productivity gains, but many firms were devoting considerable resources to ICT investment at the same time. This was known in the literature as the Solow paradox or productivity paradox. Many studies showed that ICTs contributed very little to productivity growth in the 1980s and in the early 1990s. Roach (1991) analyzed the productivity of white- and blue-collar workers between the mid-1970s and the mid-1980s. He showed that output per blue-collar worker grew by 16.9% between the mid-1970s and the mid-1980s, while output per white-collar worker, who mainly benefited from strong investment in ICTs, decreased by 6.6%. Loveman (1990) studied the impact of ICTs on the productivity of 60 business units estimating a production function by ordinary least squares. He showed that the contribution of ICT capital to output was approximately zero over the 5 year period studied in almost every subsample he examined. Barua, Kriebel and Mukhopadhyay (1991) found that there is a link between ICTs and intermediate indicators of productivity performance but not between ICTs and productivity. Morrison and Berndt (1990) using data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis found evidence that every dollar spent on ICT in the manufacturing sector, delivered only about $0.80 of value on the margin, indicating general over-investment in ICT.

pub.1099632249,10.1002/j.1681-4835.2002.tb00048.x,Rural Community ICT Applications: The Kothmale Model,"Spectacular growth in information and communication technologies (ICTs), and specifically the internet, has the potential to offer a new generation of tools for rural development. The internet, with its huge quantities and variety of content, is increasingly becoming an effective delivery and exchange system for information and knowledge, continuing education and learning. However, rural ICT requires special efforts to create appropriate models for those who can neither afford the Internet access nor have the language capacity to understand the content.[1] New information and communication technologies represent perhaps the greatest tool to date for self‐education and value‐addition to an individual or community's own efforts for development, yet poor rural communities do not have the necessary awareness, skills or facilities to contribute to their own development using ICTs. The majority and those with the least resources in South Asia are being left out of the benefits of these new technologies and more importantly, rural areas do even have a foothold in the revolution that ICTs are ushering in. Parallel to other increasing forms of inequity, there is an evident gap, widening at an exponential rate, between those with access to media and ICTs as productive tools and those without. Closing what has become known as ‘the digital divide’ is particularly important precisely because digital ICTs cut across and add value to all fields of development and offer applications to bridge the spectrum of inequities of which the ‘digital divide’ is only an extension or a symptom. The communication scenario along with the political context in the island nation of Sri Lanka is very much similar to most its South Asian neighbours. The metropolis and regional centres are witnessing rapid expansions in telecom and media sectors while telephones, electricity and clean drinking water are luxuries for many in the countryside. The absence of relevant experience is major barrier for rural ICT usage. One example that offers some useful insight and successful elements for a model is Kothmale Community Radio and Internet in central Sri Lanka.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2002,8,1,1-14,"Pringle, Ian; David, M.J.R.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099632249,22,
pub.1094164286,10.1109/icime.2010.5477534,The Dynamic Business Process Development Framework to Bridge the Digital Divide Among the Aboriginal Community In Australia,"The implementation of information systems in government organisations in Australia with specific reference to the aboriginal community is the major topic under study. This paper proposes a master plan entitled “Dynamic Business Process Development Network” showing the stakeholders and their inter-related activities. The proposed framework includes the development, training and maintenance of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and information systems for local communities especially for the Indigenous community. It also reviews the digital divide that exists between the Indigenous and nonindigenous sections of the population. Quite a few studies and reports have been published on this topic and the rationale of the study is due to lack of financial support, remoteness., education., and trained manpower in the Indigenous community. There are various recommendations from researchers and practitioners to address these shortcomings including community access centres., social inclusion., improving social capital and software packages that can provide custom solutions. However., unless more and more members of the Indigenous community have access to and use the Internet and ICT., the fundamental objective of the government's information systems implementation on communities will be lost. In order to bridge this gap the proposed framework attempts to enact as the integrated platform for the government organisations and other partners such as NGOs or public/private business sections to implement a dynamic business process model for social or community information development in the Indigenous community. The paper begins with the discussion of the importance of ICT in governance and its impact on the Indigenous community of Australia. It focuses on the gaps that exist with regard to its impact on the nonnative population in the country and its Indigenous population. A Dynamic Business Process Development Framework (DBPDF) is proposed to form the backbone of a system where effective implementation of ICT can benefit the Indigenous population of the nation. The paper concludes with a detailed delineation and the rationale behind the implementation of the DBPDF and recommendations for some future research directions.",2010 2nd IEEE International Conference on Information Management and Engineering,2010,,,76-83,"Mohammad, Mohammad; Lan, Yi-Chen",Western Sydney University,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094164286,1,"[Anderson, James G.; Aydin, Carolyn E.]|[]|Evaluating the Organizational Impact of Healthcare Information Systems|2005||||10.1007/0-387-30329-4|pub.1013617167|39;[Raval, Vasant]|[ur.016625344767.36]|Information & Management|1983|6|5|255-260|10.1016/0378-7206(83)90023-x|pub.1023920920|2;[Chatzoglou, Prodromos D.; Diamantidis, Anastasios D.]|[ur.016071707563.03; ur.012640446606.86]|International Journal of Information Management|2009|29|2|119-128|10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2008.04.008|pub.1030979088|18;[Meyer, N.

pub.1029639840,10.1016/j.telpol.2009.03.008,An index for cross-country analysis of ICT infrastructure and access,"The purpose of the present article is to devise an index for measuring and analyzing the divide among countries in the area of information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure and access. Understanding the fact that there are many factors influencing the digital divide, this research is not intended to measure the digital divide in terms of different inequalities, but it rather attempts to take only one of the most important of these factors (maybe the most important of them) into consideration for measuring and analyzing divide between countries, that is, ICT infrastructure and access. In contrast to the majority of the indices in this context, the proposed index is built upon defining and conceptualizing ICT infrastructure and access. In addition, the index uses core ICT indicators on which the international community and experienced modelers have consensus that they measure the information society suitably. Therefore, the index can be exploited as the basis and standard for internationally comparable statistics in ICT infrastructure and access area. Moreover, it is the second index based on core ICT indicators after the Digital Opportunity Index (DOI) that was developed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in 2005. However, in the current article, using Data Mining methods, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (to impute missing data) and Multi-Stage Factor Analysis (FA) (for aggregating the indicators), many problems and limits of the existing indices, the DOI in particular, such as the lack of data for analyzing ICT infrastructure and access, use of equal weighting or experts’ opinions to aggregate the indicators, are avoided. Since this index is developed by statistical procedures, it is flexible, adaptable, and modifiable over time while it sustains its original structure. It is comprised of two main dimensions: ‘ICT access’ and ‘coverage of mobile and access tariffs’ and 10 indicators.

pub.1094940409,10.1109/micc.2011.6150294,Issues affecting the use of information and communication technology among the elderly: A case study on JENii,"The diffusion of information and communication technology (ICT) for adoption among the elderly faces the issue of reluctant to adopt and use the technology. Unlike some of the other categories of users, individuals in this category show little interest to use ICT. Reasons for not using ICT among the elderly are fear of the technology, do not know how to use, do not need the computer, and cannot afford to buy computer and fee for Internet connection. As the elderly are perceived to be low ICT literate and fear to technology, their desire to use the technology need to be develop through provision of simple and easy to use technology. A simple gadget called Jendela Informasi Anda (literally translate as your window of information) or in short JENii was developed and introduced to this segment of the population as a strategic step to bridge the age digital divide. JENii contains easy applications and steps to teach the elderly on how to operate the gadget, how to access the content and how to overcome minor technical problems. This paper reports on the findings from the impact study on the use of JENii among the 26 pioneer users in Kota Kinabalu areas in East Malaysia. The focus of the discussion is on perception and experiences of users in using JENii. The study employed survey and focus group discussion. The findings indicate that the users' interest to use JENii depend on the knowledge to operate JENii i.e. to on and off, use the icons, and seek the information. Some users report that they don't use JENii often because they forget how to operate it and the content is not updated. Thus, the users feel frustrated and their motivation and interest level to use JENii will definitely decrease. The paper concludes that the introduction of JENii is a right step by the government to encourage wider usage of ICT and to address the issue of digital divide among the society, especially the marginalized group such as the adults and elderly.",2011 IEEE 10th Malaysia International Conference on Communications,2011,,,29-32,"Abdullah, Mohd Yusof; Salman, Ali; Razak, Norizan Abdul; Noor, Noor Fariza Mohd; Malek, Jalaluddin Abdul",National University of Malaysia,Malaysia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094940409,4,"[Broos, Agnetha; Roe, Keith]|[ur.01200645422.06; ur.015545261353.74]|Poetics|2006|34|4-5|306-317|10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.002|pub.1021666896|61;[Acilar, Ali]|[]|Issues in Informing Science and Information Technology|2011|8||231-244|10.28945/1415|pub.1092398370|35"

It has been argued that in systems of this kind the emphasis should be on invisibility, usability, universality and usefulness. A set of heuristics was generated based on those for evaluating web and ubiquitous systems but tailored to the requirements of a learning appliance. These heuristics were used to evaluate IMMEDIATE (Integrating MulitMEdia in a DIstAnce learning and TEaching environment), a teaching system intended to address the digital divide in education by providing a specialised, easy-to-use, e-learning environment for the PC. The results indicated that whilst IMMEDIATE supports the appropriate functionality, some improvements can be made to enhance the learning experience.",Proceedings of the 9th ACM SIGCHI New Zealand Chapter's International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction Design Centered HCI - CHINZ '08,2008,,,31-38,"Kemp, Elizabeth A; Thompson, Ashleigh-Jane; Johnson, Russell S.",Massey University,New Zealand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050124820,9,"[Weiser, Mark]|[]|Scientific American|1991|265|3|94-104|10.1038/scientificamerican0991-94|pub.1002170344|5693;[Bork, Alfred; Gunnarsdottir, Sigrun]|[; ur.0611426330.04]|Innovations in Science Education and Technology|2001|12|||10.1007/978-94-010-0636-1|pub.1009390400|22;[Bellotti, Victoria; Back, Maribeth; Edwards, W.

The “remote line” issue is especially important because these lines were classified on the other side of the digital divide as the “have nots” of the high-speed Internet age. As this article demonstrates, the “capability” prediction was accurate, but rapid technological breakthroughs have reduced the cost of upgrading remote lines considerably.

Given the influence of the infostate framework on the shaping of policy, this could have serious negative consequences for international efforts.

The results show that technological embeddedness positively affects household computer adoption. In addition, the impact of technological embeddedness is positively moderated by household income, and this impact is particularly stronger on first‐time buyers than on repeat buyers.

pub.1113258172,10.34105/j.kmel.2010.02.008,The relevance of telehealth across the digital divide: The transfer of knowledge over distance,"This paper explores the concept of relevance as an explanatory factor to the diffusion of IT-use, or, in this paper particularly, the use of Telehealth. Relevance is the net value of performance expectancy and effort expectancy and contains both micro-relevance (i.e. here-and-now) and macro-relevance (i.e. actual goals). Following the case-study approach, two Telehealth situations were studied in Rwanda and The Netherlands. In the comparison, two more existing studies in Canada and Tanzania were included. The conclusion is that relevance is the explanatory factor, whereas particularly micro-relevance is crucial. Without the micro-relevant occasions that initiate use, there will be no use on longer term. In the cases studied the micro-relevance of knowledge-transfer was crucial. Furthermore distance determined Telehealth relevance. Practical conclusions to cases were drawn.",Knowledge Management & E-Learning An International Journal,2010,,,89-108,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113258172,0,

Connectivity is one aspect of the divide, albeit an important one. Availability and affordability remain important issues, but these depend on not only technology choices, but also business and regulatory models. While mobile phones have achieved spectacular growth in emerging regions, Internet access, especially broadband, lags far behind. A generalized model of costing broadband indicates that limited uplinking (interconnection) is a significant barrier to widespread and affordable connectivity, but last mile access also remains a challenge. In addition, policy distortions and regulations raise costs dramatically. Because of these, new technologies, business models, and regulations may be required to make connectivity available and affordable in emerging economies. These include advanced wireless technologies, greater fiber utilization, and open access networking",IEEE Communications Magazine,2007,45,1,96-103,"Tongia, Rahul",Carnegie Mellon University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1061394485,17,"[Tongia, Rahul]|[ur.07706115175.16]|Proceedings of the 15th international conference on World Wide Web  - WWW '06|2006|||991-992|10.1145/1135777.1135980|pub.1024850459|2;[Cabric, D.; O'Donnell, I.D.; Chen, M.S.-W.; Brodersen, R.W.]|[ur.013473407533.45; ur.013310452401.29; ur.012547430757.39; ur.012565322561.38]|IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine|2006|6|2|30-45|10.1109/mcas.2006.1648988|pub.1061389634|165;[Peha, J.M.]|[ur.0622757644.31]|IEEE Communications Magazine|2005|43|2|10-12|10.1109/mcom.2005.1391490|pub.1061393966|425"

From this point of view, this paper considers four digital skills that citizens need when using online public services. Measurements of these skills in the Netherlands indicate that on average 80% of the operational skill Internet assignments, 72% of formal Internet skills assignments, 62% of the information Internet skills assignments and 25% of strategic Internet skills assignments have been successfully completed. Performances are significantly different for people with high, medium and low level of education attained and in some cases for people with different age.

The paper reviews the nature and extent of the take‐up of these technologies by small firms, and the digital divides that have emerged. Models of e‐business adoption by SMEs are examined, the linear model being contrasted with the more realistic “PIT” model. Barriers to the adoption of e‐business technologies and techniques are discussed, together with factors that promote successful adoption, and the major role played by human capital. It is concluded that the take‐up of e‐business by SMEs needs to be seen as a means to an end and not an end in itself. Government preoccupation with the take‐up of the technology of e‐commerce needs to be tempered with a more realistic view of how small firms operate.",Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development,2004,11,3,280-289,"Taylor, Michael; Murphy, Andrew",University of Birmingham,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1031902411,161,"[Thrift, Nigel]|[ur.010400170717.75]|Economy and Society|2001|30|4|412-432|10.1080/03085140120089045|pub.1001662296|177;[Perren, Lew]|[ur.012111227642.74]|Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development|2000|7|1|58-68|10.1108/eum0000000006805|pub.1010731513|29;[Ardichvili, Alexander; Cardozo, Richard; Ray, Sourav]|[ur.012311703125.49; ur.016326226205.26; ]|Journal of Business Venturing|2003|18|1|105-123|10.1016/s0883-9026(01)00068-4|pub.1011007289|1442;[Corso, Mariano; Martini, Antonella; Paolucci, Emilio; Pellegrini, Luisa]|[ur.013713623025.92; ur.011747232205.46; ur.016436711133.95; ur.015546305227.26]|Enterprise and Innovation Management Studies|2001|2|1|35-48|10.1080/14632440110056319|pub.1014961958|20;[Feindt, Sylvie; Jeffcoate, Judith; Chappell, Caroline]|[ur.011060263737.32; ur.014000052537.28; ur.016170374137.59]|Small Business Economics|2002|19|1|51-62|10.1023/a:1016165825476|pub.1015230356|90;[Martin, Lynn M.; Matlay, Harry]|[ur.015604335217.30; ur.013413567303.48]|Internet Research|2001|11|5|399-410|10.1108/eum0000000006118|pub.1016384670|173;[Southern, Alan; Tilley, Fiona]|[ur.07551535471.21; ]|New Technology Work and Employment|2000|15|2|138-154|10.1111/1468-005x.00070|pub.1021825477|73;[Burns, Paul; Harrison, Jean]|[; ]|Small Business|1996|||40-72|10.1007/978-1-349-24911-4_3|pub.1025268528|14;[Evans, Richard]|[]|Urban Studies|2002|39|5-6|947-975|10.1080/00420980220128390|pub.1032094797|11;[Taylor, Michael; Thrift, Nigel]|[; ur.010400170717.75]|Regional Studies|1983|17|6|445-465|10.1080/09595238300185441|pub.1058351424|82;[Dicken, Peter; Thrift, Nigel]|[; ur.010400170717.75]|Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|1992|17|3|279|10.2307/622880|pub.1070662860|199;[Rockart, J F]|[]|Harvard Business Review|1979|57|2|81-93||pub.1074433028|1318"

The analysis found that a broad range of demographic, geographic and economic factors significantly influence Internet use among children. Significantly, the availability of household computing resources and adult Internet users in the household were most important in explaining disparities in use among children. To expand universal Internet access, future public policy should focus on providing support for in-home access; continued support for public access at out-of-home locations such as schools, and providing technical support, training and expertise to school age children.",Universal Access in the Information Society,2005,4,4,354-373,"Cleary, Paul F.; Pierce, Glenn; Trauth, Eileen M.",Northeastern University; Pennsylvania State University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030209961,29,"[Mansell, Robin]|[ur.013665171232.89]|Current Sociology|2002|50|3|407-426|10.1177/0011392102050003007|pub.1004956599|130;[Soloway, Elliot; Norris, Cathie]|[ur.0641543214.24; ur.012376250415.78]|Communications of the ACM|1998|41|8|11-18|10.1145/280324.280325|pub.1006631923|5;[Blackman, Colin R]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1995|19|3|171-176|10.1016/0308-5961(94)00020-s|pub.1014815209|30;[Mueller, Milton]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1993|17|5|352-369|10.1016/0308-5961(93)90050-d|pub.1016041049|62;[Schement, Scott C.

The concepts of social capital and the digital divide intersect in access to public information technology. Social inclusion or exclusion occurs as a consequence of the ways in which societies are stratified according to race, gender, (dis)ability, ethnicity and class. This chapter focuses on one aspect of stratification, gender and theorizes the gendering of differential access and use of information technologies. An understanding of gendered participation relevant to access to public information technology within the policy contexts for electronic government and social inclusion is important to inform public information technology policy, and service planning and delivery that are premised on the notion of universal access.",Handbook of Research on Public Information Technology,2008,,,333-338,"Garson, G.

pub.1015741070,10.1002/jid.867,"ICTs in development—who benefits? Use of geographic information systems on the Cato Manor Development project, South Africa","The focus on the digital divide raises important questions with regards to the global impact of information technology. Technical inequalities are, however, often embedded in the development project where access to technological knowledge becomes a determining factor in the development process. This paper aims to uncover the use of geographic information systems (GIS) on the Cato Manor Development Project in Durban, South Africa. The focus will be on an instant where the legitimacy of the project was challenged by former residents, removed from the area during the Apartheid era, and the role of information technology in resolving that conflict. The paper will show that GIS is not necessarily a value-free tool, but can influence development decisions contrary to the expectations of those affected by it.

Three main categories of social and ethical issues arise in connection with IPv6: issues relating to the right to an IP address, issues related to the application of the technology, and issues related to governance. There are many societal benefits of IPv6, as it will enable once more to have end-to-end security of transmission. Nevertheless, the governance of this deployment now and in the coming years needs to be neutral and controlled, and the governance of the IPv6 Internet that emerges after deployment must be transparent and accountable. Any mistakes we make now will be very costly in terms of loss of existing personal freedoms.

With the concurrent rise in number of ICT projects in rural areas, the current situation calls for better design. However, it is our claim that the nature of villages.being devoid of digital artifacts.requires much of HCI theory and methodologies to be re-examined. HCI theory has evolved in urban environments over the past 30 years and may not be suitable for the village environment. However, Activity Theory lends itself well to these environments as its primary focus is on pre-existing activities and goals rather than digital artifacts themselves. Using this theory as basis, we examine past failures and successes of ICT interventions.

Some sites are geared primarily to non‐Native tourists and the general public, while others are designed to reach out to those tribal members who live far from Indian lands. Economic factors impact both the type of Web site the tribe can afford and the ability of tribal members to access the Internet. Tribal policies and cultural traditions determine what kind of information can be included. There are also a number of attributes that are common to most tribal Web sites.

The solutions must be affordable. Some of the major challenges in developing local solutions based on ICT are Bridging the Digital Divide, Trustworthiness, Protecting Intellectual Property, Information Assurance, Privacy, Hacking , Viruses and Worms. The solutions for these challenges are ‘People-Centric’ and are thus influenced by the “personal” and “professional” ethics of individuals. All the challenges cited above lead to many ethical issues. Internet being a global phenomenon the ethical issues need to be examined in Intercultural perspective.

In historical perspective, the Internet has diffused at a far faster rate than earlier generations of communications technology: from 1990 to early 2000, the estimated number of Internet users grew more than tenfold to roughly 300 million, affecting the way in which people communicate with each other, acquire information, learn, do business, and interact culturally. Our particular focus is on the opportunities e-commerce offers to small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries and the challenges they face in exploiting e-commerce’s potential.There is a risk that a “digital divide” will emerge, reinforcing existing income and wealth inequalities within and between countries.

This disparity is often called the “Digital Divide,” There has been plenty of talk and publications about this disparity, but little progress has been made. People underestimate the principle that services will be available in a market economy if they can be provided at a profit. The service providers in affluent regions thrive, simply because it's a profitable business. The paper defines a concept to transfer money from existing profitable operations to support sustained operations in less affluent areas to provide local interfaces. This is mainly done to stimulate profitable business for telecom operators in poor regions of the world. There is sufficient precedent for similar transfers, although not on an international basis, among domestic telecommunications operators in North America and elsewhere.",2007 First International Global Information Infrastructure Symposium,2007,,,1-5,"Walp, Robert; Ulema, Mehmet",Manhattan College,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094295292,0,

It offers an accessible and thoughtful survey of the transformations brought about by ICTs and their implications for the future of human life and society, for the evaluation of behaviour, and for the evolution of moral values and rights.

The authors seek to go beyond the familiar idea of the ‘digital divide’ to develop a focus on digital social inequality, through discussing three bodies of literature which are normally not discussed together. The paper thus addresses issues in feminist theory; the sociological field analysis of Pierre Bourdieu; and the Actor Network Theory. This paper shows that there are unexpected commonalities in these three perspectives which allow the possibility of effective cross-fertilization. All seek to avoid positing the existence of reified social groups which are held separate from technological forces, and all stress the role of fluid forms of relationality, from which social inequalities can emerge as forms of stabilization, accumulation and convertibility.",Information Communication & Society,2010,13,7,937-955,"Halford, Susan; Savage, Mike",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046991392,90,"[Law, John; Singleton, Vicky]|[; ]|Technology and Culture|2000|41|4|765-775|10.1353/tech.2000.0167|pub.1003798380|121;[Gilbert, Melissa R.; Masucci, Michele; Homko, Carol; Bove, Alfred A.]|[ur.014712417347.50; ur.01136747155.44; ur.01251717325.12; ur.01132445116.25]|Geoforum|2008|39|2|912-925|10.1016/j.geoforum.2007.08.001|pub.1013683976|42;[Faulkner, Wendy]|[ur.010617561231.16]|Women's Studies International Forum|2001|24|1|79-95|10.1016/s0277-5395(00)00166-7|pub.1014478690|245;[Bennett, Tony; Savage, Mike; Silva, Elizabeth Bortolaia; Warde, Alan; Gayo-Cal, Modesto; Wright, David]|[ur.011757230533.52; ur.01155035260.45; ; ur.01043553503.80; ur.010630537077.03; ]||2008||||10.4324/9780203930571|pub.1039576998|793;[Law, John]|[]|The Sociological Review|2008|56|4|623-649|10.1111/j.1467-954x.2008.00808.x|pub.1043429243|213;[Pinch, Trevor J.; Bijker, Wiebe E.]|[ur.013165351226.07; ur.013005151375.37]|Social Studies of Science|1984|14|3|399-441|10.1177/030631284014003004|pub.1045892922|1432;[Latour, Bruno]|[]|The Sociological Review|1990|38|1_suppl|103-131|10.1111/j.1467-954x.1990.tb03350.x|pub.1049458852|1095;[Campbell, Jan; Harbord, Janet]|[; ]|Theory Culture & Society|1999|16|2|229-239|10.1177/02632769922050494|pub.1052655099|10;[Coleman, James S.]|[]|American Journal of Sociology|1988|94||s95-s120|10.1086/228943|pub.1058548441|17531;[Burrows, Roger; Gane, Nicholas]|[ur.01273352061.20; ur.013620367275.23]|Sociology|2006|40|5|793-812|10.1177/0038038506067507|pub.1063687169|117;[Henwood, Flis]|[ur.011105725151.88]|European Journal of Women's Studies|2000|7|2|209-227|10.1177/135050680000700209|pub.1063983283|52;[]|[]|Choice|2003|41|03|41-1633-41-1633|10.5860/choice.41-1633|pub.1073390600|632;[Devine, Fiona]|[ur.011433217122.21]||2004||||10.1017/cbo9780511488771|pub.1098689578|219;[Putnam, Robert D.]|[]|Proceedings of the 2000 ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work  - CSCW '00|2000|||357|10.1145/358916.361990|pub.1098865239|10614;[]|[]|An Engine, Not a Camera|2006||||10.7551/mitpress/9780262134606.001.0001|pub.1099404641|1334"

The goal of this research is to examine the role of modernization (i.e., structural conduciveness) in the form of income, telephone price and structure, education, and political structures, and global contact in the form of world cities, trade, investment, activities of international nongovernmental organizations, and short-term exchanges of population in driving the worldwide diffusion of the Internet. Methods. We use longitudinal regression analyses (1995–2000) of change in Internet hosts for approximately 80 developing countries. Results. The analyses suggest that foreign investment, major urban agglomerations, manufacturing exports, nongovernmental organization presence, and tourism as well as democratic openness, property rights, and income predict Internet diffusion during the time period under investigation.

This article presents an analysis of local resident's engagement with their council's pilot project to develop a computer facility in their community center. We ask, to what extent can people in poor urban communities, once trained, be expected to volunteer to work on furthering community education and development in ICTs in their local area? Findings indicate four patterns of individual engagement with the computer project: reflexive, utilitarian, distributive, and nonparticipatory. It is argued that local people engaged with the intervention in historically patterned and locally distinctive ways that served immediate personal and pragmatic ends. They did not adopt the long-term strategic goals of the council or university.",The Information Society,2004,20,1,39-51,"Coco, Angela; Short, Patricia",University of Queensland,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1031656292,13,"[Howland, Joan Sidney]|[ur.016220307233.39]|The Electronic Library|1998|16|5|287-289|10.1108/eb045651|pub.1012000632|22;[Ann Locke Davidson, Janet Schofield]|[]|The Information Society|2001|17|1|21-32|10.1080/019722401750067405|pub.1013166921|18;[Sawicki, David S.; Craig, William J.]|[; ]|Journal of the American Planning Association|1996|62|4|512-523|10.1080/01944369608975715|pub.1043574580|83;[Editors, John Downing; Editors, Rob Fasano; Editors, Patricia A.

Cross-sectional data from the European Social Survey database were utilized and an ordered probit model with selectivity was employed. The hypothesized link between the decision to use the Internet and the extent of usage was confirmed by the data. Household income, cost of access, demographics, media use, regional characteristics and general skill acquisition by individuals appear to correlate with Internet use and the extent of usage. In addition, a non-linear decomposition analysis was applied in order to identify the causes of the observed south/north divide. The results indicate that the observed differences in the probability of Internet use constitute a structural problem.",Economics of Innovation and New Technology,2006,15,3,235-246,"Demoussis, Michael; Giannakopoulos, Nicholas",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027130931,71,"[Madden, Gary; Coble–Neal, Grant]|[ur.011425771741.73; ur.014775325515.94]|Economic Record|2002|78|242|343-357|10.1111/1475-4932.00062|pub.1001838930|8;[Kelly, Ross E.; Lewis, Philip E.

Studies on information systems serving rural communities have focused on a few sectors like agriculture, health or education. The paper touches upon the role of traditional media, developments in information and communication technologies (ICTs), the digital divide, and computerization at the rural level in various parts of the country. An experiment conducted by the National Institute of Rural Development, Hyderabad, on the use of IT to deliver information through the establishment of Public Information Kiosks (PIKs) is described in detail. Issues that were considered for humanizing the establishment of PIKs were identified. It is concluded that organizational linkages and networking capacities are to be strengthened for ‘digital unity’ to provide multiple opportunities to the rural communities to exploit local resources for their self-development.",The International Information & Library Review,2004,36,3,233-240,"Raju, K.A.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1020862277,2,"[Haque, M.

They have had a radical and widespread impact on our moral lives and hence on contemporary ethical debates. The Cambridge Handbook of Information and Computer Ethics, first published in 2010, provides an ambitious and authoritative introduction to the field, with discussions of a range of topics including privacy, ownership, freedom of speech, responsibility, technological determinism, the digital divide, cyber warfare, and online pornography. It offers an accessible and thoughtful survey of the transformations brought about by ICTs and their implications for the future of human life and society, for the evaluation of behaviour, and for the evolution of moral values and rights.

In the UK, policy and practitioner literature has stressed that for these centres to be successful they need to have strong social connections and be able to provide opportunities for interactive learning and content creation. Through a detailed analysis of one community e-gateway, which formed part of a wider study of public access provision, this article analyses the strengths and weaknesses of this advice drawing on broader sociological literature relating to social networks, network mapping and communities of practice.

Comparability of data across time and place, as well as compatibility of data with state administrative needs come at a cost of information loss about the setting and individuals that policymakers are trying to impact. We argue that the reconciliation of community and state logics and framings is critical for effective engagement with communities as well as formulation and implementation of development policies. We suggest several paths toward overcoming mismatched ontologies: education and communications strategies to enable communities and states to translate across ontologies and fill in significant gaps; re-assignment of policy responsibilities to minimize information loss; and several mechanisms that would enable communities to be directly and productively engaged in developing shared ontologies.",2009 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,2009,1,,1-10,"Wallack, Jessica Seddon; Srinivasan, Ramesh",IFMR Graduate School of Business; UtopiaCompression (United States),India; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094159680,2,"[Warschauer, Mark]|[ur.01314712222.01]|Scientific American|2003|289|2|42-47|10.1038/scientificamerican0803-42|pub.1003766461|140;[Olken, Benjamin A.]|[ur.013712746465.71]|Journal of Public Economics|2005|89|2-3|545-566|10.1016/j.jpubeco.2004.03.003|pub.1009010440|18;[Kanungo, Shivraj]|[ur.013617754123.52]|Information Technology and People|2004|17|4|407-422|10.1108/09593840410570267|pub.1010299913|58;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|Telecommunications Policy|1999|23|10-11|701-718|10.1016/s0308-5961(99)00050-6|pub.1014570506|228;[McKenzie, David J; Mookherjee, Dilip]|[; ]|Economía|2003|3|2|161-218|10.1353/eco.2003.0006|pub.1016562586|73;[Persson, Torsten]|[ur.012707462617.25]|Econometrica|2002|70|3|883-905|10.1111/1468-0262.00313|pub.1019558455|139;[Puri, S.

Interaction designs are discussed along with findings from various trials within the village and elsewhere. Our approach has been to develop prototypes that can work together in an integrated fashion so that content can flow freely and in interesting ways through the village.

Moreover, digital cities can succeed in simplifying citizen access to public information and services. Early digital cities deliver ‘smart’ and social services to citizens even with no digital skills, closing digital divide and establishing digital areas of trust in local communities.

pub.1039990005,10.1017/cbo9780511845239.012,Computer ethics and applied contexts,"Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have profoundly changed many aspects of life, including the nature of entertainment, work, communication, education, healthcare, industrial production and business, social relations and conflicts. They have had a radical and widespread impact on our moral lives and hence on contemporary ethical debates. The Cambridge Handbook of Information and Computer Ethics, first published in 2010, provides an ambitious and authoritative introduction to the field, with discussions of a range of topics including privacy, ownership, freedom of speech, responsibility, technological determinism, the digital divide, cyber warfare, and online pornography. It offers an accessible and thoughtful survey of the transformations brought about by ICTs and their implications for the future of human life and society, for the evaluation of behaviour, and for the evolution of moral values and rights. It will be a valuable book for all who are interested in the ethical aspects of the information society in which we live.",The Cambridge Handbook of Information and Computer Ethics,2010,,,181-198,"Weckert, John; Henschke, Adam",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039990005,1,

The model program is an outreach and technology diffusion initiative developed and maintained by the DCSS to encourage the use and awareness of information and communication technologies (ICTs) by underserved populations. A narrative assessment was generated using a qualitative approach based on researchers' direct observations of day-to-day operations, interviews conducted with key stakeholders, and review and analysis of official internal and external documents detailing program elements. The FTRC's successful efforts are tied to a combination of an environment ""suitable"" for change, the participation and ""buy-in"" of key stakeholders with a shared set of objectives, and the ability of key change agents both internally and externally to draw upon resources to ""leverage"" a digital divide policy initiative.",The Information Society,2003,19,4,305-314,"O'Neil, Dara V.; Baker, Paul M.

The role of information and communication technology in cross-country level and growth estimates,"The bulk of information and communication technology is made of weightless, implementable, and infinitely reproducible knowledge products (such as software and databases). These products are transferred by telephone lines, accessed through internet hosts, and processed through personal computers. In this work, the coefficient of the labour augmenting factor in the aggregate production function has been estimated using proxies of variables crucially affecting the diffusion of (non-rival and almost non-excludable) knowledge products. This specification provides interesting answers to some of the open issues in the existing growth literature. The most recent information, though available for a limited period, shows that telephone lines, personal computers, mobile phones, and internet hosts significantly affect levels and growth of income per worker across countries. The result is robust to changes in sample composition, econometric specification, and estimation approach.",Economics of Innovation and New Technology,2005,14,6,435-453,"Becchetti, Leonardo; Adriani†, Fabrizio",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019551689,28,"[Becchetti, L.; Bedoya, David andres londono; Paganetto, L.]|[ur.013310205666.92; ur.013222736077.22; ur.014072725067.00]|Journal of Productivity Analysis|2003|20|2|143-167|10.1023/a:1025128121853|pub.1004846652|63;[Leventhal, Naomi]|[]|Information Systems Management|1986|3|1|22-26|10.1080/07399018608965224|pub.1005903165|6;[Wößmann, Ludger]|[ur.010424766345.26]|Journal of Economic Surveys|2003|17|3|239-270|10.1111/1467-6419.00195|pub.1007785574|179;[Pagano, Marco]|[ur.014457673060.38]|European Economic Review|1993|37|2-3|613-622|10.1016/0014-2921(93)90051-b|pub.1011760199|813;[Efron, B.]|[]|The Annals of Statistics|1979|7|1||10.1214/aos/1176344552|pub.1012894299|11112;[Jorgenson, Dale W.; Ho, Mun S.; Stiroh, Kevin J.]|[ur.012327275705.42; ur.014517617305.26; ur.012362462064.30]|Technology, Growth, and the Labor Market|2003|||19-40|10.1007/978-1-4615-0325-5_3|pub.1013346352|46;[Evans, Paul]|[]|The Review of Economics and Statistics|1997|79|2|219-225|10.1162/003465397556809|pub.1017376450|116;[Erickson, Timothy]|[]|Econometrica|2001|69|1|221-222|10.1111/1468-0262.00185|pub.1019183170|11;[Efron, B.; Tibshirani, R.]|[; ]|Statistical Science|1986|1|1||10.1214/ss/1177013815|pub.1021018321|4510;[Bender, Donald H.]|[]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1986|3|2|22-32|10.1080/07421222.1986.11517760|pub.1022216278|119;[Oliner, Stephen D.; Sichel, Daniel E.]|[ur.012303224745.40; ur.012566361004.04]|Technology, Growth, and the Labor Market|2003|||41-94|10.1007/978-1-4615-0325-5_4|pub.1024881798|66;[Efron, B.; Stein, C.]|[; ]|The Annals of Statistics|1981|9|3||10.1214/aos/1176345462|pub.1026797736|917;[Antonelli, Cristiano]|[ur.016105373552.67]|Information Economics and Policy|2003|15|2|173-199|10.1016/s0167-6245(02)00093-8|pub.1030504131|63;[Jorgenson, Dale Weldeau; Stiroh, Kevin J.]|[ur.012327275705.42; ur.012362462064.30]|Brookings Papers on Economic Activity|2000|2000|1|125-210|10.1353/eca.2000.0008|pub.1031925788|771;[Rousseau, P.L.; Wachtel, P.]|[ur.011142431221.59; ur.014123036731.08]|Journal of Banking & Finance|2000|24|12|1933-1957|10.1016/s0378-4266(99)00123-5|pub.1040681421|385;[Perotti, Roberto]|[ur.012454507425.98]|Journal of Economic Growth|1996|1|2|149-187|10.1007/bf00138861|pub.1053705392|1109;[Barro, Robert J.]|[]|Journal of Political Economy|1992|100|2|223-251|10.1086/261816|pub.1058575297|3099;[Barro, R.

This paper examines a range of municipal Wi-Fi implementation models for potential impact on e-accessibility.

pub.1095503342,10.1109/cts.2008.4543925,Architecture for Extending Agrikiosk Services to Mobile Phones,"The recent advances in technology have enabled the use of electronic gadgets in every day life. The increase in use of mobile phones can be exploited to make them effective tools for e-learning and information dissemination. AgriKiosk project was initiated with an intention to use technology to abridge the digital divide and bring the benefits of technology to the doorsteps of the farmers. In the initial phase, the project was developed for the touch screen devices i.e. kiosk machines to deliver the agriculture information to the farmers in forms of audio, video and text in English and local languages. In this paper we present architecture to extend the AgriKiosk services to mobile phones and use this cheap and really easy to use technology to deliver the critical and needed information to the farmers.",2008 International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems,2008,,,144-148,"Akram, Attiya; Afzal, Muhammad; Zubairi, Junaid",Pir Mehr Ali Shah Arid Agriculture University; SUNY Fredonia,Pakistan; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095503342,2,"[Afzal, M.; Zubairi, J.; Akram, A.; Ahmad, S.; Kausar, S.]|[ur.012017531551.86; ur.013641734077.33; ur.016243631763.74; ; ]|2005 International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing|2005|||1-11|10.1109/colcom.2005.1651231|pub.1095068791|1"

As a solution to this problem, the concept of a novel “everyday language computing system” has already been proposed [1]. This is based on the revolutionary idea of people being able to access computer networks using the same ordinary language that we use in our everyday lives, a capability that would enable anyone-even the technologically inept—to use computers with the same easy familiarity that we use ordinary household appliances. In this paper we will demonstrate how this system could be flexibly adapted to various applications, propose an information communications model for operating/running such a computer system, and propose a scheme for operating/running computer software.","2004 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (IEEE Cat.

pub.1054061592,10.1177/0165551508092267,Health informatics: current issues and challenges,"Health informatics concerns the use of information and information and communication technologies within healthcare. Health informatics and information science need to take account of the unique aspects of health and medicine. The development of information systems and electronic records within health needs to consider the information needs and behaviour of all users. The sensitivity of personal health data raises ethical concerns for developing electronic records. E-health initiatives must actively involve users in the design, development, implementation and evaluation, and information science can contribute to understanding the needs and behaviour of user groups. Health informatics could make an important contribution to the ageing society and to reducing the digital divide and health divides within society. There is a need for an appropriate evidence base within health informatics to support future developments, and to ensure health informatics reaches its potential to improve the health and well-being of patients and the public.",Journal of Information Science,2008,34,4,501-518,"Bath, Peter A.",University of Sheffield,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1054061592,73,"[de Keizer, N.F.; Ammenwerth, E.]|[ur.01023316356.60; ur.0646754577.07]|International Journal of Medical Informatics|2007|77|1|41-49|10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2006.11.009|pub.1000244067|27;[Ma, Chunlan; Warren, Jim; Phillips, Patrick; Stanek, Jan]|[ur.0633345504.66; ur.01070563656.22; ; ur.0747574104.33]|International Journal of Medical Informatics|2005|75|8|577-596|10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2005.09.001|pub.1000772019|30;[Haux, Reinhold]|[ur.01131056237.07]|International Journal of Medical Informatics|2006|75|12|795-808|10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2006.05.045|pub.1001575352|45;[Chang, Betty L.; Bakken, Suzanne; Brown, S.

pub.1043510313,10.1016/j.telpol.2007.04.004,Closing the rural broadband gap: Promoting adoption of the Internet in rural America,"Even as geographic disparities in high speed Internet access narrow, an urban–rural broadband gap persists, pointing to the importance of individual differences in motivations to adopt broadband as the key to closing the gap. Diffusion of innovation is reconceptualized through contemporary perspectives of the digital divide and social cognitive theory and tested on a survey sample drawn from four rural communities. Path analysis was used to examine the factors that cause broadband Internet service adoption in rural communities. Prior experience with the Internet, the expected outcomes of broadband usage, direct personal experience with broadband, and self-efficacy had direct effects on broadband intentions. Age and income, but not education or ethnicity, also had direct impacts. Efforts that promote the personal benefits of broadband and advanced ICT literacy skills among Internet users are recommended.",Telecommunications Policy,2007,31,6-7,359-373,"LaRose, Robert; Gregg, Jennifer L.; Strover, Sharon; Straubhaar, Joseph; Carpenter, Serena",Michigan State University; University of Louisville; The University of Texas System,United States; United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043510313,158,"[Bentler, P M]|[ur.01273314037.58]|Psychological Bulletin|1990|107|2|238-246|10.1037/0033-2909.107.2.238|pub.1000641993|16795;[Eastin, Matthew S.; LaRose, Robert]|[ur.0737056724.32; ur.0634303551.63]|Computers in Human Behavior|2005|21|6|977-992|10.1016/j.chb.2004.02.024|pub.1003913174|87;[Foros, Øystein; Kind, Hans Jarle]|[ur.07426732137.44; ur.014256430737.23]|Journal of Regulatory Economics|2003|23|3|215-235|10.1023/a:1023408025917|pub.1012179837|21;[Kwak, Nojin; Skoric, Marko M.; Williams, Ann E.; Poor, Nathaniel D.]|[ur.011467505517.87; ur.016667535505.57; ur.07522700653.35; ur.016176736404.28]|Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media|2004|48|3|421-445|10.1207/s15506878jobem4803_5|pub.1012255808|21;[Bussey, Kay; Bandura, Albert]|[ur.013717643744.51; ur.01227557742.29]|Psychological Review|1999|106|4|676-713|10.1037/0033-295x.106.4.676|pub.1012280091|1230;[Venkatachalam, Shree; McDowell, Stephen D]|[; ur.015436561447.45]|Government Information Quarterly|2003|20|2|151-166|10.1016/s0740-624x(03)00021-2|pub.1015297126|6;[LaRose, Robert; Eastin, Matthew S.]|[ur.0634303551.63; ur.0737056724.32]|Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media|2004|48|3|358-377|10.1207/s15506878jobem4803_2|pub.1016202336|555;[Ajzen, Icek]|[ur.011652717561.39]|Springer Series in Social Psychology|1985|||11-39|10.1007/978-3-642-69746-3_2|pub.1019346517|9400;[Grubesic, Tony H.]|[ur.01102232364.97]|Information Economics and Policy|2006|18|4|423-448|10.1016/j.infoecopol.2006.05.001|pub.1024247377|88;[Wilhelm, Anthony G.]|[]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|279-286|10.1080/01972240309482|pub.1025361280|10;[Mills, Bradford F.; Whitacre, Brian E.]|[ur.014170025161.80; ur.0576564754.20]|Growth and Change|2003|34|2|219-243|10.1111/1468-2257.00215|pub.1025842918|91;[Pigg, Kenneth E.; Crank, Laura D.]|[ur.016003636061.49; ur.013751661514.53]|Community Development|2005|36|1|65-76|10.1080/15575330509489872|pub.1033802015|11;[Strover, Sharon; Chapman, Gary; Waters, Jody]|[ur.012341524001.11; ; ]|Telecommunications Policy|2004|28|7-8|465-485|10.1016/j.telpol.2004.05.008|pub.1035876282|46;[Hollifield, C.Ann; Donnermeyer, Joseph F]|[ur.015703100245.27; ur.01165325243.27]|Government Information Quarterly|2003|20|2|135-150|10.1016/s0740-624x(03)00035-2|pub.1040349281|71;[Prieger, James E.]|[ur.014605206564.75]|Economic Inquiry|2003|41|2|346-363|10.1093/ei/cbg013|pub.1046360997|137;[LaRose, Robert; Met, Jennifer]|[ur.0634303551.63; ]|Journal of Communication|1989|39|3|48-60|10.1111/j.1460-2466.1989.tb01039.x|pub.1047772160|15;[Parker, Edwin B]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|2000|24|4|281-290|10.1016/s0308-5961(00)00018-5|pub.1048088240|98;[Tornatzky, L.

This testbed is located in two areas and has total 22 nodes which are installed on the power poles in these areas. Two areas are connected to a control server at Niigata university with broadband wireless access systems using 5 GHz band via a gate way node at the local-government office, which is located at the center of two areas. Each node has two wireless LAN interfaces with IEEE 802.11b/g and a wireless LAN access point. We measure the throughput and the packet transmission successful ratio of links in our testbed.

It is said that the growing digital divide has added one more dimension to the already skewed process of development-underdevelopment (Castells, 2000). In reality however it has more to do with the deprivation of information and knowledge than the non-availability of hardware and connectivity. To overcome this, it is necessary to look from a fresh perspective and introduce a new socio-organizational model that builds on the principles of Information Society (Castells, 2000), Economics of Knowledge (Machlup, 1962; Arthur, 1985; Romer, 1990) and Social Capital (Coleman, 1988; Putnam, 1995) to ensure better development of human and social capital.",Global Information Technologies,2008,,,1829-1853,"Tan, Felix B.; Shaligram, Anil",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014319488,0,

Particular attention is paid to exploring the problem of the digital divide and specifying the key factors that impede the spread of ICT progress on the continent. There are several realistic ways in which African nations may benefit from ICT, including immediate and tangible results in medicine, education and economic development. The authors set forth a number of recommendations on bridging the infrastructure and knowledge gap. They also evaluate the efficiency of regional initiatives and international assistance programmes to Africa for enhancing the ICT sector and study the phenomenon of cultural imperialism in this respect. In conclusion, the authors speculate on the future of ICT in Africa and on the continent's ability to bridge the development gap with the help of new technologies.",Information Communication & Society,2003,6,1,42-56,"Polikanov, Dmitry; Abramova, Irina",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040157771,23,"[Oshikoya, T.

It is said that the growing digital divide has added one more dimension to the already skewed process of development-underdevelopment (Castells, 2000). In reality however it has more to do with the deprivation of information and knowledge than the non-availability of hardware and connectivity. To overcome this, it is necessary to look from a fresh perspective and introduce a new socio-organizational model that builds on the principles of Information Society (Castells, 2000), Economics of Knowledge (Machlup, 1962; Arthur, 1985; Romer, 1990) and Social Capital (Coleman, 1988; Putnam, 1995) to ensure better development of human and social capital.",Encyclopedia of Developing Regional Communities with Information and Communication Technology,2005,,,528-532,"Marshall, Stewart; Taylor, Wal; Yu, Xinghuo; Shaligram, Anil",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033132172,0,

In this study, the research directions and agenda of social computing for an aging society are presented, which have two major directions: basic study and applied study. Regarding human aspects in social computing mainly dealt with in the basic study, existing research and related theories on cognitive characteristics, information usage patterns, and social network site use of older adults were examined.

pub.1018169112,10.1145/1943403.1943428,PaperSketch: a paper-digital collaborative remote sketching tool,"Pen and paper support the rapid production of sketches. However, the paper interface is not always optimal for collaborative sketching as seen in brainstorming sessions where multiple parties would often like to communicate and participate in the sketching synchronously. Novel interactive paper solutions may provide the answer by bridging the paper-digital divide and allowing users to sketch on paper simultaneously while capturing the actions digitally. We present an analysis of collaborative sketching activities in working environments with remote participation. After highlighting the importance of paper for natural interaction in these settings, we introduce PaperSketch, an interactive paper-digital tool for collaborative remote sketching. We discuss the collaborative development of ideas based on the prototype and outline how important feedback issues have been addressed by utilising spatial constraints and multimodal features.",Proceedings of the 15th international conference on Intelligent user interfaces - IUI '11,2011,,,155-164,"Weibel, Nadir; Signer, Beat; Norrie, Moira C.; Hofstetter, Hermann; Jetter, Hans-Christian; Reiterer, Harald","University of California, San Diego; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; ETH Zurich; University of Konstanz",United States; Belgium; Switzerland; Germany,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018169112,10,"[Ou, Jiazhi; Chen, Xilin; Fussell, Susan R.; Yang, Jie]|[ur.07713175763.62; ur.015156374527.80; ur.013653535022.01; ur.013442013645.66]|Proceedings of the eleventh ACM international conference on Multimedia  - MULTIMEDIA '03|2003|||100-101|10.1145/957013.957034|pub.1001492033|25;[Scott, Stacey D.; Sheelagh, M.; Carpendale, T.; Inkpen, Kori M.]|[ur.01230264576.08; ur.013307514243.23; ur.012510110567.12; ur.014606226031.29]|Proceedings of the 2004 ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work  - CSCW '04|2004|||294-303|10.1145/1031607.1031655|pub.1002063595|378;[Tang, John C.; Minneman, Scott L.]|[ur.012423545522.62; ur.010367227033.01]|Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems Empowering people - CHI '90|1990|||313-320|10.1145/97243.97302|pub.1004610385|132;[Ishii, H.]|[ur.013205227403.15]|Proceedings of the 1990 ACM conference on Computer-supported cooperative work  - CSCW '90|1990|||13-26|10.1145/99332.99337|pub.1006134697|141;[Brocklehurst, E.R.]|[ur.010427663133.56]|International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|1991|34|1|69-95|10.1016/0020-7373(91)90051-8|pub.1006860334|12;[Brave, Scott; Ishii, Hiroshi; Dahley, Andrew]|[ur.014712054055.54; ur.015664645335.87; ur.016305015055.67]|Proceedings of the 1998 ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work  - CSCW '98|1998|||169-178|10.1145/289444.289491|pub.1007031486|208;[Yeh, Ron B.; Paepcke, Andreas; Klemmer, Scott R.]|[ur.011326706353.24; ur.012132555134.91; ur.011610605065.29]|Proceedings of the 21st annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology - UIST '08|2008|||111-120|10.1145/1449715.1449734|pub.1011815498|30;[Aliakseyeu, Dzmitry; Martens, Jean-Bernard; Rauterberg, Matthias]|[ur.010315432124.18; ur.013033270154.69; ur.01324715757.91]|Interacting with Computers|2006|18|4|528-555|10.1016/j.intcom.2005.11.010|pub.1012639138|26;[Tang, John C.; Leifer, Larry J.]|[ur.012423545522.62; ur.0625520450.25]|Proceedings of the 1988 ACM conference on Computer-supported cooperative work - CSCW '88|1988|||244-249|10.1145/62266.62285|pub.1014786563|85;[Boyarski, Daniel; Buchanan, Richard]|[ur.014062625613.47; ur.015455566613.37]|Interactions|1994|1|2|25-35|10.1145/174809.174812|pub.1015500233|18;[Bekker, Mathilde M.; Olson, Judith S.; Olson, Gary M.]|[ur.016307464747.36; ur.012304646662.26; ur.013707376365.07]|Proceedings of the conference on Designing interactive systems processes, practices, methods, & techniques - DIS '95|1995|||157-166|10.1145/225434.225452|pub.1021021194|81;[Song, Hyunyoung; Grossman, Tovi; Fitzmaurice, George; Guimbretiere, François; Khan, Azam; Attar, Ramtin; Kurtenbach, Gordon]|[ur.016000054470.05; ur.010731732773.04; ur.012141303053.37; ur.01014451034.41; ur.011473011373.62; ur.015056600303.05; ur.013233261631.87]|Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|2009|||143-152|10.1145/1518701.1518726|pub.1027082921|52;[Wellner, Pierre]|[ur.012602777271.07]|Communications of the ACM|1993|36|7|87-96|10.1145/159544.159630|pub.1028801418|671;[Forbus, Kenneth D.; Usher, Jeffrey]|[ur.01272650612.57; ur.01340764012.52]|Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Intelligent user interfaces  - IUI '02|2002|||71-77|10.1145/502716.502730|pub.1029241163|32;[Landay, James A.; Myers, Brad A.]|[ur.011414323125.32; ur.015213777465.18]|Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems - CHI '95|1995|||43-50|10.1145/223904.223910|pub.1036724107|240;[van der Lugt, Remko]|[ur.07641266755.05]|Proceedings of the fourth conference on Creativity & cognition  - C&C '02|2002|||72-79|10.1145/581710.581723|pub.1037964024|54;[Bly, S.

Despite the commitment of all countries to free flow of information and access to knowledge sources based upon social justice there are still ethical problems of the digital divide. The attitudes of respondents towards science and computers in both Japan and Thailand is compared between 1993 and a decades later. There is more positive support towards science and technology in general in Thailand than in Japan, but both countries continue to be positive in attitude. There is a clear social mandate in both countries for their government policies promoting the development of information technology and science and technology in general.

Data on access to ICTs, as well as business‐relevant behaviors and attitudes, was collected by a multi‐stage probability sample of women microentrepreneurs in Mumbai, India. Main findings include evidence that in urban microenterprises owned by women, business growth is a function of ICT access and is related to motivation to use ICTs for business purposes; and that the more positive a woman microentrepreneur feels about her status and power because of her business, the more she will be motivated to use ICTs in support of her business.

Desire for computer skills increased among respondents with lower levels of educational attainment. Respondents with higher levels of education were more likely to use computers at home andwork. Non-Whites were more likely than Whites to agree that technological information is key to citizen empowerment and that computers should be accessible to all citizens, as well as reporting increased interest in learning computer skills.

Africa, in particular, has the highest growth rate of mobile phones, presenting opportunities not only to create locally relevant mobile services but also to reduce the digital divide. To help local IT entrepreneurs exploit this opportunity, the World Wide Web Foundation started the Mobile Entrepreneurs in Africa program. The goal is to teach potential entrepreneurs about existing technologies, the market for services, and business principles specific to the mobile sector. The program, which is in the early phases of implementation in Ghana, Kenya, and Senegal, targets small initiatives and is articulated around four major stages: demystification, capacity building, incubation, and access to capital.",IT Professional,2011,13,2,60-62,"Froumentin, Max; Boyera, Stephane",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1061407269,1,

This is creating a new imperative to address the digital divide.

The article explores what has been learned from some of the Australian initiatives for connecting the unconnected to online government services. It concludes that greater attention to community-based human capital development is needed. It gives examples of factors needed for success in building socially marginalized communities’ interest, enthusiasm and capacity to interact and communicate via online technologies, thereby contributing to how successful e-government can be in delivering gains in efficiency and improved services.",International Review of Administrative Sciences,2005,71,1,109-118,"Dugdale, Anni; Daly, Anne; Papandrea, Franco; Maley, Maria",University of Canberra,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1053069635,79,"[Harding, Ann; Lloyd, Rachel; Warren, Neil]|[; ; ]|The Distributional Effects of Government Spending and Taxation|2006|||176-201|10.1057/9780230378605_7|pub.1048018076|8;[Oudshoorn, Nelly; Pinch, Trevor]|[]|How Users Matter|2003||||10.7551/mitpress/3592.001.0001|pub.1110619695|570"

However, the static nature of paper and limited structural information encoded in classical paginated formats make it difficult to map between parts of a printed instance of a document and logical elements of a digital instance of the same document, especially taking document revisions into account. We present a solution to this problem based on a model that combines metadata of the digital and printed instances to enable a seamless mapping between digital documents and their physical counterparts on paper.

The moment of definition and consolidation of an interactive digital TV technology in Brazil provides us with a unique opportunity to cope with the digital divide issues. Making sure that iDTV contents and devices are flexible enough so that people are able to perceive, understand and interact with them is an essential requirement for the democratization of information via TV broadcasting. This paper investigates the basis for setting an interactive digital TV in Brazil by analyzing the Brazilian scenario and by proposing recommendations for the design of accessible user interfaces for iDTV applications; this basis is illustrated with the design of ciT-goV, a t-gov application prototype.",Proceedings of the 7th ACM conference on Designing interactive systems - DIS '08,2008,,,379-385,"Schibelsky, Lara; Piccolo, Godoy; Cecília, Maria; Baranauskas, Calani",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032339150,4,"[Gawlinski, Mark]|[]||2003||||10.4324/9780080522111|pub.1004485171|25;[Chorianopoulos, Konstantinos]|[ur.013535616133.52]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2007|4397||43-57|10.1007/978-3-540-71025-7_4|pub.1025457674|6;[Piccolo, Lara Schibelsky Godoy; Baranauskas, Maria Cecília C.]|[ur.015425541041.26; ur.015607075672.70]|Proceedings of VII Brazilian symposium on Human factors in computing systems  - IHC '06|2006|||1-10|10.1145/1298023.1298025|pub.1032189152|8"

Of some 902 nonprofit organizations in the religious and charitable category, 90% used the Internet for email and Web access. Additionally, 66.7% had Web sites. OLS regression and bivariate correlational analysis suggests that organizations with larger fund balances, greater budget percentages attributed to ICT, and a history of early adoption are statistically significantly more likely to have greater bandwidth connectivity to the Internet. In contrast, organizations with greater free cash flow are statistically significantly less likely to have greater bandwidth, although organization size does not correlate significantly with bandwidth connectivity.",Trends in Communication,2003,11,1,81-94,"Zimmer, Eric A.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028232558,4,

Certain ICT-induced developments such as globalization tend to leave the poor developing countries behind the global development agenda. In this article, we recognize the need for global-scale countervailing policies to establish the true pattern and structure of poverty and ICTs consumption and utilization in the developing countries in order to determine how the ICTs-heavy activities of the rich developing countries can be aligned with the ICTs needs of the poor developing countries. This will help ensure that ICTs are contributing in the development and globalization of the poor countries. The article recommends strategies that can be adopted to boost the participation of poor developing countries in the globalization process.",Information Development,2006,22,3,167-179,"Nwagwu, Williams Ezinwa",University of Ibadan,Nigeria,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022549358,8,"[James, Jeffrey]|[]||1999||||10.1057/9780230377431|pub.1004958332|19;[]|[]|JAMA Surgery|2001|136|1|89-89|10.1001/archsurg.136.1.89|pub.1051718557|33;[Mody, Ashoka; Wheeler, David]|[ur.015772755223.72; ur.016565353021.67]||1990||||10.1007/978-1-349-11312-5|pub.1084900718|13;[Ghosh, Jayati]|[ur.011213700142.62]|Social Change|1999|29|3-4|333-334|10.1177/004908579902900425|pub.1091460258|6;[Standing, Guy]|[]||1999||||10.1007/978-1-349-27576-2|pub.1109704690|289;[Kayani, Rogati; Dymond, Andrew]|[; ]|World Bank Technical Papers|1997||||10.1596/0-8213-3948-6|pub.1109731005|20"

Yet very often, analyses tend to reflect personal biases or propose incredulous scenarios. This essay does not seek to rewrite old rules for a new economy; rather, it seeks to provide a balanced perspective on opportunities and challenges facing East Asia, using a multidisciplinary approach. It finds that although these countries differ in their levels of development in the Information Economy, their prospects of growth depend on the policies that they choose to pursue. Deliberations on economic issues (such as the potential for productivity gains from ICT), political concerns (including the need to cope with changing government‐people dynamics), and social changes (such as the diminution of local cultures and the widening digital divide) often involve both costs as well as benefits.

pub.1094549657,10.1109/icee.2010.951,Challenges and Countermeasures of E-Political Communication,"Along with the rapid development of information communications and the internet technology, mankind has entered the internet era. As for civil society, network media means the new carriers and new channels of citizen participation; it also means a new kind of democratic manner. While for governments, such network media means innovation of their governance model. However, the communication between e-government and civil society in network era is faced with a formidable array of challenges, mainly as follows: First, the network advocates liberalism, while it denies any authority beyond the constraints of time, with anonymity and virtual characteristics. Under current circumstance, in which the network legislation is comparatively lagging behind and on-line identity authentication technology is inadequate and imperfect, it can easily lead to the spread of the disorder in citizen network participation. Second, the e-government may conduct covert network political control over civil society through the ""information bombardment"", ""false information"", ""information supervision"" and other ways; the powers of the internet era are clearly shifted to the hands of technocrats, thus this may lead to the so-called ""technocrats serving the citizens"" so that the substantive democracy of civil society might be impaired. Third, blind repeated construction of the government website, enforcement of ""Government Online Project"", and imperfect public information infrastructure, all set up many obstacles for the communication. Fourth, the ""digital divide"" has led to the fact that political communication cannot represent the interests of the public; the governments can hardly make an appropriate decision in line with public opinion. Fifth, government sectors, civil servants, and citizens are lack of awareness and ability in terms of network information. In response to these problems, the government should actively build up open government and the legal protection system; establish the protection mechanism ensuring network political and orderly participation among civil citizen, conduct ""network real-name system"", protect the lawful rights and interests of citizen participation (including the network participation) through the establishment of ""Citizen Participation Law""; in addition, the government should take measures towards the elimination of the ""digital divide"", foster ""e-citizens"" and promote the awareness and ability of network information among government sectors, civil servants, and citizens.",2010 International Conference on E-Business and E-Government,2010,,,3794-3797,"Meng, Gao; Bing, Chen",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094549657,0,
pub.1051813703,10.1108/17506161011028786,An exploratory study on the role of intermediaries in delivering public services in Madinah City,"The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of the intermediary in delivering public services from government departments to different stakeholders (business and citizens) and to highlight the challenges that face the development of e‐government services in the context of Madinah City, in Saudi Arabia. The paper uses a broad literature review to identify significant factors that contribute to e‐government adoption and diffusion success. These factors are then used as a basis for analyzing the findings from a case study that focuses on the concept of intermediaries for e‐government service delivery in Saudi Arabia. To investigate a less‐recognized phenomenon, such as the use of intermediaries in e‐government contexts, the authors adopt a qualitative case study approach to gain further understating. This method allowed examining the phenomenon in its natural settings through employing multiple methods of data collection. Further, it gave the researchers enough room to get a closer look at the reasons behind introducing the intermediary concept in the e‐government context and provided considerable flexibility during interviews and observations. The results of this paper indicate that digital divide and poor infrastructure to conduct payments (secure transactions) for e‐government services was hindering citizens' adoption of e‐services in Saudi Arabia. Thus, the intermediary concept was facilitating citizens' access to e‐government services and helping to reduce the digital divide in Saudi Arabia. The findings also show that intermediaries helped in increasing the availability of e‐government services. Additionally, this paper finds that trust between the service provider (government) and service requester (citizens and businesses) is an important factor that influences not only e‐government adoption and diffusion, but also the role of electronic intermediary (e‐offices) in facilitating this adoption. The authors take into account the most salient adoption factors when introducing e‐government systems. Electronic intermediaries may help to enhance the understating and analysis of those adoption factors in government settings and facilitate government departments in realizing the importance of intermediaries' role in e‐government contexts. Furthermore, this paper significantly contributes to the knowledge and practice of e‐government adoption and diffusion and provides sufficient support to decision makers in expediting e‐government adoption and diffusion.",Transforming Government People Process and Policy,2010,4,1,14-36,"Al‐Sobhi, Faris; Weerakkody, Vishanth; Kamal, Muhammad Mustafa",Brunel University London,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1051813703,41,"[Chen, H.]|[ur.01320367405.07]|Decision Support Systems|2003|34|3|223-227|10.1016/s0167-9236(02)00118-5|pub.1001421155|53;[Richards, Keith A.; Jones, Eli]|[; ur.014545336325.37]|Industrial Marketing Management|2008|37|2|120-130|10.1016/j.indmarman.2006.08.005|pub.1002409661|198;[Carter, Lemuria]|[ur.010501313522.42]|Transforming Government People Process and Policy|2008|2|3|147-161|10.1108/17506160810902167|pub.1002981871|78;[Gefen, David; Rose, Gregory M.; Warkentin, Merrill; Pavlou, Paul A.]|[ur.010724440512.07; ur.012601410205.94; ur.014404213724.32; ur.016166254325.43]|Journal of Global Information Management|2005|13|1|54-78|10.4018/jgim.2005010103|pub.1003512069|110;[Lee, Sang M.; Tan, Xin; Trimi, Silvana]|[ur.010605430361.02; ; ur.010664037513.94]|Communications of the ACM|2005|48|10|99-104|10.1145/1089107.1089112|pub.1003732488|224;[Sarkar, Mitrabarun; Butler, Brian; Steinfield, Charles]|[ur.015372642227.26; ur.015731707377.93; ur.013651017147.33]|Journal of Business Research|1998|41|3|215-221|10.1016/s0148-2963(97)00064-7|pub.1004714039|98;[Cavaye, A.L.M.]|[ur.015214656367.74]|Information Systems Journal|1996|6|3|227-242|10.1111/j.1365-2575.1996.tb00015.x|pub.1007408940|313;[Al-Fakhri, Maher O.; Cropf, Robert A.; Kelly, Patrick; Higgs, Gary]|[; ur.010446004635.11; ; ]|International Journal of Electronic Government Research|2008|4|2|59-85|10.4018/jegr.2008040105|pub.1008847687|28;[Jaeger, Paul T; Thompson, Kim M]|[ur.011542112017.14; ur.014776367265.07]|Government Information Quarterly|2003|20|4|389-394|10.1016/j.giq.2003.08.001|pub.1009664461|269;[Pan, Shan-Ling; Tan, Chee-Wee; Lim, Eric T.K.]|[ur.014246137254.98; ur.010575342171.01; ur.016667225543.30]|Decision Support Systems|2006|42|1|237-250|10.1016/j.dss.2004.12.001|pub.1009956788|60;[Virili, Francesco; Sorrentino, Maddalena]|[ur.010744617027.27; ur.010706441744.66]|Transforming Government People Process and Policy|2009|3|3|227-247|10.1108/17506160910979342|pub.1010940051|22;[Akman, Ibrahim; Yazici, Ali; Mishra, Alok; Arifoglu, Ali]|[ur.013074555647.64; ur.016524311475.34; ur.010276651355.44; ur.012727113212.59]|Government Information Quarterly|2005|22|2|239-257|10.1016/j.giq.2004.12.001|pub.1011837196|172;[Carter, Lemuria; Weerakkody, Vishanth]|[ur.010501313522.42; ur.07462137703.88]|Information Systems Frontiers|2008|10|4|473-482|10.1007/s10796-008-9103-6|pub.1012368972|259;[Dawes, Sharon S; Pardo, Theresa A; Cresswell, Anthony M]|[ur.011614341055.31; ur.012053623220.70; ur.015070517706.01]|Government Information Quarterly|2004|21|1|3-23|10.1016/j.giq.2003.11.001|pub.1012556350|71;[van Dam, Nik; Evers, Vanessa; Arts, Florann A.]|[; ur.012673467533.54; ]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2005|3081||310-324|10.1007/11407546_18|pub.1013166005|13;[Ebrahim, Zakareya; Irani, Zahir]|[; ur.012462056043.16]|Business Process Management Journal|2005|11|5|589-611|10.1108/14637150510619902|pub.1013996034|399;[Sarikas, Omiros D.; Weerakkody, Vishanth]|[ur.014276566507.51; ur.07462137703.88]|Transforming Government People Process and Policy|2007|1|2|153-173|10.1108/17506160710751986|pub.1019662978|62;[Teo, Thompson S.

Today the 'new consumers' positively use digital and information technology in purchasing. To understand these consumers' new purchase tendency, the study examined the actual conditions 1) of consumers' use of digital and information technology, 2) of digital devide between consumers, and 3) the consumer's attitude to changes of their lifestyle which digital convergence could result in. The subjects were thousand male and female adults. The data were collected from a survey conducted by Embrain, a research firm in Seoul, in the period of June 1st, 2007 June 10th, 2007. The results show: 1. Most subjects have computers, their Internet use is their general life, and they have lots of exposure opportunities to digital information. They positively and actively use information technology. 2. Between male and female subjects, and between old and young generation there is a significant digital gap. But the gap between regional areas is statistically not significant. 3. The subject's attitude to digital convergence society shows both positive expectation and negative concerns. Concludingly, to embody a desirable digital convergence society, it is necessary to be searched the ways which can decrease the digital gap and policy to share benefit that information technology can give to consumers.",Korean Journal of Human Ecology,2008,17,2,279-292,"Yoo, Hyun-Jung",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038009879,1,"[Goolsbee, Austan; Klenow, Peter J.]|[ur.014677654741.57; ur.010423026174.84]|The Journal of Law and Economics|2002|45|2|317-343|10.1086/344399|pub.1058640424|226;[Brynjolfsson, Erik; Smith, Michael D.]|[ur.016410366727.06; ur.013732004511.06]|Management Science|2000|46|4|563-585|10.1287/mnsc.46.4.563.12061|pub.1064721997|1561"
pub.1035740189,10.1145/1930321.1930340,A 'digital gap' between developed country and least developed country: a comparative case study between Nepal and Korea,"The 'Digital gap' is a very common terminology in e-government now days. It is the gap between ""have"" and ""have not"" in terms of information use and access. There have been many efforts carried out by different sectors in filling this gap. E-government is considered as a tool to reduce this gap along with enhancing the economic, political, societal condition of a nation. Few countries have achieved maximum benefits in reducing the gap through e-government and many countries are still struggling on it. There are still big differences between these countries. Based upon the achievements and other defined parameters, UN does the survey in every two years and makes a report. As per the report, some countries are successful enough to increase its position in UN index and some countries are not successful. We try to identify the reason behind these in this paper. We consider two countries, highly developed and least developed We take Korean case as developed country and Nepalese case as least developed country and do comparative study in this paper. Finding the force that makes Korea to move up and Nepal to move down is the main theme of this paper. At the end of the paper we provide the recommendations for Korea to maintain its position and also for Nepal to move up from existing position.",Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance - ICEGOV '10,2010,,,85-90,"Pokharel, Manish; Kim, Young Sik; Park, Jong Sou",Korea Aerospace University,South Korea,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035740189,1,"[Chen, Y.

Older users still use the Web less than younger users, and more commonly experience significant usability issues when they do. With the emergence of Web 2.0 technologies, we have the ability to close that divide and ensure the Web is universally usable for people of all ages. It requires taking what we know of “senior surfer” requirements and applying them to Web 2.0 interfaces. This paper examines the changing nature of the Web, the Senior Web user, and assesses how Web 2.0 technologies can – but do not yet - improve universal access for everyone. Pilot studies support these hypotheses; future studies are planned to further examine these issues.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2007,4554,,868-876,"Chadwick-Dias, Ann; Bergel, Marguerite; Tullis, Thomas S.",Fidelity Investments (United States),United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047152891,21,"[Chadwick-Dias, Ann; McNulty, Michelle; Tullis, Tom]|[ur.013665325511.70; ur.016471540123.03; ur.010111317171.19]|ACM SIGCAPH Computers and the Physically Handicapped|2002||73-74|30-37|10.1145/960201.957212|pub.1036366979|103;[Chadwick-Dias, Ann; Tedesco, Donna; Tullis, Tom]|[ur.013665325511.70; ur.014306133312.05; ur.010111317171.19]|Extended abstracts of the 2004 conference on Human factors and computing systems  - CHI '04|2004|||1391-1394|10.1145/985921.986072|pub.1045661518|28;[Chadwick-Dias, Ann; McNulty, Michelle; Tullis, Tom]|[ur.013665325511.70; ur.016471540123.03; ur.010111317171.19]|Proceedings of the 2003 conference on Universal usability  - CUU '03|2003|||30|10.1145/957205.957212|pub.1098893138|61"

By offering free wireless Internet access, the Qatari government hopes to increase accessibility of e-government services and encourage their citizens to actively participate in the global information society with a view of bridging the digital divide. This research proposes an extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model for examining the adoption and diffusion of iPark services in Qatar. A pilot survey was conducted of iPark users using an extended version of the UTAUT model to explain the intention to use.

This chapter takes an institutional approach. Derived from a quantitative assessment of the 238 largest cities in the United States, we use multivariate modeling of variables to illuminate what factors affect institutional e-government development efforts at the local level. We find that the concentration of oft cited digital divide populations has no relation to the quality of e-government in U.S. municipalities. This is true for race and ethnicity variables as well as income and age variables when measured against any index developed for this analysis. The only hypothesis that holds significance is the education variable.

pub.1014466386,10.1007/s12626-010-0011-0,Broadband Demand Analysis for Network Building,"Abstract.An increase of broadband demand is forecasted by transitional methods that consider the effect of this increase through many factors, such as customer requirement diversification, and new service introduction and deployment under competition. Broadband demand forecasting has become important for closing the digital divide, promoting regional developments, and constructing networks economically; therefore, a demand forecast model that considers the mechanisms of market structure is necessary. In this paper, a demand analysis method for broadband access combining macro- and micro-data mining is proposed, and the service choice behaviour of customers is introduced as a customer model not only to express the macro trend of market structure, but also to consider area marketing. The proposed method can estimate the potential demand, determine the point at which broadband demand growth peaks in a specified area, and support a decision for ultra high-speed broadband access facility installation.",The Review of Socionetwork Strategies,2010,4,1,17-28,"Iwashita, Motoi; Nishimatsu, Ken; Kurosawa, Takeshi; Shimogawa, Shinsuke",Chiba Institute of Technology; Tokyo University of Science; NTT (Japan),Japan; Japan; Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014466386,2,"[Fader, Peter S.; Hardie, Bruce G.

Newer studies point to the existence of other factors such as the lack of culturally relevant content. Driven by this issue, this study provides a preliminary map of the “nature” of Web-based content about U.S. Latinas, a community that has traditionally been underrepresented in information systems. The nature of the content was explored and analyzed by examining attributes such as type of site, language of site, topic(s), producer(s) of site, technical features, and targeted audience. The study also theorizes the lack of relevant content and discusses the possible social implications of the disparities in access to digital information technologies. Using content analysis, the study provides a framework with which to categorize and analyze Web content.

The outcome was not just a set of simplified services but a new device offering sophisticated functionalities tailored to the actual needs of the targeted users and respectful of their personal meaningful practices.

However, PC and broadband penetration are approximately 3 % and 2 % respectively. Desirability & affordability are becoming the most influencing consumption factors for the growing middle class. Bringing technology to large and upcoming middle class consumers requires localization efforts that define “value for money” in the local context. Although the current numbers are small, India is seeing a rapid growth in broadband subscribers. There is national consensus on the economic impact of broadband today. The objective of this project is two-fold. First is to improve the desirability of PC by integrating Internet connectivity. Second objective is to improve the affordability of the PC through integration of connectivity, chassis and antenna optimizations.

pub.1094180591,10.1109/icet.2005.1558888,SIP-Based QoS Control over Satellite Networks,"Satelliteaccess networks (SAN) are expected to play a decisive role in bridging the digital divide through providing broadband access to multimedia services in geographical area where terrestrial access networks like cable or ADSL cannot be deployed. SANs currently lack a clear QoS architecture in order to fit seamlessly into the end-to-end NGN framework. Several architectures mixing IP QoS layer mechanisms with specific satellite MAC dynamic allocation schemes are already designed. However, very few multimedia applications can actually benefit from these architectures since most of them are not QoS aware. This work presents a SIP based multimedia signaling architecture where existing SIP applications can beneficiate from a QoS enabled IP network without undergoing any adjustments or modifications. In addition to that, the realization of the proposed solution is also described along with its performance evaluation tests and their results on an emulated satellite platform, providing DiffServ services, which was implemented during the European IST SATIP6 project.","Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Emerging Technologies, 2005.",2005,,,242-245,"Qureshi, Rehan Inam; Alphand, Olivier",Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology,Pakistan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094180591,0,

pub.1091788800,10.1002/9781405186407.wbiece059.pub2,Exposure to the Internet,"How has the spread of the → Internet been studied and explained? Numerous studies have established that the diffusion of Internet access follows an S‐shaped curve. What is not well understood is the factors responsible for different levels of Internet access among different countries (→ Digital Divide; Media Use, International Comparison of). Many theories of the diffusion of innovations, such as the Bass model, focus on individual factors, such as perceived need (Bass 1969; → Diffusion of Information and Innovation; Media Use by Social Variable).

Yet, global connectivity is not evenly distributed throughout the metropolis. As recent studies show, information-dependent businesses tend to concentrate in particular quarters in and around the City of London and the West End despite the spatial flexibility that modern telecommunication technology allows for. This study seeks to demonstrate how the modern ``digital divide'' that rips through London continuously evolved from similarly uneven connectivity patterns in the telegraphic network of late 19th-century London. With the help of historical Geographic Information Systems (GIS), these patterns will be visualized. This examination will show how important a role continuity played in the evolution of modern informational patterns and how this sheds new light on issues of technological dynamism and agency.",Social Science Computer Review,2009,27,3,437-451,"Wenzlhuemer, Roland",Heidelberg University,Germany,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063872707,1,"[David, Paul A.]|[ur.014213012535.11]|Cliometrica|2007|1|2|91-114|10.1007/s11698-006-0005-x|pub.1023210432|203;[Cook, Gary A S; Pandit, Naresh R; Beaverstock, Jonathan V; Taylor, Peter J; Pain, Kathy]|[ur.016206174377.22; ur.010130155211.77; ur.013160347623.48; ur.012160000217.19; ur.012020071623.78]|Environment and Planning A Economy and Space|2007|39|6|1325-1345|10.1068/a37380|pub.1053833023|72"

Telecenters and cyber cafés are one prevalent way to increase access. This paper suggests increasing access through currently existing, local businesses where people already gather and where proprietors already posses existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. This paper questions the prevailing emphasis on the “cyber'' characteristics of access, e.g., computing and internet access as is currently known, and attempts to refocus the conversation by considering computing and access in the context of the “café,” e.g., as public life in the sense of Habermas, which permits an in situ evolution of relevant access. This analysis is based on extant literature and direct ethnographic research in several public places in six countries. We offer example design perspectives based on a reflection of “third places” as inspiration for appropriate innovation in the provision of computing and communications. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Information Technology for Development,2005,11,1,77-95,"Salvador, Tony; Sherry, John W.; Urrutia, Alvaro E.",Intel (United States),United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050981326,34,"[Ivala, Eunice Ndeto]|[ur.011127760371.75]|Communicatio|2000|26|1|24-30|10.1080/02500160008537895|pub.1007454391|4;[Rogers, Everett M.]|[ur.01000703647.95]|The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety|1995|21|7|324-328|10.1016/s1070-3241(16)30155-9|pub.1052493318|471;[Gurstein, Michael]|[]|First Monday|2003|8|12||10.5210/fm.v8i12.1107|pub.1072710821|187;[]|[]|Choice|1990|27|07|27-4175-27-4175|10.5860/choice.27-4175|pub.1073296542|929;[]|[]||2000||||10.5040/9781474215701|pub.1099348543|172;[Castells, Manuel]|[]||2001||||10.1007/978-3-322-89613-1|pub.1109708492|1326"

Government initiatives to widen participation in education mean that students from hitherto non‐traditional backgrounds are more likely to be using libraries than previously. That the much discussed “digital divide” is indeed a reality, is confirmed by the author’s own recent research, “Barriers to libraries as agents of lifelong learning”, conducted at a UK university and two further education colleges. Social class and home access to information technology are shown as dividers impacting on the extent of use of all services offered by the learning resource centre.

They are united by a common framework of critically analysing discourses of e-shopping in the ‘digital age’. Firstly, myths surrounding e-shopping are deconstructed with a view to analysing the ‘sovereign consumer’ and the e-shopping experience. The second study considers home e-shopping in the UK. In an atmosphere where we are urged to engage with ICTs (information communication technologies) in all spheres of our lives, the domestication of ICTs necessitates consideration of the gendered family in gendered households. In conclusion, we argue those self-service aspects of e-shopping are not signs of empowerment and self-determination.

Because African countries rank very low on the global measure of e-government readiness, critical variables were studied to find out which policy and programmatic areas should become priority in bridging the gap. Findings from a multiple regression analysis indicate that the low ranking of African countries on the global e-government readiness index indicates that the countries would need to develop, first, the internal utilization capacity as well as an enhanced public access to information, communication, and technology (ICT) infrastructures.

pub.1014550534,10.1007/978-3-540-73279-2_111,RFID Cards: A New Deal for Elderly Accessibility,"Elderly adults face two serious challenges bridging the digital divide. First, many suffer from physical or cognitive disabilities, which inhibit computer use. Second, the “traditional” personal computer interface constitutes a foreign and forbidding paradigm. Consequently, elderly adults are less likely to access the Internet, and this lack of accessibility denies them increased social contact and access to information. This paper presents the design of a tangible user interface (TUI) for an email client that is suited to the physical, neurological, and cognitive needs of elderly users. A review of the TUI literature identifies radio frequency identification (RFID) tagged cards, integrated with standard personal computers, as a viable alternative to the mouse. These cards can represent interaction objects and actions, forming the basis for an interaction language.

However, it is difficult to find a conceptual framework that suggests how the national e-Strategy should be defined and applied by the target country. This creates more confusion for policy makers. This paper reviews previous research on national e-Strategies to recognize its significance as a major contributing factor. Based on that, this research defines the critical success factors of national e-Strategy and investigates the possibility of prioritizing factors by the scale of economy through a Delphi survey. By reviewing the evaluated status of e-Readiness and co-relating the evaluation with economic status, we may further investigate the significance of the digital divide and national e-Strategy. The outcome of this research may be applicable in differentiating critical success factors from general ingredients of National e-Strategy.",Government Information Quarterly,2009,26,1,25-34,"Yoon, Jeongwon; Chae, Myungsin",University of Seoul,South Korea,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1006715564,36,"[Keil, Mark; Tiwana, Amrit; Bush, Ashley]|[ur.013136272710.25; ur.011454216505.11; ur.011162404457.38]|Information Systems Journal|2002|12|2|103-119|10.1046/j.1365-2575.2002.00121.x|pub.1012449609|129;[Buckley, Chris]|[]|Library Management|1995|16|7|16-19|10.1108/01435129510093737|pub.1043003148|45;[Morolong, Bantu L.]|[ur.013277701645.99]|Social Science Computer Review|2007|26|2|267-271|10.1177/0894439307304227|pub.1063872642|8;[Wheelwright, Steven; Makridakis, Spyros; Makridakis, Spyros; Wheelwright, Steven; Gross, Charles W.; Peterson, Robin T.; Eby, Frank H.; O'Neill, William J.]|[; ; ; ; ; ; ; ]|Journal of Marketing Research|1978|15|4|656|10.2307/3150640|pub.1070213101|47;[Brancheau, James C.; Janz, Brian D.; Wetherbe, James C.]|[ur.07427511323.76; ur.015365770605.21; ur.010225071723.49]|MIS Quarterly|1996|20|2|225|10.2307/249479|pub.1102514997|389;[Heeks, Richard]|[ur.01241047651.15]|Information Polity|2003|7|2,3|97-114|10.3233/ip-2002-0008|pub.1108034980|118;[Kunstelj, Mateja; Vintar, Mirko]|[ur.012516653063.77; ur.0727532672.21]|Information Polity|2005|9|3,4|131-148|10.3233/ip-2004-0055|pub.1108036089|113;[Janssen, Davy; Rotthier, Sabine; Snijkers, Kris]|[ur.015250055067.97; ; ur.012537052767.98]|Information Polity|2005|9|3,4|121-130|10.3233/ip-2004-0051|pub.1108036753|59;[]|[]|Global E-Government Readiness Report 2005|2006||||10.18356/0bf9f932-en|pub.1120307928|5"

This solution is developed by the ADHOCSYS project, which is financed by the European Commission under the FP6 IST strategic objective “Broadband for All”. Challenges exist in various aspects in order to develop a robust and service-oriented network, including for example network architecture, application scenarios, auto-configuration, routing, QoS, security and authentication, power supply, hardware selection and software development, business model etc. Following a general vision of the project, two key aspects, i. e. routing and QoS, are presented in more details in this paper.",2007 IEEE Globecom Workshops,2007,,,1-5,"Paolo, Bucciol; Li, Frank Y.; Nikos, Fragoulis; Lorenzo, Vandoni",Polytechnic University of Turin; University Graduate Center; University of Patras,Italy; Norway; Greece,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095233442,7,"[Akyildiz, Ian F.; Wang, Xudong; Wang, Weilin]|[ur.011747477217.24; ur.014422467153.50; ]|Computer Networks|2005|47|4|445-487|10.1016/j.comnet.2004.12.001|pub.1004000795|2843;[Dixit, Sudhir; Pandharipande, Ashish]|[ur.011767275726.26; ur.010262252640.24]|IEEE Communications Magazine|2007|45|1|92-95|10.1109/mcom.2007.284543|pub.1061394484|5"

Hence, there is a great need for providing applications and interfaces in one's own language to tap into this vast knowledge reserve. In addition, access to the Internet is still a major problem in developing countries because of the “digital divide” and hand held devices such as PDAs and Mobile Phones are seen as enablers in bridging this gap. However, displaying cross-lingual content on these mobile devices is a non trivial task and there is a great need for robust mechanisms and infrastructure for content delivery in different languages on the fly.

In order to make broadband access available to these under served areas, several technical solutions are available with the capacity to provide high speed Internet access, video, telephony services, etc. This paper presents a cost-model and a tool for the evaluation of broadband access technologies (xDSL, HFC, FTTx, WiMAX, PLC and satellite), and compares two technologies: FTTx and WiMAX. Our tool compares these different access technologies in different scenarios, and examining the capital expense and deployment of building access networks with the same requisite performance using each technology. The cost model is limited to the access part of the network.

There are several initiatives to roll out Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in public places in South Africa, but the question arises as to whether people will be able to use it effectively. Is the backlog with regard to general education and training not so insurmountable that people from disadvantaged communities are not educable for computer usage? This paper reports on the experiences and observations of instructors during a word processing training course for people from such communities. An interaction model that incorporates user and interface limitations with the difficulties experienced, serves as framework for the discussion. It became clear that most of the difficulties that attendees experienced were related to lack of technological experience, a limitation that can be eliminated through practice and perseverance. Enough practice might also result in an attenuation of the effects of some psychological limitations.",Suid-Afrikaanse Tydskrif vir Natuurwetenskap en Tegnologie,2007,26,3,216-238,"Blignaut, Pieter; Dednam, Engela; Beelders, Tanya",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072234552,0,

Existing research is unclear about how effectively case management affects participation, nor, the impact of ICT on social work interventions. This paper describes the findings of qualitative research with service users about their experiences of case management and how ICT could further their involvement in critical decisions for families. Service users are keen to use ICT and this could help overcome the limitations of paper-based case management systems and exploit the communication potential of the internet and mobile phones. However, before ICT could be used, the complex ‘digital divide’ affecting disadvantaged families would need to be addressed and social workers’ understanding and current use of ICT would need to be explored.",International Journal of Information Communication Technologies and Human Development,2010,2,2,17-33,"Tregeagle, Susan",Western Sydney University,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043061035,3,"[Tregeagle, Susan;

pub.1042424519,10.1007/0-387-23120-x_24,Cybertroc: A barter system for the Information Society,"Barter — or troc in French — is the exchange of goods or services for other goods or services. It is the oldest form of commerce and continues to have an important role in even the most highly developed societies. Not least it is highly valuable for developing social capital among a community. The Information Society brings to barter both a new meaning for “community” and new mechanisms for exchange. In particular it may be a key motivator for bridging the digital divide, but providing a tangible, understandable purpose for joining the Information Society. The goal of CyberTroc — or Internet-based barter — is to connect people with needs to other capable of satisfying these needs. The Internet is an ideal means for facilitating barter, since it can provide a transactional capability at extremely low cost and since it can bring together communities that may be highly localized or may be very scattered.",IFIP International Federation for Information Processing,2005,161,,244-246,"Harrison, Colin",IBM Research - Zurich,Switzerland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042424519,0,

They have had a radical and widespread impact on our moral lives and hence on contemporary ethical debates. The Cambridge Handbook of Information and Computer Ethics, first published in 2010, provides an ambitious and authoritative introduction to the field, with discussions of a range of topics including privacy, ownership, freedom of speech, responsibility, technological determinism, the digital divide, cyber warfare, and online pornography. It offers an accessible and thoughtful survey of the transformations brought about by ICTs and their implications for the future of human life and society, for the evaluation of behaviour, and for the evolution of moral values and rights. It will be a valuable book for all who are interested in the ethical aspects of the information society in which we live.",The Cambridge Handbook of Information and Computer Ethics,2010,,,59-76,"van den Hoven, Jeroen",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042054533,20,

The chapter reviews how XO designers negotiated between ethics and feasibility as they confronted numerous problems including infrastructure, power consumption, hazardous materials, free vs. proprietary software, security, and the cost of labor.

This study therefore aimed to extend knowledge by examining Internet adoption and usage behaviour in a developing country (South Africa). Differences in Internet adoption between those from a group previously advantaged by apartheid and those from a group previously disadvantaged were speciJically examined. For the previously advantaged, Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Enjoyment, and Long-term Consequences of Use were found to influence Internet adoption. For the previously disadvantaged, the main influence was Perceived Usefulness, with Perceived Ease of Use having an indirect effect through Perceived Usefulness. DtfSerences in Internet experience and exposure to technology largely explained the observed results as a result of varying socio-economic backgrounds between the majorities in the two groups. The implications of these findings in respect of the digital divide are discussed.",Journal of Global Information Technology Management,2003,6,4,6-26,"Brown, Irwin; Licker, Paul",University of Cape Town; Oakland University,South Africa; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025356632,42,"[Eaton, Liberty; Louw, Johann]|[ur.015213770147.25; ]|The Journal of Social Psychology|2000|140|2|210-217|10.1080/00224540009600461|pub.1007848944|115;[Straub, Detmar; Keil, Mark; Brenner, Walter]|[ur.012470601004.22; ur.013136272710.25; ]|Information & Management|1997|33|1|1-11|10.1016/s0378-7206(97)00026-8|pub.1013690596|585;[Anandarajan, Murugan; Igbaria, Magid; Anakwe, Uzoamaka P]|[ur.013214736057.55; ur.01014261436.52; ur.015631103235.46]|International Journal of Information Management|2002|22|1|47-65|10.1016/s0268-4012(01)00040-8|pub.1013850141|138;[Lederer, Albert L.; Maupin, Donna J.; Sena, Mark P.; Zhuang, Youlong]|[ur.015336170477.62; ur.010145452115.30; ur.016170164177.90; ur.013202557024.19]|Decision Support Systems|2000|29|3|269-282|10.1016/s0167-9236(00)00076-2|pub.1018520299|720;[Phahlamohlaka, Jackie; Lotriet, Hugo]|[ur.012426342010.39; ur.012246605416.03]|Systems Theory and Practice in the Knowledge Age|2002|||283-291|10.1007/978-1-4615-0601-0_33|pub.1023385919|3;[Sutton, Steve G.]|[ur.012675716165.51]|International Journal of Accounting Information Systems|2000|1|1|1-8|10.1016/s1467-0895(99)00002-0|pub.1024996029|87;[Moon, Ji-Won; Kim, Young-Gul]|[; ur.013215660652.17]|Information & Management|2001|38|4|217-230|10.1016/s0378-7206(00)00061-6|pub.1028894893|2056;[Chau, Patrick Y.K.]|[ur.016133275022.18]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1996|13|2|185-204|10.1080/07421222.1996.11518128|pub.1031216235|500;[Agarwal, Ritu; Prasad, Jayesh]|[ur.011563777065.56; ur.014112400413.27]|Decision Sciences|1997|28|3|557-582|10.1111/j.1540-5915.1997.tb01322.x|pub.1046518278|859;[Teo, Thompson S.H; Lim, Vivien K.G; Lai, Raye Y.C]|[ur.014043136677.02; ur.013454743521.10; ur.012726336572.36]|Omega|1999|27|1|25-37|10.1016/s0305-0483(98)00028-0|pub.1049500761|737;[Venkatesh, Viswanath]|[ur.01361072103.18]|Information Systems Research|2000|11|4|342-365|10.1287/isre.11.4.342.11872|pub.1064711433|3464;[Szajna, Bernadette]|[]|Management Science|1996|42|1|85-92|10.1287/mnsc.42.1.85|pub.1064721432|924;[Venkatesh, Viswanath; Davis, Fred D.]|[ur.01361072103.18; ur.014060724401.60]|Management Science|2000|46|2|186-204|10.1287/mnsc.46.2.186.11926|pub.1064721971|9841;[Mbarika, Victor W.

pub.1004291194,10.1002/itdj.20071,Digital literacy: Problems faced by telecenter users in Mexico,"This article explores the problems that Internet users of marginalized populations face at telecenters (Internet public access sites). Using an exploratory case study method and gathering data from users and telecenter operators, we have explored users' limitations when using the Internet. To interpret the results, this article uses the digital literacy framework developed by Eshet-Alkai (2004). Findings reveal telecenter users are digitally illiterate in three skills: “branching ability” (ability to navigate through a nonlinear environment to find the desired information); “reproduction ability” (ability to analyze and synthesize the information retrieved); and “information ability” (ability to assess the quality of information). Additionally, there are technical barriers, such as Internet access speed, which influence user's behaviors when searching for information. Finally, the lack of knowledge of the English language, which is the predominant languages in the Internet, is a barrier that widens the digital divide. Based on these findings, this research suggests possible solutions to overcome user's problems. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Information Technology for Development,2007,13,3,217-232,"Huerta, Esperanza; Sandoval‐Almazán, Rodrigo",Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México; Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education,Mexico; Mexico,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1004291194,32,"[Kvasny, Lynette; Keil, Mark]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.013136272710.25]|Information Systems Journal|2006|16|1|23-53|10.1111/j.1365-2575.2006.00207.x|pub.1000107294|158;[Barbatsis, Gretchen; Camacho, Melissa; Jackson, Linda]|[ur.01253317563.89; ; ur.01070755763.48]|Visual Studies|2004|19|1|36-51|10.1080/1472586042000204834|pub.1003263818|10;[]|[]|Journal of Environmental Psychology|1992|12|1|97-98|10.1016/s0272-4944(05)80303-2|pub.1003732843|136;[Mariscal, Judith]|[ur.07365701451.47]|Telecommunications Policy|2005|29|5-6|409-428|10.1016/j.telpol.2005.03.004|pub.1015198978|80;[Crano, William D.; Brewer, Marilynn B.; Crano, William D.; Brewer, Marilynn B.; Lac, Andrew]|[; ; ; ; ur.01027500376.18]||2001||||10.4324/9781410613134|pub.1019694857|104;[Paul, Johnson]|[]|Program|2002|36|1|13-22|10.1108/00330330210426085|pub.1020614063|21;[Abbey, Beverly; Smith-Gratto, Karen]|[; ur.010027107243.34]|Instructional and Cognitive Impacts of Web-Based Education|2000|||227-240|10.4018/978-1-878289-59-9.ch015|pub.1025031003|8;[Cullen, Rowena]|[ur.01027321712.95]|Online Information Review|2001|25|5|311-320|10.1108/14684520110410517|pub.1029188033|162;[Dutton, William H; Gillett, Sharon Eisner; McKnight, Lee W; Peltu, Malcolm]|[ur.014650741236.96; ur.014205054675.54; ur.012217645045.27; ur.012471563332.27]|Journal of Information Technology|2004|19|1|28-38|10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000007|pub.1031322946|47;[Shneiderman, Ben]|[ur.013052653253.13]|Interactions|2001|8|2|11-15|10.1145/361897.361905|pub.1033617266|13;[James, Jeffrey]|[ur.07532230071.92]|Journal of Information Technology|2004|19|3|172-177|10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000019|pub.1034378460|27;[]|[]|Journal of Environmental Psychology|1994|14|4|336-337|10.1016/s0272-4944(05)80231-2|pub.1035611009|5643;[Mutch, A.]|[ur.012410736264.80]|International Journal of Information Management|1997|17|5|377-386|10.1016/s0268-4012(97)00017-0|pub.1042968864|48;[LAM, JOLIE C.Y.; LEE, MATTHEW K.O.]|[ur.014013517107.02; ur.013410357334.97]|Journal of Management Information Systems|2006|22|4|177-206|10.2753/mis0742-1222220407|pub.1047015084|120;[O'Neill, Edward T.; Lavoie, Brian F.; Bennett, Rick]|[; ; ]|D-Lib Magazine|2003|9|4||10.1045/april2003-lavoie|pub.1056730674|49;[Alkali, Yoram Eshet; Amichai-Hamburger, Yair]|[; ur.013225150321.95]|Cyberpsychology Behavior and Social Networking|2004|7|4|421-429|10.1089/cpb.2004.7.421|pub.1059246667|136;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]|Info|2003|5|1|77-78|10.1108/146366903322008287|pub.1061015345|74;[James, Jeffrey]|[]|Journal of Information Science|2005|31|2|114-123|10.1177/0165551505050788|pub.1063750985|39;[Aula, Anne; Käki, Mika]|[ur.014550537375.51; ur.013155576375.67]|First Monday|2005||||10.5210/fm.v10i7.1254|pub.1072709253|15;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|First Monday|2002|7|4||10.5210/fm.v7i4.942|pub.1072710742|980;[Davison, Elizabeth; Cotten, Shelia]|[; ur.011516045427.40]|First Monday|2003|8|3||10.5210/fm.v8i3.1039|pub.1072710833|49;[]|[]|Choice|2006|43|09|43-5395-43-5395|10.5860/choice.43-5395|pub.1073409435|119;[Riggins, Frederick; Dewan, Sanjeev]|[; ]|Journal of the Association for Information Systems|2005|6|12|298-337|10.17705/1jais.00074|pub.1100731533|295;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|Journal of the Association for Information Systems|2006|7|1|52-67|10.17705/1jais.00076|pub.1100760197|36;[Benbasat, Izak; Goldstein, David K.; Mead, Melissa]|[ur.0745713632.15; ur.010634400236.08; ur.011431760636.42]|MIS Quarterly|1987|11|3|369|10.2307/248684|pub.1102514750|2241;[Gómez, Ricardo]|[]|Current History|2000|99|634|72-77|10.1525/curh.2000.99.634.72|pub.1127800624|8"

However, by December 2002, only a few thousand homes had adopted the technology. This paper examines the implementation and regulation of digital TV in Australia from the point of view of the ‘established base’ the new technology will replace, theories on diffusion and innovation of new technologies, and the Justification Model, which sees technology choice as social gambling. It then evaluates the various protectionist regulations and limitations imposed on the technology to safeguard the various stakeholders, the implementation strategies used, lack of digital content, marketing efforts, negative media coverage, and the economic realities of the technology, and argues that if consumers reject the technology altogether, it would lead to Australia missing the future applications of digital technology and the opportunity to address the issue of the ‘digital divide’ in the 21st century.",InSITE Conference,2003,,,,"D.

In this paper, we propose a method of providing a voice interface for access to Web pages using a Web browser. Specifically, VoiceXML metadata, which contains an oral interaction scenario, is placed in the Web server along with the associated HTML data. Two alternative methods are considered for the client terminal to acquire this metadata: the built-in address method and the self-acquisition method. We have also developed a method of synchronizing oral interactions with the Web page display. We have built an experimental system, and used it to confirm that the proposed method operates as intended.","International Conference on Mobile Ubiquitous Computing, Systems, Services and Technologies (UBICOMM'07)",2007,,,89-94,"Hayashi, Nobutaka; Takami, Kazumasa",Soka University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094032549,0,"[Takami, Kazumasa; Yamaguchi, Takako; Unno, Kiyoshi]|[ur.016616322521.26; ; ]|2006 First International Conference on Communications and Electronics|2006|||398-401|10.1109/cce.2006.350883|pub.1093955374|3"

It then delineates sectors worth researching, given the influence of globalization and the speed of technological advance. The societal impact of these problem areas cannot be ignored, as they are significant. From the viewpoints of the consumer and society, the decrease in small shops and the concentration of retailing might have negative effects; such as increased unemployment coupled with lower personal service offerings. This article further suggests that policy makers should pay attention to the ‘Digital Divide.’ The technological skills required to work effectively in the ‘Digital Age’ are separating skilled workers from others. It may not be possible to retrain significant numbers of other workers for many of the ‘new economy’ professions.

However, the “digital divide” is increasing rather than diminishing existing inequalities. This paper suggests several ways in which experiences with ICTs can be shared and in which more resources could be mobilised to support local ICT projects and locally‐defined goals. The activities of the Commonwealth’s agencies in this area are used to provide illustrations of a variety of initiatives. It is argued that strategic action on the part of agencies within their own organisations and in co‐operation with others is likely to help to facilitate the process of constructing a stronger knowledge base for knowledge‐driven development, but that there is no room for complacency. In addition to improved co‐ordination and co‐operation, effort is needed to focus on the purposes and goals of knowledge‐driven development, rather than on the short‐term interests of individual stakeholder organisations.",Journal of Knowledge Management,2002,6,4,317-329,"Mansell, Robin",London School of Economics and Political Science,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027872970,31,"[UNDP]|[]|Human Development Report|1999|||57-76|10.18356/7c56eb17-en|pub.1090069694|5;[Mansell, Robin]|[]||2002||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198296553.001.0001|pub.1098732077|45;[Heeks, Richard]|[ur.01241047651.15]|SSRN Electronic Journal|1998||||10.2139/ssrn.3540073|pub.1125711327|15"

CzRM promises higher service quality at lower costs. CzRM was originally a private sector business strategy, part of the “entrepreneurial” paradigm that was applied to the public sector in the mid-1990s. This paper deals with four concerns: the assertion that transformation of citizens into customers has damaging effects on democratic governance and public administration; the existence of digital divides; accountability-issues; and the role of consultants as intermediaries. Finally, the change in citizens’ wants and views about government may be caused by more fundamental changes happening in the American society. Despite the mentioned concerns, CzRM is feasible, but it should occur with an awareness of the raison d’être of the public sector, and that government has a role in securing both the quality and equality of government services.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2005,3591,,57-68,"Larsen, Bettina; Milakovich, Michael",University of Miami,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021213221,15,"[Grönlund, Tuulikki; Kauppila, Tommi]|[ur.014407001715.80; ur.012253644401.28]|Boreas|2002|31|3|273-284|10.1080/030094802760260382|pub.1058316241|7;[]|[]|GSA Today|2004|14|4|12|10.1130/1052-5173(2004)014<0012:natgb>2.0.co;2|pub.1062732412|1;[HOLDEN, STEPHEN H.; NORRIS, DONALD F.; FLETCHER, PATRICIA D.]|[; ; ]|Public Performance & Management Review|2003|26|4|325-344|10.1177/1530957603026004002|pub.1064035451|197"

pub.1064714371,10.1287/mnsc.1040.0343,The Corporate Digital Divide: Determinants of Internet Adoption,"The diffusion of Internet technology among firms is widely considered to be one of the primary factors behind the rapid economic growth of the 1990s. However, little systematic study has examined the variation in firm decisions to adopt the Internet. I explore the sources of this variation by examining Internet adoption decisions in a very large sample of organizations in the finance and services sector in 1998. I show how prior information technology (IT) investments and workplace organization decisions affect the returns to adopting simple and complex Internet technologies. I show that recent investments in client/server (C/S) networking applications have competing effects on the likelihood of Internet adoption. Such investments can slow adoption by acting as a short-run substitute or by creating “switching costs.” Geographic dispersion of employees is complementary with Internet adoption, suggesting that Internet technology lowered internal coordination costs. Increases in organization size and external pressure also increase the likelihood of adoption.",Management Science,2005,51,4,641-654,"Forman, Chris",Carnegie Mellon University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1064714371,155,"[Bresnahan, Timothy F.; Trajtenberg, M.]|[ur.013306211413.20; ur.016622504767.96]|Journal of Econometrics|1995|65|1|83-108|10.1016/0304-4076(94)01598-t|pub.1015878906|1288;[Tan, Margaret; Teo, Thompson S.H.]|[ur.012352326603.61; ur.014043136677.02]|International Journal of Electronic Commerce|1998|2|3|5-18|10.1080/10864415.1998.11518312|pub.1018756826|70;[Irwin, Douglas A.; Klenow, Peter J.]|[ur.07373476567.10; ur.010423026174.84]|Journal of Political Economy|1994|102|6|1200-1227|10.1086/261968|pub.1058575449|363;[Goolsbee, Austan; Klenow, Peter J.]|[ur.014677654741.57; ur.010423026174.84]|The Journal of Law and Economics|2002|45|2|317-343|10.1086/344399|pub.1058640424|226;[Tornatzky, L.

Specifically, the proposed fusion environment realizes a unified infrastructure that changes traditional, passive urban users into active, information society participants capable of creating, manipulating, and distributing their own content/services over a commonly exploited infrastructure. Further, the environment enables triple-play services and always-on connectivity in rural areas, that is, in regions where there is no termination of the core backbone to the local PSTN/ISDN exchanger. Finally, the article describes important directions for future research to follow to exploit the proposed IP/DVB unified platform for the synergy of emerging broadcasting, telecommunications, wireless, and wired technologies, to alleviate the digital divide that currently exists not only among countries but also within most countries",IEEE Network,2007,21,2,21-27,"Mastorakis, G.; Kormentzas, G.; Pallis, E.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1061411540,18,"[Kouis, Dimitris; Loukatos, Dimitris; Kontovasilis, Kimon; Kormentzas, George; Skianis, Charalabos]|[ur.011242152251.38; ; ur.015713070763.18; ur.016342371332.32; ur.016030265777.32]|Computer Networks|2005|48|1|57-73|10.1016/j.comnet.2004.10.008|pub.1005642361|11;[Skianis, C.; Kormentzas, G.; Kontovasilis, K.]|[ur.016030265777.32; ur.016342371332.32; ur.015713070763.18]|Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing|2005|5|6|679-695|10.1002/wcm.334|pub.1026723829|19;[Pallis, Evangelos; Mantakas, Charalambos; Mastorakis, George; Kourtis, Anastasios; Zacharopoulos, Vassilios]|[ur.016344123075.91; ur.07523064365.69; ur.015557346701.99; ur.012616503623.96; ur.014115101142.22]|European Transactions on Telecommunications|2006|17|2|175-182|10.1002/ett.1099|pub.1052971685|18;[CALYAM, PRASAD; LEE, CHANG-GUN]|[ur.0612120307.38; ur.015313577023.88]|New Trends in Computer Networks|2005|||83-92|10.1142/9781860947308_0009|pub.1096050862|23"

An important and widely used component of online courses are online forums. Forums encourage interaction between students (who may never meet face-to-face) and are a vital part of the virtual classroom experience. Literature suggests that distance learners require a great deal of interaction to overcome the feeling of isolation; the development of a virtual world (classroom) encourages students to participate in the learning process by exploring and playing with course materials; and promotes interactions between students and teachers that may not occur in a traditional classroom. In order to conduct a successful online forum it is necessary to have a collection of provocative discussion topics and a sound technique to implement them.

The research focuses on the divide patterns of four different types of political Internet use: information-seeking, communication, mobilization, and use of social networking sites. The research results suggest a higher likelihood for the socioeconomically advantaged to do online political activities. A generational gap is less apparent with regard to communication than information-seeking and mobilization. The sociodemographic pattern of the democratic divide overall resembles that of Internet access divide, but the political divide manifested by education and income is being bridged to some extent among current users of social networking sites. Although younger generations were more likely to use social networking sites for political activities, such use did not significantly raise the probability to cast a ballot in the 2008 presidential election.",Journal of Information Technology & Politics,2011,9,2,133-149,"Nam, Taewoo; Stromer-Galley, Jennifer",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027927782,9,"[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|Sociological Inquiry|2010|80|1|92-113|10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x|pub.1001393372|816;[Dhavan V.

pub.1013101344,10.1007/11823100_7,The Citizens in E-Participation,"Recent advances in GIS and the Internet have improved the technical possibilities for supporting the public participation through e-Participation systems – e.g. Public Participation GIS. On the other hand there has been too much focus on many technical aspects of public participation with reduced focus on the citizens. Equal opportunities to express their opinions and an open debate between people are the basic foundation for democracy. Therefore the design of participatory processes must take outset in the citizens and their knowledge and commitment concerning the issue to be debated. The current paper presents the results of a survey among actively involved citizens in Northern Jutland County. Our analysis shows a high degree of involvement among middle-age well-educated males with a higher education and income above average. It seems that contrary to the planner’s vision of an open debate among all citizens, the result of a PPGIS service is a debate among a rather limited group.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2006,4084,,70-82,"Hansen, Henning Sten; Reinau, Kristian Hegner",Aalborg University,Denmark,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013101344,35,"[Mitchell, Ronald K.; Agle, Bradley R.; Wood, Donna J.]|[ur.015236276245.26; ur.014055437405.09; ur.010031214476.63]|Academy of Management Review|1997|22|4|853|10.2307/259247|pub.1000126868|4899;[Hansen, Henning Sten; Prosperi, David C.]|[ur.010026773613.15; ur.013716376127.38]|Computers Environment and Urban Systems|2005|29|6|617-629|10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2005.07.001|pub.1029894671|26;[Jackson, Laurie Skuba]|[ur.014317213523.05]|Local Environment|2001|6|2|135-147|10.1080/13549830120052782|pub.1037921810|42;[Wiedemann, Peter M.; Femers, Susanne]|[ur.012172442302.37; ]|Journal of Hazardous Materials|1993|33|3|355-368|10.1016/0304-3894(93)85085-s|pub.1039530634|111;[Arnstein, Sherry R.]|[ur.014040164114.87]|Journal of the American Planning Association|1969|35|4|216-224|10.1080/01944366908977225|pub.1052040552|7757"

The conceptual framework is that social and economic dimensions impact the sizes of technology sectors in counties, i.e. technology does not develop by itself but in concert with pre-disposing characteristics of the environment. Based on correlation and regression analyses, the findings reveal that nationally in the US, factors that are important correlates of technology sectors are professional/scientific/technical services workforce, other services workforce, household income, federal grant funds, college education, and ethnicity. The study reveals a large range in technology levels across the nation. There are distinctive influences for counties in “sunbelt” versus “traditional” subsamples, and in “high-tech” versus “low-tech” subsamples. The findings are discussed in terms of relevant academic and policy literature. The paper implies that certain “indirect” steps can be taken by national, state, and local governments to reduce the digital divide.",International Journal of Information Management,2005,25,1,21-37,"Azari, Rasool; Pick, James B.",University of Redlands,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007594988,30,"[Stein, Johan R.]|[]|International Journal of Social Economics|1995|22|6|38-52|10.1108/03068299510091197|pub.1019628267|1;[Glaeser, Edward L.; Scheinkman, JoséA.; Shleifer, Andrei]|[ur.01200266314.16; ; ur.013654042527.10]|Journal of Monetary Economics|1995|36|1|117-143|10.1016/0304-3932(95)01206-2|pub.1023534990|668;[Light, Jennifer]|[]|Harvard Educational Review|2001|71|4|709-734|10.17763/haer.71.4.342x36742j2w4q82|pub.1048973950|67;[Landau, Ralph]|[]|Scientific American|1988|258|6|44-52|10.1038/scientificamerican0688-44|pub.1056556640|12;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]|Info|2003|5|1|77-78|10.1108/146366903322008287|pub.1061015345|74;[]|[]|Education + Training|2001|43|2||10.1108/et.2001.00443bad.003|pub.1061040517|4;[Autor, David H.; Katz, Lawrence F.; Krueger, Alan B.]|[ur.011241342041.35; ur.01165352155.05; ur.0655705467.19]|The Quarterly Journal of Economics|1998|113|4|1169-1213|10.1162/003355398555874|pub.1063349115|1171;[Glaeser, Edward L]|[ur.01200266314.16]|Journal of Economic Perspectives|1998|12|2|139-160|10.1257/jep.12.2.139|pub.1064529907|423;[Slowinski, Joseph]|[]|First Monday|2000|5|7||10.5210/fm.v5i7.773|pub.1072710587|4;[Baker, Paul M.A.]|[]|First Monday|2001|6|5||10.5210/fm.v6i5.860|pub.1072710664|11;[]|[]|Choice|1997|34|06|34-3414-34-3414|10.5860/choice.34-3414|pub.1073341840|803;[Florida, Richard; Gates, Gary]|[; ]|Research in Urban Policy|2003|Volume 9|Issue rup/2003/s1479-3520(2003)9/s1479-3520(2003)9/production|199-219|10.1016/s1479-3520(03)09007-x|pub.1084807116|69;[James, Jeffrey]|[]||2003||||10.4337/9781843767169|pub.1091408226|37;[]|[]||2002||||10.4018/978-1-93070-811-2|pub.1096031362|11;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]||2001||||10.1017/cbo9781139164887|pub.1098663486|2054;[Rosenberg, Nathan]|[]||1994||||10.1017/cbo9780511582554|pub.1098705309|712;[Mathews, Jessica T.]|[]|Foreign Policy|2000||119|63|10.2307/1149529|pub.1102459679|4;[Crandall, Robert W.]|[]|The Brookings Review|2001|19|1|38|10.2307/20080960|pub.1102604275|4"

The financial crisis has caused many to question the basic premises of the current business system. In the following chapter, I will examine how organizations can cope with the current crisis by creating sustainable value. I propose that businesses learn from a newly emerging field called social entrepreneurship. The concept of social entrepreneurship is discussed and examined for its potential to support for sustainable value creation. A detailed case study of bracNet provides an example of shared-value creation. bracNet is a for-profit enterprise in Bangladesh aiming to close the digital divide globally and regionally. New business models and cross-sectoral partnerships allow bracNet to implement a social and financial value creation strategy. Key for success seems to be the shared ownership of bracNet, by BRAC, a nonprofit organization, and various for-profit entities (including VCs, industrial conglomerates, and hedge funds).",Advances in Appreciative Inquiry,2010,,,259-274,"Pirson, Michael",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007399335,5,"[Austin, James E.]|[ur.014246770173.23]|Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|2000|29|1_suppl|69-97|10.1177/0899764000291s004|pub.1003916581|350;[Figge, Frank; Hahn, Tobias]|[ur.07462211653.35; ur.011550427277.32]|Ecological Economics|2004|48|2|173-187|10.1016/j.ecolecon.2003.08.005|pub.1017121280|345;[Dart, Raymond]|[ur.015603135337.42]|Nonprofit Management and Leadership|2004|14|4|411-424|10.1002/nml.43|pub.1026026695|658;[Diener, Ed; Seligman, Martin E.P.]|[ur.0657322001.95; ur.0767647771.53]|Psychological Science in the Public Interest|2004|5|1|1-31|10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00501001.x|pub.1044013053|1521;[]|[]|International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management|2005|54|2||10.1108/ijppm.2005.07954bae.003|pub.1061047532|616;[Etzioni, Amitai]|[]|Public Administration Review|1973|33|4|314|10.2307/975110|pub.1070710049|122;[]|[]|Choice|2004|42|03|42-1664-42-1664|10.5860/choice.42-1664|pub.1073398157|21;[Porter, Michael E; Kramer, Mark R]|[ur.01351562110.76; ur.01324607560.37]|Harvard Business Review|2006|84|12|78-92, 163||pub.1077340299|4288"
pub.1094546090,10.1109/hicss.2005.7,A Cost-Benefit Analysis of the Seoul Open System: Policy Lessons for Electronic Government Projects,"This paper uses a case study to illustrate how political bias in cost-benefit analysis (CBA) affected an electronic government project, the OPEN System, in Seoul, Korea. A conceptual cost-benefit framework is developed to comprehensively assess the costs and benefits categories associated with electronic government projects, and to compare it against the politically biased analysis. CBA depends largely upon analysts' view on the costs and benefits of a project. Most electronic government projects are analyzed by the politicians' view, which can depart from the normative assumptions of standard CBA to reflect the viewpoints of affected key constituencies. This biased view tends to inflate benefits and to underestimate costs by ignoring major costs. By comparing the two CBAs with different viewpoints, I am able to show how politicians' lens erroneously analyzes electronic government projects, overlooking key issues, such as security, privacy, and equity (digital divide).",Proceedings of the 38th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,2005,,,1-9,"Park, Hun Myoung",Indiana University Bloomington,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094546090,1,"[Boardman, Anthony; Vining, Aidan; Waters, W.

Data were collected using questionnaire and interviews of 170 retailers and 73 customers selected in Harare. Zimbabwe's retail sector lags behind in e-business adoption. Key e-commerce applications were in administration, accounting, management and control systems with barcode-driven systems and debit card swipe technologies being most common. Mismatch between the demand for e-business solutions by customers and the supply of such solutions by retailers and a pronounced digital divide between multiple store and single store retailers in the areas of network technologies were identified. The impact of e-business on business processes and company productivity is positive for multiple store and minimal for single store operators. Internal work organisation, procurement costs of supply goods and quality of product and services impacts are minimal.

Unlike in enterprise environments, however, householders often do not plan or manage for network growth. As a result, devices are often added in a haphazard, piecemeal manner [1]. The open-ended nature of home networking protocols has also led to highly dynamic and heterogeneous home networks. The range of possible devices and possible ways to configure and connect those devices—means that every network likely looks different; one study suggests that highly customized, end-user configured home networks are the norm in many households today [2]. Given the complexity of digital devices, the presence of highly-customized networks, and the technical inexperience of many people, how well do householders understand the structure and function of their home networks?

This article concludes with a discussion of how examining these policy issues can lead to a better understanding of public libraries and the Internet access they offer within the context of public policy.",Government Information Quarterly,2006,23,1,123-141,"Jaeger, Paul T.; Bertot, John Carlo; McClure, Charles R.; Langa, Lesley A.",Florida State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040760903,17,"[Jaeger, Paul T.; Bertot, John Carlo; McClure, Charles R.]|[ur.011542112017.14; ur.011253735727.32; ur.011622741644.06]|Government Information Quarterly|2003|20|3|295-314|10.1016/s0740-624x(03)00057-1|pub.1000824619|26;[Hashim, Elinor M.]|[]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|1985|36|6|360-363|10.1002/asi.4630360603|pub.1006601263|23;[Bertot, John Carlo; McClure, Charles R]|[ur.011253735727.32; ur.011622741644.06]|Library & Information Science Research|1999|21|3|281-298|10.1016/s0740-8188(99)00014-6|pub.1006794270|9;[Jaeger, Paul T; Thompson, Kim M]|[ur.011542112017.14; ur.014776367265.07]|Government Information Quarterly|2003|20|4|389-394|10.1016/j.giq.2003.08.001|pub.1009664461|269;[Jaeger, Paul T.]|[ur.011542112017.14]|Government Information Quarterly|2005|22|4|702-719|10.1016/j.giq.2006.01.012|pub.1019221876|91;[Jaeger, Paul T]|[ur.011542112017.14]|Government Information Quarterly|2003|20|4|323-331|10.1016/j.giq.2003.08.003|pub.1028111072|240;[Jaeger, Paul T.; Thompson, Kim M.]|[ur.011542112017.14; ur.014776367265.07]|Library & Information Science Research|2004|26|1|94-107|10.1016/j.lisr.2003.11.006|pub.1037011793|123;[Aldrich, Duncan; Bertot, John Carlo; McClure, Charles R]|[; ur.011253735727.32; ur.011622741644.06]|Government Information Quarterly|2002|19|4|349-355|10.1016/s0740-624x(02)00130-2|pub.1038662772|71;[Jaeger, Paul T.; Bertot, John Carlo; McClure, Charles R.]|[ur.011542112017.14; ur.011253735727.32; ur.011622741644.06]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2004|55|13|1131-1139|10.1002/asi.20072|pub.1038761458|19;[Jaeger, Paul T.; McClure, Charles R.; Bertot, John Carlo; Snead, John T.]|[ur.011542112017.14; ur.011622741644.06; ur.011253735727.32; ur.016534454355.73]|The Library Quarterly|2004|74|2|99-121|10.1086/382843|pub.1058674311|18;[Jaeger, Paul T.; Burnett, Gary]|[; ]|The Library Quarterly|2005|75|4|464-495|10.1086/502787|pub.1058783618|43;[Taylor, Mayo; Black, William]|[; ]|Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|2004|36|2|51-54|10.1177/0961000604046280|pub.1063902266|1;[Birdsall, Stephanie]|[]|First Monday|2005||||10.5210/fm.v10i4.1216|pub.1072709225|4;[Jaeger, Paul; McClure, Charles]|[; ]|First Monday|2004|9|2||10.5210/fm.v9i2.1117|pub.1072710904|5;[Jaeger, Paul T.; McClure, Charles R.; Bertot, John Carlo]|[ur.011542112017.14; ur.011622741644.06; ur.011253735727.32]|Information Technology and Libraries|2005|24|2|57|10.6017/ital.v24i2.3366|pub.1073587608|20;[Jiao, Qun G.; Onwuegbuzie, Anthony J.]|[ur.01310751033.22; ur.01102371270.52]|Information Technology and Libraries|2017|23|4|138-144|10.6017/ital.v23i4.9655|pub.1091857403|24;[]|[]||2000||||10.4018/978-1-878289-66-7|pub.1096031361|20;[Bleha, Thomas]|[]|FOREIGN AFFAIRS|2005|84|3|111|10.2307/20034354|pub.1102752109|16"

The mission of the program is to network these professionals with the university’s knowledge production centers for the profit both of ’digital inclusion agents’ (advanced training and consulting with the academic community) and academicians doing research on new forms of knowledge production leveraged by information and communication technologies (ICTs). Network development is moderated by Brazil’s largest public university focusing on project design and knowledge management. Networked projects must be oriented to problem-solving in underserved communities, mostly in the periphery of the city of São Paulo. The main goal of the program is to forge lifelong learning communities through networking that leverage development and social projects, putting information and communication technologies to a collaborative use.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2005,3081,,407-416,"Balboni, Mariana Reis; Schwartz, Gilson",Universidade de São Paulo,Brazil,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038800146,1,"[]|[]|The Virtual Community|2000||||10.7551/mitpress/7105.001.0001|pub.1110624761|806;[Compaine, Benjamin M.]|[]|The Digital Divide|2001||||10.7551/mitpress/2419.001.0001|pub.1110922707|242"

Its scope covers every election or decision-making process, which takes place through voting. Due mainly to the digital divide and to current technological limitation, electronic voting cannot be proposed as a universal means of voting but rather as an alternative option, supplemental to traditional voting means. An electronic voting process must be designed in such a way as to guarantee the general, free, equal and secret character of elections. In a democratic context an electronic voting system should respect and ensure attributes and properties such as transparency, verifiability, accountability, security and accuracy. Only then can it foster and promote the participation of the citizens, the legitimacy and the democratic transaction of the election process.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2002,86,,469-480,"Mitrou, Lilian; Gritzalis, Dimitris; Katsikas, Sokratis",University of the Aegean; Athens University of Economics and Business,Greece; Greece,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038157299,39,"[Mercuri, Rebecca]|[ur.016470074133.75]|Communications of the ACM|2000|43|11|176|10.1145/353360.353378|pub.1010501377|5;[Hoffman, Lance J.; Cranor, Lorrie]|[ur.01143473600.97; ur.012313770727.30]|Communications of the ACM|2001|44|1|69-71|10.1145/357489.357510|pub.1036708056|15;[Phillips, Deborah M.; von Spakovsky, Hans A.]|[; ]|Communications of the ACM|2001|44|1|73-ff.|10.1145/357489.357512|pub.1045705328|28;[Butler, R.; Welch, V.; Engert, D.; Foster, I.; Tuecke, S.; Volmer, J.; Kesselman, C.]|[ur.0635530224.37; ur.016532216777.55; ; ur.0634177304.42; ur.07350736171.00; ; ur.01022504670.00]|Computer|2000|33|12|60-66|10.1109/2.889094|pub.1061106331|186"
pub.1004324311,10.4018/jicthd.2010070101,Adoption and Use of ICTs among Rural Youth: Evidence from Greece,"In the last few decades, within the rhetoric of the “information age”, there is a growing enthusiasm for the (potential) benefits of the dissemination of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). This is further enhanced through eGovernment projects undertaken on a worldwide scale. However, a number of issues seem to defy such optimism as far as rural areas are concerned. The critical review of such issues question the thesis that ICTs undoubtedly benefit (human) development. In particular, this paper, drawing on data from a large-scale survey in Greece, identifies the marginal effects of a series of demographic, socioeconomic and spatial characteristics, and information sources on PC and Internet use on the part of young rural inhabitants, especially farmers. The results, pointing toward an emerging intra-rural digital divide, are consequently discussed vis-à-vis eGovernment projects, from the point of view of human development.",International Journal of Information Communication Technologies and Human Development,2010,2,3,1-18,"Alexopoulos, George; Koutsouris, Alex; Tzouramani, Irene",Agricultural University of Athens; National Agricultural Research Foundation,Greece; Greece,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1004324311,4,"[Gil-Garcia, J.

I began this essay after an energizing meeting with a bright young scholar on starting a new journal for africaresource.com . The journal, we agreed, would address the knowledge concerns of a politically conscious generation engaged in transformatory critical scholarship. Its distinguishing feature would be the New Afrikan perspective that would offer radical readings of texts and cultural phenomena. Just as our discussion drew to a close the critical question came: So what exactly does africaresource.com stand for?

Papers in this minitrack address how public policies, laws and governance are related to the use and development of information and communication technologies (ICT) both in government and in society at large. Government policies and legislation can create the technological environment and the necessary boundaries for e-government and e-democracy applications and services. At the organizational level, this includes aspects of equal access rights, privacy protection, public safety, security, and information dissemination. In the context of government information systems and at the infrastructure level, it encompasses the introduction of national ID cards, central citizen registries, data centers, public key infrastructure and Internet-based infrastructure.

The motivation for launching this new symposium is to promote the exchange of knowledge on the technical, policy, and social issues implicit in the development of national and international information infrastructures. These issues have been traditionally addressed in separate events although intricately related. By bringing together these interrelated issues, GIIS aims at stimulating interdisciplinary symposium sessions and workshops to discuss, built and further the use of local, regional and global information infrastructures. The symposium theme “closing the digital divide” reflects another primary motivation behind the launch of GIIS that is to promote the development of information infrastructures in underserved regions such as rural areas and developing countries.

With the commercialization of CDMA 2000–1x late in 2000, a high-speed wireless Internet, based on a mobile communication network, appeared in Korea. This will develop into the next-generation of mobile communications(4G) with faster transmission of increased volumes of data in the future. The new cell layout requires the cellular configuration of 4G and the 4G services have to more offer a universal service of mobile communication and to more reduce a digital divide. We would need the legislation with respect to base station and to building the mobile communication networks, as well as the optimization of mobile communication systems. In this study, in order to provide 4G, I examined and analyzed that the current laws related to licensing and operating a mobile communication base station in KOREA.","Proceedings of 2004 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems, 2004.

In this article, a methodology is presented to extract the indicators that attempt to appropriately measure the information society and serve as the basis and standard for internationally comparable information society statistics. These indicators, which are called core indicators of the information society, are extracted by studying and analyzing 39 reputable information society and digital divide models and using content analysis, entropy method, Scree test, and Pareto analysis. The proposed methodology is developed as a reaction against the limitation of the non-existence of numerical values for some indicators in the majority of countries. Finally, comparing the global core indicators of the information society and the proposed ones, it reveals that the global core indicators of the information society have ignored two important dimensions: e-learning and networked world enablers.",Journal of Information Technology Research,2009,2,3,71-95,"Hanafizadeh, P.; Khodabakhshi, M.; Hanafizadeh, M.

Results from observations and interviews within the research project InnoMat are presented to answer the question how self-efficacy influences the ticket buying behavior and show that this motivational factor leads to an active avoidance of ticket machines.

The survey has revealed the geographical distribution of server sites as well as their connection environments. It has been found that the percentage of offshore (out of home country) servers is as high as 80% and more than half of these are located in Europe. Offshore servers not only provide little benefit to the people of the country to which each ccTLD rightly belongs but their existence also heightens the risk of a country being unable to control them with its own policies and regulations.

Web services provides a new way of standard-based software technology, letting programmers combine existing computer system in new ways over the Internet within one business or across many, and would thereby bring about profound and far-reaching impacts on e-government. This paper introduced the business modes of e-government, architecture of dynamic e-government and its key technologies.

To resolve this problem, we proposed the life support system which is called “e-house”, using an information network technology. Since the information infrastructure was different according to the living environment of the elderly, we had to develop the method to cancell the digital divide. We constructed the home network system which adopted a power-line network. The result of the experiment of communication using power-line network shows the power-line network has enough band width to transfer the biomedical signals like an ECG. In addition, we developed the WWW based tele-monitoring system for the elderly. As the result of experiments, we confirmed that this Web-based monitoring system is effective for the tele-monitoring of the health condition of the elderly.",Journal of Life Support Engineering,2001,13,4,112,"NAMBU, Masayuki; SUENAGA, Takatoshi; ICHINOSEKI, Noriko; NAKAJIMA, Kazuki; TAMURA, Toshiyo",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014118575,1,

The ‘Demand-Side’ of e-Government in Australia and New Zealand,"Drawing on 435 telephone interviews in Australia and 498 in New Zealand, this paper investigates the ‘demand’ side of e-government. That is, we examine the use of and support for e-government measures. Whilst respondents were generally supportive of e-government on a number of measures, we find that the majority were reluctant to use some of the more sophisticated ‘transactional’ e-government measures, and less than half had even visited a government website. High users of information and communications technologies (ICT) were more likely to use e-government measures, and are more positive towards e-government in general across several measures. Similar to a number of U.S. studies, we find a ‘digital divide,’ where older age, and less education were associated with lower ICT and e-government use and support. Income level was not a statistically significant predictor in all cases however, and gender was not significant for e-government support.",Government Information Quarterly,2010,27,2,177-186,"Gauld, Robin; Goldfinch, Shaun; Horsburgh, Simon",University of Otago; University of Nottingham,New Zealand; United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014000326,150,"[Kolsaker, Ailsa; Lee‐Kelley, Liz]|[ur.016622131027.01; ur.014047374707.20]|International Journal of Public Sector Management|2008|21|7|723-738|10.1108/09513550810904532|pub.1002239686|105;[Gauld, Robin]|[]|International Handbook of Public Management Reform|2009||||10.4337/9781849802031.00013|pub.1005019229|6;[Coursey, David; Norris, Donald F.]|[ur.012630511431.13; ur.012356021140.87]|Public Administration Review|2008|68|3|523-536|10.1111/j.1540-6210.2008.00888.x|pub.1005974432|348;[Helbig, Natalie; Gil-García, J.

Second, individualism, liberalism and citizen globalization concept prevail in network era, which makes the state traditional political authorization lowered and citizen e-participation may confront with the situation of being out of control. Third, the phenomena of information explosion, information crowd and “group polarization” lead to irrationalism, extremeness of citizen’s political participation on Internet, which will do harm to democratization course of Chinese e-participation. Aimed at these problems, first, China’s government should devote itself to eliminating “digital gap” and accelerating construction of information infrastructure and prevalence of computer network knowledge to supply opportunity of equal network political participation to citizens. Second, China’s government should rule Internet with law and strengthen control and management for network information node, purify information network space, perfect the systems of issuance of government information on Internet, direct communication between government officials and public on Internet to strive to form good “appeal-response” mechanism of interaction between officials and citizens.

Rural Indian population is not as fortune as the urban population in terms of access to quality education system (technical education) and information & communication technology infrastructure of cities. The Information Technology (IT) Giant India needs to take its development programs of education, health, technology, agriculture to the masses to eliminate disparities, specifically the digital divide. India has an excellent education system of more than 380 universities and 1265 engineering colleges [4] providing IT education in the country. Despite this the availability of trained manpower is in short supply as far as IT manpower is concerned. As projected in many reports India could face a shortage of 0.5 million skilled IT manpower by 2009. These statistics are indicative of the fact that there is a need of other alternatives to reduce the digital divide (Rural V/s Urban) in the country and also to fill the gap of shortage of IT trained manpower. In such a scenario e-Learning could play a vital role since its enabler, IT infrastructure is developing in India at a very fast pace as it is evident with the development of Business Process Outsourcing industry and number of telephone users in the country. The President of India in his address (4                     th                     August, 2004) to the children of the nation said “education is the catalyst of change” and ‘Information Technology is the major driving force and change agent”. To achieve the objective of providing education to all children, he announced the project “EDUSAT”, which would install 150,000 ground terminals in the country. In addition new initiative of e-Government policies of the government are encouraging the usage of information technology in all sectors of the economy including education. In the nutshell, India has a conducive environment where e-Learning could develop in future to solve many problems of education especially in rural India.

The rapid growth in the numbers of organizations and people using computers, combined with global connectivity, brought with it many new information technology management challenges. Most organizations in the world now depend on information technology, and that dependency will only increase in the future. The chapter emphasizes that exercising greater social responsibility can help control the potential negative impact of information technology on society and help organizations avoid the many potential liabilities that are emerging as people move further into the digital age. The ten principles of socially responsible information technology management are—appropriately staffing information technology (IT) departments, fairly compensating IT workers, adequately training computer users, providing ergonomic user environments, maintaining secure and virus-flee computer systems, safeguarding the privacy of information, ethically managing intellectual property, utilizing energy-efficient technology, properly recycling used computer equipment, and supporting efforts to reduce the digital divide. These ten principles are elucidated in this chapter in detail.",Socially Responsible IT Management,2003,,,1-13,"Erbschloe, Michael",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034481793,2,
pub.1027767223,10.4067/s0718-18762010000100003,The relationship between human resources and information and communication technologies: Spanish firm-level evidence,"Increased attention to the economic impact of information and communication technologies (ICT) underscores the impact of ICT on the social side of the ""digital divide"". ICT and individual and organizational changes are often closely related. This paper examines the main characteristics of the relationship between ICT and human resources in Spanish firms, in the context of a developed country with an incidence-rate of ICT slightly below the average of its area. The data on 1,269 Spanish manufacturing firms has been taken from the Survey of Business Strategies (SBS) of the Fundacin Empresa Pblica (Spanish Foundation) of Spain. Our results suggest that ICT are related to higher levels of qualification, higher levels of R&D workers, and higher levels of training per worker. Moreover, firms that invest in ICT offer higher levels of average wages. These results confirm the relationship between technological innovation, and organizational and human changes. Managers and public administrators should take into account such mutual interrelations in order to optimize their decisions concerning investment in human and technological resources.",Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research,2010,5,1,11-24,"Galve-Grriz, Carmen; Castel, Ana Gargallo",University of Zaragoza,Spain,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027767223,12,"[Borghans, Lex; Weel, Bas]|[ur.010675153065.40; ur.011530641415.70]|The Economic Journal|2006|116|509|f45-f72|10.1111/j.1468-0297.2006.01064.x|pub.1001324025|37;[Borghans, Lex; Weel, Bas ter]|[ur.010675153065.40; ur.011530641415.70]|Applied Economics|2011|43|29|4607-4622|10.1080/00036846.2010.493138|pub.1001955597|5;[Borghans, Lex; Weel, Bas ter]|[ur.010675153065.40; ur.011530641415.70]|European Economic Review|2007|51|3|715-748|10.1016/j.euroecorev.2006.06.001|pub.1005293449|20;[Battisti, Giuliana; Hollenstein, Heinz; Stoneman, Paul; Woerter, Martin]|[ur.01265607720.18; ur.01035427057.42; ur.016130541121.49; ur.015514221775.91]|Economics of Innovation and New Technology|2007|16|8|669-687|10.1080/10438590600984026|pub.1007439573|40;[Hargadon, Andrew]|[]|Strategy & Leadership|2005|33|1|32-36|10.1108/10878570510572635|pub.1008615057|30;[Arabsheibani, G.R.; Emami, J.M.; Marin, A.]|[ur.010325175555.95; ; ur.011614121173.96]|Scottish Journal of Political Economy|2004|51|1|82-94|10.1111/j.0036-9292.2004.05101005.x|pub.1009660244|22;[Cozzarin, Brian P.; Percival, Jennifer C.]|[ur.011261734726.53; ur.01012506332.02]|Economics of Innovation and New Technology|2006|15|3|195-217|10.1080/10438590500222691|pub.1010596577|56;[Katrak, Homi]|[ur.013540634777.59]|World Development|1997|25|9|1541-1550|10.1016/s0305-750x(97)00051-x|pub.1010636189|16;[Hussain, Zahid; Wallace, James; Cornelius, Nelarine E.]|[ur.012552071561.70; ur.01336044712.02; ur.07620542115.54]|Information & Management|2007|44|1|74-89|10.1016/j.im.2006.10.006|pub.1010838863|113;[Andersen, Torben J.; Segars, Albert H.]|[ur.012630036050.01; ur.010434535433.41]|Information & Management|2001|39|2|85-100|10.1016/s0378-7206(01)00081-7|pub.1010898676|58;[Vinding, Anker Lund]|[ur.01203036171.59]|Economics of Innovation and New Technology|2006|15|4-5|507-517|10.1080/10438590500513057|pub.1013297041|256;[Al-Gahtani, Said S.]|[ur.013611345077.52]|Journal of Global Information Technology Management|2004|7|1|5-29|10.1080/1097198x.2004.10856364|pub.1014166091|54;[Milgrom, Paul; Roberts, John]|[ur.01276737470.97; ur.013604632361.38]|Journal of Accounting and Economics|1995|19|2-3|179-208|10.1016/0165-4101(94)00382-f|pub.1014326307|1599;[Berndt, Ernst R.; Morrison, Catherine J.]|[ur.01254330773.38; ur.013223366065.44]|Journal of Econometrics|1995|65|1|9-43|10.1016/0304-4076(94)01596-r|pub.1017085193|168;[Falk, Martin; Seim, Katja]|[ur.014202507361.46; ur.015035160045.95]|International Journal of Manpower|2001|22|1/2|98-121|10.1108/01437720110386421|pub.1018938859|12;[Arvanitis, Spyros; Hollenstein, Heinz]|[ur.016551152433.12; ur.01035427057.42]|Economics of Innovation and New Technology|2001|10|5|377-414|10.1080/10438590100000015|pub.1021138322|64;[Landry, Brett J.L.; Mahesh, Sathi; Hartman, Sandra]|[ur.015733372571.05; ur.0603305651.04; ur.013407026773.40]|Journal of Organizational Change Management|2005|18|2|132-144|10.1108/09534810510589561|pub.1026427155|15;[Hoskins, Martin]|[]|Economics Letters|2000|69|1|101-107|10.1016/s0165-1765(00)00268-8|pub.1027152737|3;[Bayo-Moriones, Alberto; Lera-López, Fernando]|[ur.012425765563.52; ur.07467301435.29]|Technovation|2007|27|6-7|352-366|10.1016/j.technovation.2007.01.003|pub.1030292168|198;[Attaran, Mohsen]|[ur.015612745657.75]|Information & Management|2004|41|5|585-596|10.1016/s0378-7206(03)00098-3|pub.1036529164|191;[Spanos, Yiannis E.; Prastacos, Gregory P.; Poulymenakou, Angeliki]|[ur.014266021445.71; ur.014375017755.45; ur.016502622571.39]|Information & Management|2002|39|8|659-675|10.1016/s0378-7206(01)00141-0|pub.1039143360|76;[Hunter, Larry W.; Lafkas, John J.]|[ur.012617160107.35; ur.015007501507.08]|ILR Review|2003|56|2|224-243|10.1177/001979390305600202|pub.1052927937|22;[Dı́az, Macarena Sacristán; Tomás, F.Javier Quirós]|[ur.013765026734.32; ur.013722401555.01]|International Journal of Production Economics|2002|75|3|245-256|10.1016/s0925-5273(01)00115-3|pub.1053154244|11;[Juhn, Chinhui; Murphy, Kevin M.; Pierce, Brooks]|[ur.011153576402.68; ur.014147461647.09; ]|Journal of Political Economy|1993|101|3|410-442|10.1086/261881|pub.1058575362|1407;[Galor, O.; Moav, O.]|[ur.015132351063.08; ur.01120477445.81]|The Quarterly Journal of Economics|2000|115|2|469-497|10.1162/003355300554827|pub.1063348802|327;[Card, D.; Lemieux, T.]|[ur.01020200442.77; ur.01316342302.69]|The Quarterly Journal of Economics|2001|116|2|705-746|10.1162/00335530151144140|pub.1063348848|545;[Caroli, E.; Van Reenen, J.]|[; ]|The Quarterly Journal of Economics|2001|116|4|1449-1492|10.1162/003355301753265624|pub.1063348879|517;[Bresnahan, T.

The Qatari government has launched free wireless internet parks concept under their national electronic government (e-government) initiative with a view of providing free internet access for all citizens while enjoying the outdoors. By offering free wireless internet access, the Qatari government hopes to increase accessibility of e-government services and encourage their citizens to actively participate in the global information society with a view of bridging the digital divide. The adoption and diffusion of iPark services will depend on user acceptance and availability of wireless technology. This chapter examines an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) that proposes individual differences and technology complexity to determine perceived usefulness and perceived ease of the iPark initiative by using a survey based study.

Results were obtained through paper-based and online questionnaires. A separate screening survey gave an indication of the likely demographics of the online questionnaire respondents. Eighty-seven responses were obtained from 21 countries, with the majority from the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom. The results suggest that online participants were most likely to be male, aged 25–39, live in the city, and be employed by the government at a State or Provincial level. The research questionnaire administered to around 200 people at a conference returned 99 responses, whilst the questionnaire available on the Web returned 66 responses. Coastal managers communicate online most frequently with practitioners from their own region. They are most likely to only access information from Web sites originating within their own region or from Web sites originating in North America.",Advanced Information and Knowledge Processing,2004,,,251-258,"Woodward, Emma",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005406122,0,

This paper discusses the pedagogical, technological, and business trends that together affect the direction of innovation in virtual education. A discussion is presented on how traditional higher education (campus-based, lecture-bound, and faculty-driven) can benefit from the explosion of opportunities born of technological innovation and development by adopting changes in operational models—both administrative and pedagogical. Also addressed are the scope of services that comprise the engagement of information technology in academic environments necessary to fulfill evolving charters and missions that respond to current trends and future demands of educational innovations in the digital age where education and business—in their operational models and management styles—are moving toward complementary, even comparable strategies.",IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2003,50,4,403,"Friedman, Robert S.; Deek, Fadi P.",New Jersey Institute of Technology,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1061600104,40,"[Maurer, H.]|[]|The supplemental proceedings of the conference on Integrating technology into computer science education: working group reports and supplemental proceedings  - ITiCSE-WGR '97|1997|||112-113|10.1145/266057.266127|pub.1007210624|1;[Smith, Patricia L.; Dillon, Connie L.]|[ur.013703234141.21; ur.012777172611.68]|American Journal of Distance Education|1999|13|2|6-23|10.1080/08923649909527020|pub.1026520252|59;[Merisotis, Jamie P.; Phipps, Ronald A.]|[ur.01152022670.28; ur.012754257231.13]|Change The Magazine of Higher Learning|1999|31|3|12-17|10.1080/00091389909602685|pub.1027127902|97;[Deek, Fadi P.; Deek, Maura A.; Friedman, Robert S.]|[ur.010212376153.78; ur.013572042542.96; ur.01217707560.75]|Interactive Learning Environments|1999|7|2-3|113-136|10.1076/ilee.7.2.113.7432|pub.1027631672|4;[Arbaugh, J.

The findings, based on a number of concrete case-studies, clearly confirm that, despite of the huge research and developmental effort having been made for advancing ICT applications in education, ICT as a whole is surprisingly lacking a systematic discourse with educational domains, even much less concerning those who have learning difficulties. Whilst well known technical tools such as word-processors, screen-reading software and problem-solving software packages still provide useful “snapshots” of ICT applications from particular points in time, we argue that these pictures now require updating. To enable the ICT development crossing multi-disciplinary boundaries, a meta-synthesis approach is innovated. The approach consists of four inter-operated components through ICT, i.e., assistive, sensory, communicative and interactive component.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2007,4490,,18-25,"Liu, Ying; Cornish, Annita; Clegg, June",University of Cambridge,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040283641,6,"[Mooij, Ton; Smeets, Ed]|[ur.012214377203.46; ur.01163645272.98]|Computers & Education|2001|36|3|265-281|10.1016/s0360-1315(00)00068-3|pub.1020765810|59;[Bowman, Vibiana]|[ur.014371306255.38]|Library Hi Tech|2002|20|2|162-168|10.1108/07378830210432525|pub.1029103488|10;[Williams, Peter; Jamali, Hamid R.; Nicholas, David]|[ur.015276240211.24; ur.015072140123.61; ur.011274653015.81]|Aslib Journal of Information Management|2006|58|4|330-345|10.1108/00012530610687704|pub.1030682983|45;[Bergman, Marilyn M]|[ur.01227073676.50]|Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation|2002|17|5|431-445|10.1097/00001199-200210000-00005|pub.1032084838|29;[Blischak, Doreen M.; Schlosser, Ralf W.]|[ur.0611465730.54; ur.01337666665.26]|Topics in Language Disorders|2003|23|4|293-304|10.1097/00011363-200310000-00005|pub.1038038931|37;[Ainscow, Mel]|[ur.015370466505.33]|British Journal of Special Education|2003|24|1|3-6|10.1111/1467-8527.00002|pub.1041503223|85;[Dee, Lesley; Byers, Richard]|[ur.010145057562.81; ur.012335401162.80]|Journal of Integrated Care|2003|11|3|34-38|10.1108/14769018200300033|pub.1050178005|8;[Beck, Ann R.; Parette, Phil; Bailey, Rita L.]|[ur.0735633136.46; ur.016437572341.86; ur.01040255227.20]|Journal of Special Education Technology|2005|20|4|39-49|10.1177/016264340502000405|pub.1053754061|2;[Jones, Allison; Tedd, Lucy A.]|[; ur.013347251203.61]|Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|2003|35|2|105-113|10.1177/0961000603352005|pub.1063902243|6"
pub.1040182157,10.1515/libr.2003.160,A Moral Reflection on the Information Flow From South to North: an African Perspective,"In most discussions of the digital divide, the emphasis is on assisting developing nations by facilitating the flow of information resources from the developed countries to the developing – a North-South flow. The South-North flow of information receives less attention. A number of moral questions arise from the current state of South-North information flow, six forms of which are analysed in this paper with particular reference to Africa. The discussion is approached from an ethical perspective based on a specific moral framework based on three moral claims: (1) there exist universal information-related human rights – the right of freedom of access to information, the right of freedom of expression, and the right of individuals and groups to control the information they have generated; (2) the notion of a common good, predicated on a moral community which shares certain values, imposes an obligation to share information; and (3) justice is the main normative tool that can be used to regulate the flow of information.",Libri,2003,53,3,160-173,"Britz, Johannes J.; Lor, Peter J.",University of Pretoria,South Africa,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040182157,28,"[Silver, Keith]|[]|Learned Publishing|2002|15|2|91-98|10.1087/09531510252848845|pub.1018424949|9;[Ngulube, Patrick]|[ur.011524744671.08]|Information Development|2002|18|2|95-102|10.1177/026666602400842486|pub.1018481693|50;[Rosenberg, Diana]|[ur.012112106067.69]|Learned Publishing|2002|15|1|51-57|10.1087/095315102753303689|pub.1020339303|15;[Muswazi, Paiki]|[ur.014507116563.36]|Information Development|2001|17|4|250-256|10.1177/0266666014241079|pub.1028764950|6;[Fernandez, Leila]|[]|Internet Reference Services Quarterly|1999|4|4|19-27|10.1300/j136v04n04_04|pub.1042881353|2;[Ganguli, Prabuddha]|[ur.011524753033.19]|World Patent Information|2000|22|1-2|43-52|10.1016/s0172-2190(00)00029-6|pub.1049474379|25;[]|[]|Choice|1998|35|07|35-3911-35-3911|10.5860/choice.35-3911|pub.1073349172|324"

It details the deployment of the approach in a pilot study of kiosk-based delivery for health and general Citizens Advice Bureau services. The study showed that the kiosk design appeared to address basic usability and accessibility needs, but the system had architectural problems that seriously impacted on its usability. These problems only came to light when a deeper analysis of clients’ information seeking needs was factored in. This case study demonstrates the need for a multi-perspective approach to evaluation — fit for purpose — to facilitate not only identification but also deep diagnosis of usability problems. The paper concludes with lessons we have learnt about methodological issues and how one might orchestrate nine different user-centred techniques in order to understand why, as in this case, apparently well designed systems do not satisfy the needs of its target users.",People and Computers XIX — The Bigger Picture,2006,,,149-165,"William Wong, B L; Keith, Suzette; Springett, Mark",Middlesex University,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1031630573,0,"[Bishop, Ann Peterson]|[ur.014126753237.06]|Proceedings of the fourth ACM conference on Digital libraries  - DL '99|1999|||94-103|10.1145/313238.313267|pub.1026347891|14;[Keenan, Susan L.; Hartson, H.

Community-dwelling older adults aged 60–88 years completed a postal questionnaire survey that elicited responses on the use of the Internet. Out of a sample of 592 older adults (236 males and 356 females), 50.7% used the Internet. A multiple linear regression analysis was carried out on the Internet users sample using the self-reported number of hours of Internet usage per week as the dependent variable.

pub.1013041072,10.1016/j.infoecopol.2010.12.001,Costs or gross benefits? – What mainly drives cross-sectional variance in Internet adoption,"In this paper, we propose an empirical model of Internet adoption which takes into account the household’s desire to adopt the Internet. Our research supports three central findings. First, we determine the main factors that explain the cross-sectional variance in gross benefits. Second, we estimate the predicted probabilities that a household does not desire to adopt the Internet and that a household desires to adopt the Internet but does not because its adoption costs are higher than its gross benefits. We show that while the cross-sectional variance in the first predicted probability is high, the cross-sectional variance in the second one is low (except for the age factor). Third, we compute the predicted adoption probability assuming that the adoption costs are homogeneous across households. We show that, for a given dimension (except for the age factor), the adoption rate will be only slightly modified if the adoption costs are homogeneous across households. Our results support the argument that the digital divide is mainly due to differences in gross benefits of adoption.",Information Economics and Policy,2011,23,1,127-140,"Drouard, Joeffrey",Télécom ParisTech; European University Institute,France; Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013041072,14,"[Goldfarb, Avi]|[ur.0636245456.94]|International Journal of Industrial Organization|2006|24|2|203-225|10.1016/j.ijindorg.2005.11.004|pub.1009265685|42;[Goldfarb, Avi; Prince, Jeff]|[ur.0636245456.94; ]|Information Economics and Policy|2008|20|1|2-15|10.1016/j.infoecopol.2007.05.001|pub.1014279471|257;[Forman, Chris; Goldfarb, Avi; Greenstein, Shane]|[ur.015375154201.15; ur.0636245456.94; ur.015422614573.48]|Journal of Urban Economics|2005|58|3|389-420|10.1016/j.jue.2005.05.004|pub.1016743809|154;[Suire, Raphaël]|[ur.010441035457.56]|Économie & prévision|2007|180|4|161-174|10.3406/ecop.2007.7677|pub.1024993491|6;[Chaudhuri, Anindya; Flamm, Kenneth S.; Horrigan, John]|[ur.016531361071.37; ur.013543457071.02; ]|Telecommunications Policy|2005|29|9-10|731-755|10.1016/j.telpol.2005.07.001|pub.1027604222|129;[Zhang, Junyi; Kuwano, Masashi; Lee, Backjin; Fujiwara, Akimasa]|[ur.012046477501.49; ur.011725106731.61; ur.0713164342.40; ur.013235725711.02]|Transportation Research Part B Methodological|2009|43|2|230-250|10.1016/j.trb.2008.05.002|pub.1034372501|92;[Flamm, Kenneth; Chaudhuri, Anindya]|[ur.013543457071.02; ur.016531361071.37]|Telecommunications Policy|2007|31|6-7|312-326|10.1016/j.telpol.2007.05.006|pub.1044727995|122;[Prieger, James E.; Hu, Wei-Min]|[ur.014605206564.75; ur.015647042476.65]|Information Economics and Policy|2008|20|2|150-167|10.1016/j.infoecopol.2008.01.001|pub.1048063804|139;[Goolsbee, Austan; Klenow, Peter J.]|[ur.014677654741.57; ur.010423026174.84]|The Journal of Law and Economics|2002|45|2|317-343|10.1086/344399|pub.1058640424|226;[]|[]|Choice|1993|30|11|30-6408-30-6408|10.5860/choice.30-6408|pub.1073318683|1859;[Krueger, Alan B.]|[ur.0655705467.19]|SSRN Electronic Journal|2000||||10.2139/ssrn.223749|pub.1102186415|10;[Prieger, James E.]|[ur.014605206564.75]|SSRN Electronic Journal|2008||||10.2139/ssrn.1306427|pub.1102257964|2"

The African Center for ICT Innovation and Training1, an American University of Nigeria community engagement initiative is used as a case study to gauge its importance as an ICT resource center for the community and for small businesses and whether applied skills in information technology for university faculty and staff taught at the Center is leading to more productivity. The Yola and Jimeta Communities are also surveyed to find out whether the activities of the Centre and its interventions on developing ICT competencies and capacity building is helping to bridge the digital divide and empowering the community, especially women.Keywords: ICT and Development, ICT social-economic development, ICT and women, Universities and Development",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2008,282,,223-239,"Kah, Jainaba M.

The research is conducted by using data collected over time by the Piedmont ICT Observatory (PICTO) through a survey on a sample of 2,000 citizens and then comparing them with Eurostat data. Focusing on Piedmont data, multivariate analysis shows that age and education level are the two most important variables that influence Internet usage. Moreover comparing Piedmont with similar European regions, this research has found out that the value reached by Piedmont is not enough high and that this is due to the ageing of Piedmont population and to its lower educational level, confirming the findings of the first part of the study. Thus, the analysis of e-inclusion policies implemented in such regions aimed to bridge this gap and addressed to the part of the population that has been identified as excluded, would help the policy maker to better understand which actions could be undertaken to increase the number of Internet users in the region.",International Conference on Information Society (i-Society 2011),2011,,,279-286,"Pautasso, Elisa; Ferro, Enrico; Raguseo, Elisabetta",Istituto Superiore Mario Boella; Polytechnic University of Turin,Italy; Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124464411,1,
pub.1095113568,10.1109/istas.2011.7160610,Adoption of Mobile Advertising,"The world has undergone rapid changes over the last three decades due to advances in Information and communication Technologies (ICT). Among the ICTs, mobile technology is seen to be the most favorable and rapidly evolving technology. Mobile technology is playing an increasingly significant role in the lives of people around the world. In developing economies, mobile phones have changed the lifestyles of people from all segments of the population. Mobile technology is easier, faster and considerably cheaper to deploy than fixed technology, making mobile technology the most feasible solution in closing the digital divide and socioeconomic gap between people. One of the new revenue generating areas for mobile operators is mobile advertising (m-advertising). In this paper, factors influencing consumer adoption of m-advertising in Malaysia is studied. Using a sample of 300 respondents in Malaysia, the study identifies Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Social Influence (SI) as the strongest factors influencing the acceptance of the m-advertising. The study provides valuable insights for policy makers and telecommunication operators in formulating policies to enhance m-advertising adoption in Malaysia.",2011 IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS),2011,,,1-5,"Wong, Chin Chin; Vaithilingam, Santha; Nair, Mahendhiran",Monash University Malaysia,Malaysia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095113568,0,"[Sivo, Stephen A.; Fan, Xitao; Witta, E.

pub.1067625103,10.15209/jbsge.v2i3.107,Internet Access on the Cheap: The Power of the Co-Op,"Internet access in the former socialist block continues to lag behind more developed countries. Unequal access to Information Technology has produced uneven levels of participation in the networked economy and society. Internet access, which is important to maintaining a technologically competent labour force, is a staple in the developed countries. However, it continues to be limited in Romania. Would-be users are devising inventive solutions to the relatively costly access solutions in order to get on the Information Highway. A country case study of Internet access in Romania reveals the advent of self-established, co-operative networks providing shared Internet access - seemingly a unique and innovative approach. Several of the Internet access plans on the market are presented in this paper together with a discussion of cyber cafés and the home-grown, co-operative networks that seem to be popping up all over the country. Understanding the context within which these home-grown networks arise and prosper offers valuable lessons and ideas for transferring these approaches to other developing countries that, like Romania, are struggling to bridge the infamous digital divide.",Journal of Business Systems Governance & Ethics,2007,2,3,,"Gudea, Sorin",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1067625103,2,

In this regard, best-practice, emerging Information Communications Technology (ICT) and e-business potential are leveraged to provide 24*7 access to online public services, ranging from online tax forms, to online voting. Whilst much may have been achieved towards developing and supporting one-stop shop to a range of online government services, more research is required, for instance, to provide a seamless integration and interoperation of these services, their integration with legacy systems, and risk management strategy. Based on an ongoing research focused on risk modelling and analysis of eGovernment web services, this paper introduces a categorisation of the main generic risk factors. The paper only elaborates on the first two categories of the risk factors and develops a set of potential success factors for eGovernment.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2002,2456,,395-402,"Evangelidis, A.; Akomode, J.; Taleb-Bendiab, A.; Taylor, M.",Liverpool John Moores University,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023359621,22,"[Mercuri, Rebecca]|[ur.016470074133.75]|Communications of the ACM|2000|43|11|176|10.1145/353360.353378|pub.1010501377|5;[Watson, Richard T.; Mundy, Bryan]|[ur.012611725373.97; ]|Communications of the ACM|2001|44|1|27-30|10.1145/357489.357499|pub.1040724507|92;[Phillips, Deborah M.; von Spakovsky, Hans A.]|[; ]|Communications of the ACM|2001|44|1|73-ff.|10.1145/357489.357512|pub.1045705328|28"
pub.1016064429,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2004.07.001,Socio-economic background and computer use: the role of computer anxiety and computer experience in their relationship,"The proposition that socio-economic background relates to amount of current computer use indirectly, via its relationship with computer experience and computer anxiety, was tested with questionnaire data from a sample of 267 university students. The results supported the proposition, as they indicated a causal path model that contained a positive indirect relationship of socio-economic background with the amount of current computer use, via computer experience and computer anxiety. Socio-economic background had a direct positive relationship with computer experience and an indirect negative relationship with computer anxiety. The pattern of relationships was held over and above the variance accounted for by the set of control variables that included, among others, computer access and sex.

As the digital divide seems to grow, the question becomes how will developing countries catch up? We examine two large developing countries, China and India, in an attempt to understand their approaches to developing e-business. While both countries had access to the technology at about the same time, each has taken a different path to utilizing it. These approaches are based on a number of factors, including government initiatives and focus, infrastructure building, experience and understanding of business operations, and culture, among others. China appears to be ahead of India in the mechanics and infrastructure, but India is ahead in e-readiness. Both countries are poised for rapidly increasing e-business, however, they have huge problems of poverty and inequality between urban and rural connectivity that must be resolved to take advantage of e-business.",Advances in E-Business Research,2008,,,138-157,"Lee, In; Raven, Peter; Huang, Xiaoqing; Kim, Ben",Seattle University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014499304,0,"[Kiiski, Sampsa; Pohjola, Matti]|[ur.012603406201.20; ur.013107663011.00]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|297-310|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00071-3|pub.1001159834|314;[Di Benedetto, C.

pub.1094792964,10.1109/hicss.2011.211,Gender and Public Access Computing: an International Perspective,"Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), and public access to computers with Internet connectivity in particular, can assist community development efforts and help bridge the so-called digital divide. However, use of ICT is not gender neutral. Technical, social, and cultural barriers emphasize women's exclusion from the benefits of ICT for development. This paper offers a qualitative analysis of the benefits of ICT and the barriers facing women to fully realize those benefits, particularly through public access to computers and Internet in libraries, telecenters, and cybercafes. Individual benefits include increased self-esteem, reduced isolation, access to markets, empowerment, and access to health information. Collective benefits include economic growth, improved health and education, capacity building, and cultural transformation. Barriers that are particularly significant to women are location, infrastructure, and connectivity; time and money; lack of relevant content; low education and literacy; and social norms and perceptions. This paper draws from publicly available reports of a larger study of public access venues in 25 developing countries around the world.",2011 44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,2011,1,,1-11,"Terry, Allison; Gomez, Ricardo",University of Washington,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094792964,13,"[Comfort, Kazanka; Goje, Lydia; Funmilola, Kachong]|[ur.013256672743.24; ; ]|Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2005|29|6|24-25|10.1002/bult.294|pub.1006489588|9;[Goulding, Anne; Spacey, Rachel]|[ur.010652214421.26; ur.011255437267.86]|IFLA Journal|2003|29|1|33-40|10.1177/034003520302900109|pub.1008352426|16;[Isgro, Kirsten Lynn; Cooks, Leda M.]|[ur.010352364351.19; ur.010611476416.53]|Frontiers A Journal of Women Studies|2005|26|1|71-89|10.1353/fro.2005.0005|pub.1008466538|13;[Mbarika, Victor W.

pub.1093786743,10.1109/icste.2010.5608757,Empirical Analysis of Ethical Issues in the Era of Future Information Technology,"Ethical issues should go along with development in the age of globalization; same is the case with Information Technology (IT), a sub domain of Technology. IT is growing and developing rapidly with the lightening speed, probably leaving some ethical issues, considerations, principles and legal requirements lagging behind. The future of ethical IT plays an significant and realistic role in the way of bright and flourishing world. The idea and efforts to use ethics in IT gives an open, safe, transparent and reliable environment to the society. New directions of conceptualization and interpretation enables people to see the Information Technology-Society Relationship differently and therefore, interpret its social and ethical implications in a different manner. Today, IT and globalization together gave world the terms like, Universal Access, Digital Divide, e-content, e-Democracy, Hacking, Cyber Crimes and Cyber War, the newly added concepts and problems.

As the digital divide seems to grow, the question becomes how will developing countries catch up? We examine two large developing countries, China and India, in an attempt to understand their approaches to developing e-business. While both countries had access to the technology at about the same time, each has taken a different path to utilizing it. These approaches are based on a number of factors, including government initiatives and focus, infrastructure building, experience and understanding of business operations, and culture, among others. China appears to be ahead of India in the mechanics and infrastructure, but India is ahead in e-readiness. Both countries are poised for rapidly increasing e-business, however, they have huge problems of poverty and inequality between urban and rural connectivity must be resolved to really take advantage of e-business.",International Journal of E-Business Research,2007,3,1,91-108,"Raven, Peter V.; Huang, Xiaoqing; Kim, Ben B.",Seattle University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1048194943,28,

However, low population density makes it difficult for rural areas to support expensive technology investments such as are required for broadband. In addition, history shows rural adoption timelines significantly lag those in urban areas, which slows development of the demand economically necessary to support infrastructure construction.This study examined variables that influenced rural residents’ comparatively early adoption of information technologies at a time when the rural-urban digital divide in the use of basic online services was still growing. The study found employment by a company that was using specific information technologies was the strongest predictor of individual adoption. The effect was particularly strong among those with less formal education. The findings suggest rural development specialists should focus on encouraging locally owned rural businesses to adopt information technologies as a means of maximizing local diffusion and increasing demand levels.",Government Information Quarterly,2003,20,2,135-150,"Hollifield, C.Ann; Donnermeyer, Joseph F",University of Georgia; The Ohio State University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040349281,71,

A national information network now exists yet this infrastructure--largely hardware--needs to be continually modernized and parlayed with commitments to building human capacity, developing relevant content, and scaling socially beneficial technology applications, such as telemedicine, in order to optimize these initial multi-billion-dollar outlays. This article makes the case that sidestepping public-private initiatives aimed at accelerating digital opportunity is imprudent, given the mounting empirical evidence highlighting the payoffs of information and communications technologies, when properly integrated and applied, especially in enhancing the life chances of underserved Americans.

Issues raised are linked to the dominant discourse of the ‘digital divide’, which in the UK means engaging with ICTs in a ‘meaningful’ way to ensure the economic and social well-being of UK plc (public limited company—in the UK this refers to companies whose shares can be sold to the public. The acronym is used here ironically to indicate the motivation of the government to brand and promote the UK as a whole.). Utilising a framework of understanding digital inequality and the ‘deepening divide’, domestication theory is applied to discuss motivational, material and physical, skills and usage access in the gendered household, critically contrasting this approach to ‘smart house’ research.

This paper presents an innovative approach to access the end user, relying on infrastructural integration of femtocellular technology with existing cabled network. Usually, the adoption of Femtocell Access Points, operating in the licensed cellular bands typically designed to be used in SOHO, improves the radio coverage and the building penetration of the existing mobile networks, based on macrocells. In the proposed solution, the peculiar functionality of femtocells is further improved using a MATV/SMATV cabled infrastructure which facilitates the signal connection inside the building.

pub.1068645602,10.18489/sacj.v44i0.25,Learner Inclinations to Study Computer Science or Information Systems at Tertiary Level,"After the so‐called “dot‐com crash” of the Internet in the early 2000s, tertiary level student enrolments in IT‐related subjects began to experience a significant decline both in international countries and South Africa. The paper replicates research done in the Western Cape, South Africa, by Seymour et al. (2005) [20], in which grade 12 learner inclinations to study Computer Science (CS) and Information Systems (IS) at tertiary level were analysed and underlying factors affecting their interest in the subjects were determined. The study analyses the “misguided” perceptions that learners and students have of these subjects; the implications of the decline in enrolments on students, educational sectors and industry; and determines a set of underlying factors that influence learners in their attitudes toward further degrees in IT, starting from the secondary level of education. The research compares South African Eastern Cape learner perceptions with those from the Western Cape study and establishes three to four years later, that the reasons behind the decline in IT enrolments are still influenced by an underlying demographic and digital divide.",South African Computer Journal,2010,44,0,,"Jacobs, C; Sewry, DA",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1068645602,2,"[Denning, Peter J.; McGettrick, Andrew]|[ur.011465535447.55; ur.010665670275.05]|Communications of the ACM|2005|48|11|15-19|10.1145/1096000.1096018|pub.1002255395|67;[Arora, Sanjeev; Chazelle, Bernard]|[ur.0703367214.03; ur.011771303644.88]|Communications of the ACM|2005|48|8|31-33|10.1145/1076211.1076233|pub.1010208189|10;[Cale, Edward G.; Mawhinney, Charles H.; Callaghan, David R.]|[ur.07556057413.98; ur.011036124417.69; ur.013217705505.12]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1991|8|1|167-181|10.1080/07421222.1991.11517916|pub.1046601798|7"

We borrow from constructivist learning theory and argue that it is helpful to see knowledge as a process rather than as an outcome or state. In discussions of access to knowledge, much emphasis has been placed on the physical dimension of access (connectivity, bandwidth and the digital divide) and on the legal, economic and political dimensions that form the embattled terrain of the ‘Access to Knowledge’ movement. However, if knowledge is conceptualized as a process, the concept of ‘access’ has to be extended to the epistemological dimension, which takes into account the construction of knowledge in the mind of the individual while interacting with the community. This has important implications for libraries. We suggest the deployment of re-skilled and re-motivated information intermediaries working in and around libraries to motivate, teach, interpret and facilitate ‘access’ to knowledge.",Journal of Information Science,2010,36,5,655-667,"Lor, Peter Johan; Britz, Johannes",University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee; University of Pretoria,United States; South Africa,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063751220,4,"[Webster, Professor Frank; Webster, Frank]|[; ]||1995||||10.4324/9780203426265|pub.1002852452|318;[Meyer, Derek Louis]|[ur.016114730537.53]|Educational Philosophy and Theory|2009|41|3|332-341|10.1111/j.1469-5812.2008.00457.x|pub.1027233617|25;[Zakaria, Sohaimi; Nagata, Haruki]|[ur.012742424703.91; ur.013644544347.76]|Library Management|2010|31|1/2|27-35|10.1108/01435121011013377|pub.1036270168|5;[Fourie, Ina]|[ur.011263112272.22]|The Electronic Library|1999|17|1|9-16|10.1108/02640479910329400|pub.1043162077|20;[Munyua, Hilda; Stilwell, Christine]|[ur.012744660362.00; ur.016301064612.08]|Library Management|2010|31|1/2|5-18|10.1108/01435121011013359|pub.1051628977|17;[Mahoney, Michael J.]|[]|PsycCRITIQUES|2004|49|3|360-363|10.1037/004362|pub.1056362955|21;[Lor, Peter Johan; Britz, Johannes Jacobus]|[ur.010520131601.35; ur.011632357122.07]|Journal of Information Science|2007|33|4|387-397|10.1177/0165551506075327|pub.1063751086|45;[Dralega, C.

It has become imperative for the Chinese government to improve its governance performance. In 2008, Beijing initiated several Internet-related policies to increase its government's transparency and accountability. Those new policies include a adopting the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Open Government Information and b utilizing information technologies to increase communication between the government and the general public. However, these policies were not designed to “serve the people,” and instead are based on the Chinese Communist Party's need to increase its legitimacy. More importantly, there are various hurdles for the implementation of those policies. These hurdles include the communist government's weak political credibility, policy barriers in the legal perspectives, and digital divide and information disparities in China.

As residential broadband options such as cable and xDSL grow in popularity, broadband providers continue to roll out service in select market areas. However, due to technological limitations, some locations qualify for xDSL broadband service while others do not. The purpose of this article is to examine the impact of local geography on broadband (xDSL) network access. This type of micro-geographic analysis is important in two ways. First, a detailed analysis at the local level can reveal the spatial disparities in infrastructure access. Second, because broadband access is quickly emerging as the technology of choice for both small businesses and households, it is important to consider which locations will have opportunities for these connections and which locations will not. Utilising an integer programming model, the maximal covering location problem, and a geographic information system, xDSL broadband access is evaluated in Columbus, Ohio. Results indicate that many suburban areas can be left without adequate service.",Papers of the Regional Science Association,2002,81,2,197-221,"Grubesic, Tony H.; Murray, Alan T.",The Ohio State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041955449,89,

However, right from its inception, a number of controversies have surrounded the program including the right of the FCC to impose a “tax” on the telecommunications industry, the status of the Universal Service Administration Company, allegations of fraud in the allocation of funds to schools and libraries, and questions whether Internet access to schools was furthering the cause of educational equity. A number of these questions have been settled through court cases and administrative reform, but doubts about the future of the program still persist so much so that the US Congress is currently considering proposals to terminate or reform the e‐rate program. Keeping in mind these controversies and the achievements to date of the program, this paper compares a number of policy proposals that have been put forward recently. It recommends among other things that the future effectiveness of the e‐rate program may be best served by enabling a shift of funding from telecommunications access to software and content development.",Info,2004,6,1,37-51,"Jayakar, Krishna P.",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025845183,10,"[Shuler, John A.]|[]|Government Information Quarterly|1999|16|4|359-369|10.1016/s0740-624x(00)86841-0|pub.1043114564|8;[]|[]|Network Security|2003|2003|11|14-15|10.1016/s1353-4858(03)01108-5|pub.1049209036|2;[Christmann, Edwin; Badgett, John; Lucking, Robert]|[ur.016136425333.74; ur.011273645035.46; ur.014266267121.71]|Journal of Research on Computing in Education|1997|29|4|325-337|10.1080/08886504.1997.10782202|pub.1049689962|29;[Bertot, John Carlo]|[ur.011253735727.32]|The Journal of Academic Librarianship|2000|26|1|45-48|10.1016/s0099-1333(99)00122-6|pub.1052440079|1;[Smeeding, Timothy M.]|[]|Indicators|2002|1|3|6-30|10.1080/15357449.2002.11069141|pub.1092016578|46;[]|[]|Oversold and Underused, Computers in the Classroom|2001||||10.4159/9780674030107|pub.1144896359|514"

The World Wide Web, which affords so many educational applications friendly to designers as well as to the users, has lived up to its name by reaching nearly all countries through the internet infrastructure. Online education at first suggests education through the internet, but the “line” in online and offline refers more broadly to networked computers. By necessity in some countries, or by choice, Intranets and other systems of digital devices such as mobile phones, whether connected by ground wires or by satellites, can also serve as media for formal education and informal learning.

Development of strategies to help insure that older people have equal opportunities to access computer technology depends on understanding why they have lower adoption rates. This paper examines changes in attitudes towards computers over time among a sample of 745 adults ranging in age from 18 — 75 yrs. Attitudes towards computers were assessed using the Attitudes Towards Computers Questionnaire across two time periods: 1994-1997 and 2000-2004. Over time, participants rated computers as less dehumanizing and reported an increased belief that computers were equally important to both genders. There were also age groups differences in ratings of comfort, efficacy, and control. The older adults reported less comfort, competence with computers. Over time, perceptions of having control over computers increased over time for the younger people but not for the middle-aged and older people.

In particular, they have attractions in their potential to bridge the digital divide. There is some evidence to suggest that the citizen uptake of kiosks and indeed other channels for e-government, such as web sites, is slow, although studies on the use of kiosks for health information provision offer some interesting perspectives on user behaviour with kiosk technology. This article argues that the delivery of e-government through kiosks presents a number of strategic challenges, which will need to be negotiated over the next few years in order that kiosk applications can be successful in enhancing accessibility to and engagement with e-government. The article suggests that this involves consideration of: the applications to be delivered through a kiosk; one stop shop service and knowledge architectures; mechanisms for citizen identification; and the integration of kiosks within the total interface between public bodies and their communities.

pub.1043548300,10.1007/11823100_9,‘Mind the Gap’: e-Government and e-Democracy,"It is claimed that Internet technology offers governments the opportunity to engage citizens online and bridge the growing gap between citizens and the state. In the current climate of citizen disengagement this is a potentially important prospect. Academic studies into e-government tend to follow a well-trodden path of technology acceptance, citizens’ willingness and ability to use public services online and the digital divide. Where issues of e-democracy are considered, studies generally highlight opportunities rather than measuring any actual changes in citizen behaviour. This study examines citizens’ perceptions, attitudes and behaviour, seeking specifically to expose whether citizens feel that e-government enhances democratic participation and brings them closer to government and the machinery of the state. In this paper we present the results of the pilot study which suggest that citizens perceive some moderate value in using e-government as a means of keeping themselves informed and communicating with the state, but little value in e-government as a tool of democratic participation.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2006,4084,,96-106,"Kolsaker, Ailsa; Lee-Kelley, Liz",University of Surrey,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043548300,16,"[Kolsaker, Ailsa; Lee‐Kelley, Liz; Choy, Pui Ching]|[ur.016622131027.01; ur.014047374707.20; ]|International Journal of Consumer Studies|2004|28|3|295-304|10.1111/j.1470-6431.2004.00373.x|pub.1000746621|49;[Ling, Tom]|[]|Public Administration|2002|80|4|615-642|10.1111/1467-9299.00321|pub.1002528519|293;[Cai, Shaohan; Jun, Minjoon]|[ur.011600477032.78; ur.014342621170.45]|Managing Service Quality: An International Journal|2003|13|6|504-519|10.1108/09604520310506568|pub.1004446643|149;[Lee-Kelley, Liz; James, Thomas]|[ur.014047374707.20; ur.011707456233.77]|Journal of Electronic Commerce in Organizations|2003|1|4|1-16|10.4018/jeco.2003100101|pub.1016160452|14;[Joint, Nicholas]|[ur.014717021372.50]|Library Review|2005|54|2|80-85|10.1108/00242530510583020|pub.1020771886|9;[Douglas, Alex; Muir, Lindsey; Meehan, Karon]|[ur.012442415135.10; ur.011047454135.05; ur.010770603463.64]|Managing Service Quality: An International Journal|2003|13|6|483-491|10.1108/09604520310506540|pub.1025598925|20;[Kuo, Ying-Feng]|[]|Total Quality Management & Business Excellence|2004|15|7|925-939|10.1080/14783360410001681854|pub.1025644507|82;[Szymanski, David M.; Hise, Richard T.]|[; ur.014161305105.45]|Journal of Retailing|2000|76|3|309-322|10.1016/s0022-4359(00)00035-x|pub.1033210171|1144;[Line, Maurice B.]|[ur.015601666107.12]|Library Management|2003|24|8/9|386-392|10.1108/01435120310501059|pub.1035338502|4;[Hsu, Meng-Hsiang; Chiu, Chao-Min]|[ur.010422123675.97; ur.07624543275.75]|Decision Support Systems|2004|38|3|369-381|10.1016/j.dss.2003.08.001|pub.1036932121|420;[Meuter, Matthew L.; Ostrom, Amy L.; Roundtree, Robert I.; Bitner, Mary Jo]|[ur.015112030015.81; ur.010275411025.95; ur.07501503221.41; ur.015407174021.11]|Journal of Marketing|2000|64|3|50-64|10.1509/jmkg.64.3.50.18024|pub.1040797064|1619;[Cavanaugh, John W.]|[]|National Civic Review|2000|89|3|229-234|10.1002/ncr.89305|pub.1042586435|11;[Barnes, Marian; Newman, Janet; Knops, Andrew; Sullivan, Helen]|[ur.011547543053.39; ur.012545273453.72; ur.013027067431.51; ur.01365601644.52]|Public Administration|2003|81|2|379-399|10.1111/1467-9299.00352|pub.1045101617|228;[Piccoli, Gabriele; Brohman, M.

In 1944, Karl Polanyi identified similar contradictions in the industrial revolution, except the flowing material was capital instead of information. He spent a lifetime exposing what he felt to be the negative consequences of this increasingly free-flowing capital, the hallmark of a free market economy. He advocated for a welfare state in which government intervention is necessary to control these negative effects. Given issues of the information age such as the digital divide, the commoditization of information, and security and privacy, as well as the arguments of the proponents and critics of these issues, Polanyi's concepts can provide insight into the complexities of increasingly technical and information-based societies.",Information Communication & Society,2003,6,1,105-124,"Rogerson, Kenneth S.",Duke University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024273626,3,"[Braman, Sandra]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1989|13|3|233-242|10.1016/0308-5961(89)90006-2|pub.1001891590|80;[Ozawa, Terutomo; Castello, Sergio; Phillips, Ronnie J.]|[ur.07636730771.88; ur.010775623473.49; ]|Journal of Economic Issues|2001|35|2|289-298|10.1080/00213624.2001.11506362|pub.1021266350|10;[]|[]|Choice|2002|40|01|40-0535-40-0535|10.5860/choice.40-0535|pub.1073382108|229"

The increasing connectivity, together with the fact that IDTV users are no longer passive spectators, permits to start thinking on highly interactive services that support fluid communication among users and service providers. This may enhance the prospects of learning at home, as long as the current offer is mostly based on broadcast content, with scarce use of return channels for feedback. This paper proposes an extension to the Multimedia Home Platform standard, aimed at providing better support for collaborative learning services. We describe an architecture for such services and a selection of freely available technologies for their implementation. We also discuss the possible market implications of our approach, as the ideas presented here contribute to openness in the field of IDTV services.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2004,3143,,83-90,"López-Nores, Martín; Blanco-Fernández, Yolanda; Fernández-Vilas, Ana; Díaz-Redondo, Rebeca P.; Pazos-Arias, José J.; Gil-Solla, Alberto; García-Duque, Jorge; Barragáns-Martínez, Belén; Ramos-Cabrer, Manuel",Universidade de Vigo,Spain,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001447643,1,"[López-Nores, Martín; Fernández-Vilas, Ana; Díaz-Redondo, Rebeca P.; Gil-Solla, Alberto; Pazos-Arias, José J.; Ramos-Cabrer, Manuel; García-Duque, Jorge]|[ur.011063763046.69; ur.014576163641.79; ur.011717014421.23; ur.07526473021.41; ur.015344001302.47; ur.010324053421.21; ur.07471022046.60]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2003|2899||376-387|10.1007/978-3-540-40012-7_31|pub.1016987968|8;[Alexander, Shirley]|[ur.014634147551.15]|Education + Training|2001|43|4/5|240-248|10.1108/00400910110399247|pub.1048309221|191"

In North America and Western Europe, nearly 70% of citizens use the Internet on a regular basis, whereas in Africa less than 4% do so. Such inequality impacts business and trade, online education and libraries, telemedicine and health resources, and political information and e-government. In response, a group of educators and community leaders in South Africa and the United States have used various information technologies to create a ?global classroom? that connects people in the two countries. University students, high school students, and other citizens communicate via Internet exchanges, video conferencing, and digital photo essays. The project has produced a number of tangible benefits and it has developed a model for reducing inequality in global education, at least for those institutions with the technological resources to participate.

In the first experiment, the authors constructed a service robot system, which makes networked robots exchange and provide the information to customers by recognizing their actions, to show the basis concept of the paper. In the second experiment, the authors show the possibility of using interactive data mining, which uses visualization techniques to help human add judgments, to improve the results of the first experiment.

pub.1068645608,10.18489/sacj.v45i0.34,Learner Inclinations to Study Computer Science or Information Systems at Tertiary Level,"After the so-called “dot-com crash” of the Internet in the early 2000s, tertiary level student enrolments in IT-related subjects began to experience a significant decline both in international countries and South Africa. The paper replicates research done in the Western Cape, South Africa, by Seymour et al. (2005) [20], in which grade 12 learner inclinations to study Computer Science (CS) and Information Systems (IS) at tertiary level were analysed and underlying factors affecting their interest in the subjects were determined. The study analyses the “misguided” perceptions that learners and students have of these subjects; the implications of the decline in enrolments on students, educational sectors and industry; and determines a set of underlying factors that influence learners in their attitudes toward further degrees in IT, starting from the secondary level of education. The research compares South African Eastern Cape learner perceptions with those from the Western Cape study and establishes three to four years later, that the reasons behind the decline in IT enrolments are still influenced by an underlying demographic and digital divide.",South African Computer Journal,2010,45,0,,"Jacobs, C; Sewry, D A",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1068645608,3,"[Denning, Peter J.; McGettrick, Andrew]|[ur.011465535447.55; ur.010665670275.05]|Communications of the ACM|2005|48|11|15-19|10.1145/1096000.1096018|pub.1002255395|67;[Arora, Sanjeev; Chazelle, Bernard]|[ur.0703367214.03; ur.011771303644.88]|Communications of the ACM|2005|48|8|31-33|10.1145/1076211.1076233|pub.1010208189|10;[Klawe, Maria]|[ur.011502537263.39]|ACM SIGCSE Bulletin|2005|37|3|3-3|10.1145/1151954.1067449|pub.1010940829|2;[Cale, Edward G.; Mawhinney, Charles H.; Callaghan, David R.]|[ur.07556057413.98; ur.011036124417.69; ur.013217705505.12]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1991|8|1|167-181|10.1080/07421222.1991.11517916|pub.1046601798|7;[Klawe, Maria; Shneiderman, Ben]|[ur.011502537263.39; ur.013052653253.13]|Communications of the ACM|2005|48|11|27-28|10.1145/1096000.1096024|pub.1047024100|17;[Patterson, David A.]|[ur.012237726304.23]|Communications of the ACM|2005|48|9|25-28|10.1145/1081992.1082011|pub.1050729829|37"

Information and communication technology (ICT) is the prime driving force of EG. Therefore, before implementing an EG project, it is vital to investigate the capability of developing countries to adopt ICT and research the impact of adopting ICT in that society. The authors argue that the purposes of implementing EG can only be accomplished and the full benefits of EG realized if a majority of the population of developing countries has the ability to adopt ICT, the main driver of EG. Therefore, it is essential for policy makers of developing countries to study the adoption capability of ICT of citizens prior to launching EG. Otherwise, there is the strong possibility that EG projects could not accomplish the purpose of its implementation and could fail to reduce the digital divide, establish equal rights for all citizens, and promote good governance.",Handbook of Research on Contemporary Theoretical Models in Information Systems,2009,,,193-211,"Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Lal, Banita; Williams, Michael D.; Schneberger, Scott L.; Wade, Michael; Shareef, Mahmud Akhter; Kumar, Vinod; Kumar, Uma; Hasin, Ahsan Akhter",Carleton University; Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology,Canada; Bangladesh,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050763102,4,"[Walsham, Geoff; Sahay, Sundeep]|[ur.012623025165.11; ur.012234426741.58]|Information Technology for Development|2006|12|1|7-24|10.1002/itdj.20020|pub.1001019163|291;[Bélanger, France; Carter, Lemuria]|[ur.07347634165.87; ur.010501313522.42]|The Journal of Strategic Information Systems|2008|17|2|165-176|10.1016/j.jsis.2007.12.002|pub.1001223371|685;[Cusumano, Michael A.; Elenkov, Detelin]|[ur.012211273117.40; ur.015601335676.18]|Research Policy|1994|23|2|195-215|10.1016/0048-7333(94)90053-1|pub.1004181837|81;[Ho, Alfred Tat‐Kei]|[ur.015771663665.85]|Public Administration Review|2002|62|4|434-444|10.1111/0033-3352.00197|pub.1004381953|639;[Mansell, Robin]|[ur.013665171232.89]|Current Sociology|2002|50|3|407-426|10.1177/0011392102050003007|pub.1004956599|130;[Cresswell, Anthony M.; Pardo, Theresa A.]|[ur.015070517706.01; ur.012053623220.70]|Government Information Quarterly|2001|18|4|269-278|10.1016/s0740-624x(01)00086-7|pub.1005119296|21;[Gilbert, David; Balestrini, Pierre; Littleboy, Darren]|[; ur.07406012414.30; ]|International Journal of Public Sector Management|2004|17|4|286-301|10.1108/09513550410539794|pub.1008733572|282;[Jaeger, Paul T; Thompson, Kim M]|[ur.011542112017.14; ur.014776367265.07]|Government Information Quarterly|2003|20|4|389-394|10.1016/j.giq.2003.08.001|pub.1009664461|269;[Dawes, Sharon S; Pardo, Theresa A; Cresswell, Anthony M]|[ur.011614341055.31; ur.012053623220.70; ur.015070517706.01]|Government Information Quarterly|2004|21|1|3-23|10.1016/j.giq.2003.11.001|pub.1012556350|71;[Reddick, Christopher G.]|[ur.07774604557.93]|Government Information Quarterly|2006|23|2|249-266|10.1016/j.giq.2005.11.006|pub.1013900959|25;[Ebrahim, Zakareya; Irani, Zahir]|[; ur.012462056043.16]|Business Process Management Journal|2005|11|5|589-611|10.1108/14637150510619902|pub.1013996034|399;[Al‐Mashari, Majed]|[ur.013737101627.99]|Benchmarking An International Journal|2007|14|2|172-185|10.1108/14635770710740378|pub.1014091250|20;[Meso, Peter; Datta, Pratim; Mbarika, Victor]|[ur.011164345533.13; ur.014541607227.93; ur.010076557303.64]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2005|57|2|186-197|10.1002/asi.20263|pub.1014276144|30;[Krishna, S.; Walsham, Geoff]|[ur.016327507365.19; ur.012623025165.11]|Information Technology for Development|2005|11|2|123-140|10.1002/itdj.20007|pub.1014660710|93;[Madon, Shirin]|[ur.011405200023.39]|Information Technology and People|2000|13|2|85-101|10.1108/09593840010339835|pub.1016704711|143;[Steyaert, Jo]|[]|Social Science Computer Review|2000|18|1|3-16|10.1177/089443930001800101|pub.1017317692|48;[Gallivan, Michael J.]|[ur.010714153111.96]|Proceedings of the 1996 ACM SIGCPR/SIGMIS conference on Computer personnel research  - SIGCPR '96|1996|||313-325|10.1145/238857.238913|pub.1018681750|6;[Schware, Robert; Deane, Arsala]|[ur.015522712605.05; ]|Info|2003|5|4|10-19|10.1108/14636690310495193|pub.1018790699|48;[Snellen, Ignace]|[ur.012422701177.19]|International Review of Administrative Sciences|2002|68|2|183-198|10.1177/0020852302682002|pub.1019759785|63;[Carter, Lemuria; Bélanger, France]|[ur.010501313522.42; ur.07347634165.87]|Information Systems Journal|2005|15|1|5-25|10.1111/j.1365-2575.2005.00183.x|pub.1020923035|1145;[Lucas, Henry C.; Spitler, V.K.]|[ur.012073017461.45; ur.010343202263.14]|Decision Sciences|1999|30|2|291-311|10.1111/j.1540-5915.1999.tb01611.x|pub.1023696338|306;[Bertot, John Carlo]|[ur.011253735727.32]|Government Information Quarterly|2003|20|2|185-191|10.1016/s0740-624x(03)00036-4|pub.1027199920|96;[Bertot, John Carlo; McClure, Charles R.; Owens, Kimberly A.]|[ur.011253735727.32; ur.011622741644.06; ]|Government Information Quarterly|1999|16|4|309-327|10.1016/s0740-624x(00)86837-9|pub.1028405693|12;[Irkhin, Iu.

The Qatari government has launched the free wireless Internet parks concept under their national electronic government (e-government) initiative with a view to providing free Internet access for all citizens whilst enjoying the outdoors. By offering free wireless internet access, the Qatari government hopes to increase the accessibility of e-government services and encourage their citizens to actively participate in the global information society with a view to bridging the digital divide. The adoption and diffusion of iPark services will depend on user acceptance and the availability of wireless technology. This article examines an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) that proposes individual differences and technology complexity in order to determine perceived usefulness and perceived ease of the iPark initiative by using a survey-based study.

Currently, users of search engines may experience differences in their level of success in searching for information. This difference could be realized through search success or search strategies. However, there is currently no definitive explanation regarding the characteristics that influence differences in search engine use and behavior. This chapter will serve asan introduction to and explore the phenomena of online Web searching and the potential role of individual differences in investigating this situation. An overview of the literature will be detailed as well as issues regarding how individual differences can be incorporated into this type of research.

pub.1027802538,10.1300/j120v37n78_10,The Enhanced and Changing Role of the Specialist Librarian,"Much like the role of other academic librarians, the education librarian's responsibilities are in a constant state of transition. Major factors contributing to these changes are demands being placed on teacher training programs in colleges of education, demands placed on teachers and administrators in the nation's schools, demographic shifts, globalization, declining accessibility of resources along with the digital divide, and, most of all, greater demands for accountability of student achievement at all levels of education. The work of the education librarian has become more integrated in the creation and access of knowledge both in the library profession, and education itself. Education librarians not only have close ties to school curriculum being taught but also with the preparation of preservice teachers, students enrolled in advanced graduate studies, and the education researcher.

The fact that developments so far have tended to favour the middle classes and increase the social divide is noted in the context of the UK government’s setting up of a Social Exclusion Unit with a remit to help improve government action across traditional departmental boundaries to combat this problem of social exclusion and the formation of Policy Action Teams (PATs), one of which (PAT15) has focussed upon ICTs. Their report ‘Closing the digital divide: information and communication technologies in deprived areas’ was published in March 2000 and announces a £252 million initiative to create 1000 new technology training centres in local neighbourhoods, with centres based in sports clubs, pubs, schools, houses and churches.

Design/methodology/approach Literature review and principal author's first‐hand experience of Koha (OSS) implementation in Provincial Assembly Libraries of Pakistan under Pakistan Legislative Strengthen Project of United States Agency for International Development provide the information and insight for this paper.   Findings Adoption of OSS in libraries is just at a beginning stage in Pakistan, and only a few organizations have so far made their first move in this direction. The major identified issues affecting OSS adoption in Pakistani libraries are: social (cultural) disparity, conceptual confusions, digital divide, lack of technological, financial, and human development.   Practical implications The paper will help decision makers plan OSS applications in their libraries.   Originality/value This is the first paper on the topic in Pakistan and explores the issues involved in OSS adoption in a comprehensive manner. The paper can provide understanding regarding adoption of OSS to professionals in Pakistani and other developing countries with similar environment.",The Electronic Library,2009,27,4,601-610,"Rafiq, Muhammad; Ameen, Kanwal","Government College University, Lahore; University of the Punjab",Pakistan; Pakistan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024961945,26,"[Ramzan, Muhammad]|[ur.015115011277.83]|The Electronic Library|2004|22|3|274-280|10.1108/02640470410541688|pub.1000846341|15;[Hedgebeth, Darius]|[ur.014357672745.15]|Vine|2007|37|3|284-294|10.1108/03055720710825618|pub.1017242145|13;[Ramzan, Muhammad]|[ur.015115011277.83]|The Electronic Library|2004|22|5|440-447|10.1108/02640470410561974|pub.1025849863|10;[Haider, Syed Jalaluddin]|[ur.014371244727.55]|The Bottom Line Managing Library Finances|2003|16|2|55-64|10.1108/08880450310473126|pub.1030281426|14;[Mahmood, Khalid; Hameed, Abdul; Haider, Syed Jalaluddin]|[ur.014707433500.07; ur.013672531627.41; ur.014371244727.55]|Libri|2005|55|2-3|131-139|10.1515/libr.2005.131|pub.1042649935|7;[Mahmood, Khalid M.]|[]|Program|1998|32|1|37-48|10.1108/eum0000000006896|pub.1052766290|4;[Bretthauer, David]|[]|Library Hi Tech News|2001|18|5||10.1108/lhtn.2001.23918eaf.002|pub.1061059301|9;[Shafique, Farzana; Mahmood, Khalid]|[ur.011672164403.36; ur.014707433500.07]|Information Development|2008|24|1|66-78|10.1177/0266666907087698|pub.1063795923|21;[Levesque, Michelle]|[]|First Monday|2004|9|4||10.5210/fm.v9i4.1137|pub.1072710919|17;[Ameen, Kanwal]|[ur.015651745521.62]|Journal of Education for Library and Information Science|2006|47|3|200|10.2307/40323830|pub.1102296046|24"
pub.1024407831,10.1177/0276146708325381,Infotransformation of Markets,"Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are a driving force behind major economic, social, and cultural shifts from the modern to the postmodern, from local to global markets, from production to consumption, and from industrial to informational economies. While much has been written about the relationship between marketing and technology, most of the work regards marketing as an a priori category onto which new technologies are simply overlaid as they come along. These instrumentalist—functionalist views of ICTs in marketing are not particularly well suited when—as in macromarketing— the focus is on marketing systems and consumption systems. The present collection of articles provides one of the most insightful one-stop learning shops of the changing character of markets in the information age. From the fractal views of the ethical economy and its emergent collaborative production-provisioning-consumption system to the realities of the persistent digital divide in the age of the mobile phone, articles in this issue touch on important elements of marketing in the age of information.

Information Technology (IT) was viewed as a potential tool to bridge this ‘digital divide’. With reliable and cost effective access to the Internet, a significant body of health-related information would be accessible to users in developing and transitional countries. Currently, most of the information is produced in industrialized countries. Within sub-Saharan Africa, access to this information is limited. In 2002, the computer to user's ratio was 1:250-400 compared to a 1:15 world average and a 1:2 industrialized country average. Although there are examples of excellent projects, progress has been patchy, with the sub-Saharan Africa region falling behind due to the lack of physical access to information and training. Without the creation of a major organization with ample funding, pockets of progress will continue to be made, but the full potential of IT will not be reached.",Information Development,2006,22,4,242-251,"Rhine, Lenny",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018107783,6,"[Horton, Richard]|[ur.01372435713.34]|The Lancet|2000|355|9222|2231-2236|10.1016/s0140-6736(00)02414-4|pub.1022374423|156;[Godlee, Fiona; Pakenham-Walsh, Neil; Ncayiyana, Dan; Cohen, Barbara; Packer, Abel]|[ur.0675461762.55; ur.01257654434.74; ur.01061606324.19; ; ur.0607650136.33]|The Lancet|2004|364|9430|295-300|10.1016/s0140-6736(04)16681-6|pub.1024242081|145;[OMOLE, DUNCAN WAMBOGO]|[ur.012706005163.63]|The International Information & Library Review|2001|33|2-3|221-248|10.1006/iilr.2001.0171|pub.1040560630|3;[Lancet, The]|[]|The Lancet|2004|364|9430|222|10.1016/s0140-6736(04)16685-3|pub.1042900873|2;[Volmink, Jimmy; Dare, Lola]|[ur.0710630411.53; ur.01165213076.25]|The BMJ|2005|331|7519|705|10.1136/bmj.331.7519.705|pub.1044582963|77;[Addo, Hillar]|[ur.016573500553.96]|IFLA Journal|2001|27|3|143-151|10.1177/034003520102700306|pub.1047183869|8;[Geyoushi, Bohaira E.; Matthews, Zoë; Stones, R.

Previous studies have demonstrated the PHR's potential to alleviate limitations in traditional healthcare delivery. However, this type of technology-dependent approach inherits the vulnerabilities of exposing the society to its own share of inequality (i.e., “digital divide”). To address these concerns and improve healthcare outcomes, we have developed a web-based patient-centered electronic PHR, named the Personal Health Information Management System (PHIMS), and a community-based resource sharing and support model/strategy. The system has been evaluated at the Everett Housing Authority, which provides housing for low-income families and elderly or disabled populations, and we conducted a feasibility trial with the elderly and disabled residents. The participants were satisfied with the PHIMS system in general. 82% of the surveyed users attempted to share the PHIMS records with their care providers. Both patients and providers were satisfied with the usability of PHIMS.","1st Transdisciplinary Conference on Distributed Diagnosis and Home Healthcare, 2006.

pub.1070759307,10.2457/srs.38.991,Conditions Contributing to the Success of the Japanese Telecom Policy over the Past Five Decades,"The Japanese telecom market is presently one of the most advanced and dynamic in the world. This is the result of carefully planned development in Japanese telecom policies that have taken advantage of the external conditions of the times in Japan over the past 50 years or more. This article aims to clarify the contributing conditions based on the decades of experience in Japanese telecom policies and to determine the cross-country applicability of these policies. Based on the overall economic and market conditions during this period and considering the development of the Japanese telecom market to date, a set of contributing conditions are proposed. Statistical verifications for the general applicability of such conditions revealed that some hold true in the sampled Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations. The most important finding is that the market dominance of the incumbent operator has a significant impact on basic telecom development. Another part of the findings showed conformity with the “digital divide” between rich and poor nations. br<>JEL classification: L96, L98, O33",Studies in Regional Science,2008,38,4,991-1005,"JITSUZUMI, Toshiya",Kyushu University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070759307,0,"[Gruber, Harald; Verboven, Frank]|[ur.015777374105.67; ur.016512144251.48]|European Economic Review|2001|45|3|577-588|10.1016/s0014-2921(00)00068-4|pub.1000268382|262;[Ros, Agustin J.]|[ur.016306013327.18]|Journal of Regulatory Economics|1999|15|1|65-92|10.1023/a:1008048924876|pub.1006181193|160;[Distaso, Walter; Lupi, Paolo; Manenti, Fabio M.]|[ur.014724466756.32; ur.011163534041.98; ur.016205366663.91]|Information Economics and Policy|2006|18|1|87-106|10.1016/j.infoecopol.2005.07.002|pub.1007753105|161;[Polykalas, Spyros E.; Vlachos, Kyriakos G.]|[ur.016665534505.70; ur.01014347207.14]|Info|2006|8|6|15-30|10.1108/14636690610707464|pub.1011212800|10;[Rodrı́guez–Andrés, Antonio; Pérez–Amaral, Teodosio]|[; ur.011401642543.02]|Information Economics and Policy|1998|10|4|501-514|10.1016/s0167-6245(98)00016-x|pub.1012291089|4;[Grilli, Luca]|[ur.015513507155.20]|Telecommunications Policy|2004|28|3-4|295-308|10.1016/j.telpol.2004.01.002|pub.1013673397|2;[Gruber, Harald; Verboven, Frank]|[ur.015777374105.67; ur.016512144251.48]|International Journal of Industrial Organization|2001|19|7|1189-1212|10.1016/s0167-7187(01)00069-8|pub.1014981679|175;[Mariscal, Judith]|[ur.07365701451.47]|Telecommunications Policy|2005|29|5-6|409-428|10.1016/j.telpol.2005.03.004|pub.1015198978|80;[Botelho, Anabela; Pinto, Lı́gia Costa]|[ur.013014364141.64; ]|Telecommunications Policy|2004|28|5-6|427-437|10.1016/j.telpol.2003.11.006|pub.1016302705|53;[Laffont, Jean-Jacques; Rey, Patrick; Tirole, Jean]|[ur.013432030165.15; ur.013510766103.03; ur.014227410565.23]|European Economic Review|1997|41|3-5|701-711|10.1016/s0014-2921(97)00031-7|pub.1018752014|31;[Lee, Minkyu; Cho, Youngsang]|[; ur.015236460711.22]|Applied Economics Letters|2007|14|7|477-481|10.1080/13504850500461431|pub.1024614655|46;[Milne, Claire]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1998|22|9|775-780|10.1016/s0308-5961(98)00045-7|pub.1029376354|29;[Cava-Ferreruela, Inmaculada; Alabau-Muñoz, Antonio]|[; ]|Telecommunications Policy|2006|30|8-9|445-463|10.1016/j.telpol.2005.12.002|pub.1033740270|89;[LaRose, Robert; Gregg, Jennifer L.; Strover, Sharon; Straubhaar, Joseph; Carpenter, Serena]|[ur.0634303551.63; ur.013374314045.57; ur.012341524001.11; ur.010032516101.93; ]|Telecommunications Policy|2007|31|6-7|359-373|10.1016/j.telpol.2007.04.004|pub.1043510313|158;[Jang, Show-Ling; Dai, Shau-Chi; Sung, Simona]|[ur.014201534541.25; ; ur.014111353232.67]|Information Economics and Policy|2005|17|2|133-148|10.1016/j.infoecopol.2004.05.001|pub.1047013128|56;[Flynn, Roderick; Preston, Paschal]|[ur.011357500503.19; ur.010720410302.09]|Telecommunications Policy|1999|23|5|437-457|10.1016/s0308-5961(99)00023-3|pub.1049192262|5;[Wallsten, Scott J.]|[ur.01036474127.82]|Journal of Industrial Economics|2001|49|1|1-19|10.1111/1467-6451.00135|pub.1050852865|286;[Gruber, Harald]|[ur.015777374105.67]|Information Economics and Policy|2001|13|1|19-34|10.1016/s0167-6245(00)00028-7|pub.1053125981|159;[Fink, Carsten; Mattoo, Aaditya; Rathindran, Randeep]|[ur.014324654347.78; ur.012674551767.03; ur.01314631625.26]|Information Economics and Policy|2003|15|4|443-466|10.1016/s0167-6245(03)00007-6|pub.1053225894|91;[Solvason, D.Lynn]|[ur.011355173601.50]|Information Economics and Policy|1997|9|3|241-264|10.1016/s0167-6245(97)00004-8|pub.1053245988|10;[Röller, Lars-Hendrik; Waverman, Leonard]|[ur.015270256445.92; ur.015703454717.79]|American Economic Review|2001|91|4|909-923|10.1257/aer.91.4.909|pub.1064527330|927;[Griliches, Zvi]|[]|Econometrica|1957|25|4|501|10.2307/1905380|pub.1069635738|1917;[Squire, Lyn]|[]|The RAND Journal of Economics|1973|4|2|515|10.2307/3003051|pub.1102129289|59;[Artle, Roland; Averous, Christian]|[; ]|The RAND Journal of Economics|1973|4|1|89|10.2307/3003140|pub.1102129308|83;[von Rabenau, Burckhard; Stahl, Konrad]|[; ]|The RAND Journal of Economics|1974|5|2|651|10.2307/3003127|pub.1102129350|21;[Rohlfs, Jeffrey]|[]|The RAND Journal of Economics|1974|5|1|16|10.2307/3003090|pub.1102129355|626"

It involves developing the adaptive agent model and architecture for the tool as well as researching its effectiveness for the users. The potential users for this system are not only naïve about computer driven technology but are also inhibited to try one, which is a consequence of digital divide. They have not experienced a technology-driven environment where computer has become just another tool to mechanize the daily lives. In this respect they are disenfranchised and they belong to the segment that falls under Poor America. Naturally, handing over another search system will not bridge the divide or empower the disenfranchised users. In order to help them overcome the inhibition, this tool has to be, at the very least, easy to use. Therefore as part of the solution, an adaptive, agent-driven search system is being developed. The system will adapt and personalize the process of search to support individual goals and social needs.",ACM SIGCAPH Computers and the Physically Handicapped,2003,,75,7-8,"Chatterjee, Mousumi",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050248115,0,"[Lang, Ken]|[]|Machine Learning Proceedings 1995|1995|||331-339|10.1016/b978-1-55860-377-6.50048-7|pub.1002050789|1024;[Jettmar, Eva; Nass, Clifford]|[ur.016465775675.45; ur.011010152733.35]|Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems Changing our world, changing ourselves - CHI '02|2002|||129-134|10.1145/503376.503400|pub.1004895765|8;[Selker, Ted]|[ur.012567426031.59]|Communications of the ACM|1994|37|7|92-99|10.1145/176789.176799|pub.1007088674|111;[Trumbly, James E.; Arnett, Kirk P.; Johnson, Peter C.]|[ur.012721432166.17; ur.012212062074.25; ]|International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|1994|40|1|63-81|10.1006/ijhc.1994.1004|pub.1050833551|14;[Marchionini, G.; Shneiderman, B.]|[ur.012405116227.61; ur.013052653253.13]|Computer|1988|21|1|70-80|10.1109/2.222119|pub.1061105216|327"

As the digital divide seems to grow, the question becomes how will developing countries catch up? We examine two large developing countries, China and India, in an attempt to understand their approaches to developing e-business. While both countries had access to the technology at about the same time, each has taken a different path to utilizing it. These approaches are based on a number of factors, including government initiatives and focus, infrastructure building, experience and understanding of business operations, and culture, among others. China appears to be ahead of India in the mechanics and infrastructure, but India is ahead in e-readiness. Both countries are poised for rapidly increasing e-business, however, they have huge problems of poverty and inequality between urban and rural connectivity must be resolved to really take advantage of e-business.",Electronic Government,2008,,,3014-3032,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Raven, Peter V.; Huang, Xiaoqing; Kim, Ben B.",Seattle University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021897611,0,

The likelihood of internet engagement has been shown in previous work to rapidly decrease with age, and patterns of disengagement are most pronounced amongst older people. The study comprises a qualitative investigation consisting of observation and interviews conducted within a programme of internet literacy workshops funded by the Welsh Assembly Government. The reflection of previous research with data collected has led to the development of a model of older people's internet engagement. This model helps us better understand the context for patterns of engagement and disengagement with the internet. The model of internet engagement is used to highlight a number of strategies that should be considered in future policy intervention in the area of digital inclusion. The model described offers a more sophisticated instrument for understanding the issue of the digital divide amongst this excluded group and potentially may be applied more generally in understanding the complex nature of this issue.",Information Technology and People,2008,21,3,244-266,"Hill, Rebecca; Beynon‐Davies, Paul; Williams, Michael D.",Swansea University; Cardiff University,United Kingdom; United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1012062984,80,"[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|New Media & Society|2004|6|3|341-362|10.1177/1461444804042519|pub.1003317453|630;[Atkinson, MaryAnne; Kydd, Christine]|[ur.012711645467.22; ur.014304606467.90]|ACM SIGMIS Database the DATABASE for Advances in Information Systems|1997|28|2|53-62|10.1145/264701.264705|pub.1011556052|255;[Klobas, Jane E.; Clyde, Laurel A.]|[ur.015472574537.43; ur.010233370347.00]|Library Management|2001|22|1/2|61-68|10.1108/01435120110358943|pub.1012207466|17;[Kottak, Conrad Phillip]|[ur.01051625102.26]|Social Science Computer Review|1996|14|1|10-15|10.1177/089443939601400103|pub.1012222403|6;[Bandura, Albert]|[ur.01227557742.29]|Psychological Review|1977|84|2|191-215|10.1037/0033-295x.84.2.191|pub.1013429194|30960;[Beck, Eevi; Madon, Shirin; Sahay, Sundeep]|[; ur.011405200023.39; ur.012234426741.58]|The Information Society|2004|20|4|279-290|10.1080/01972240490481009|pub.1014337209|19;[Prensky, Marc]|[ur.010351560201.91]|On the Horizon The International Journal of Learning Futures|2001|9|6|1-6|10.1108/10748120110424843|pub.1022272567|982;[Prensky, Marc]|[ur.010351560201.91]|On the Horizon The International Journal of Learning Futures|2001|9|5|1-6|10.1108/10748120110424816|pub.1022939366|6303;[Trocchia, Philip J.; Janda, Swinder]|[ur.013224164307.21; ur.015671210241.38]|Journal of Consumer Marketing|2000|17|7|605-616|10.1108/07363760010357804|pub.1024214153|113;[Weightman, David; McDonagh, Deana]|[ur.0772541773.16; ur.01103021422.34]|Proceedings of the 2003 international conference on Designing pleasurable products and interfaces  - DPPI '03|2003|||34-39|10.1145/782896.782905|pub.1026014187|17;[Osman, Zaheer; Poulson, David; Nicolle, Colette]|[ur.011256674260.66; ur.014236733731.73; ur.0717062260.82]|Universal Access in the Information Society|2005|4|1|16-23|10.1007/s10209-005-0111-8|pub.1041096628|25;[ROSEN, LARRY D.; WEIL, MICHELLE M.]|[ur.016071071571.12; ur.016530224677.04]|Journal of Consumer Affairs|1995|29|1|55-84|10.1111/j.1745-6606.1995.tb00039.x|pub.1043973177|54;[Millward, Peter]|[ur.010411317705.13]|First Monday|2003|8|7||10.5210/fm.v8i7.1066|pub.1072710859|95;[Nahm, E S; Resnick, B]|[ur.012234142657.94; ur.011107224237.97]|CIN Computers Informatics Nursing|2001|19|6|257-63||pub.1074968809|38;[Olphert, C.

However, a number of developing countries are striving to narrow this gap by enriching their societies through the introduction of ICT based business activities. Knowledge management and E‐learning are examples of such ICT supported activities. Knowledge management applications are aimed to provide organizations with tools to manage their business knowledge, while the focus of e‐learning has always been on managing the delivery of academic knowledge. Efforts to integrate both areas of research are lacking. This paper presents a knowledge management approach for e‐learning applications. It highlights the joint characteristics of the two concepts and proposes a KM view of e‐learning.

We expect 3.3 billion of Smartphones in 2015; Google just announced mid November 2010 that their Nexus “S” smartphones will be NFC (Near Field Communication, [1], [2], [3]) by the end of 2010. This changes drastically the landscape of information service engineering. RFID tags and NFC standard in cell phones will be cornerstone of the ICT future in this new paradigm of “local wide web”: “Smart objects with smart phones on…smart LOCAL places is a summary of our digital future; digital divide will not be on infrastructure but on SERVICES” [5]. In this paper we give an overview of a portfolio of NFC innovative services prototyped at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis since the inception of the standard in 2004, infer some architectural and economics lessons, and propose a key research contribution based upon a genuine generic framework for multi-mode NFC applications within a SIM card.",2011 Third International Workshop on Near Field Communication,2011,,,3-8,"Miranda, Serge; Pastorelly, Nicolas",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095473015,15,"[Resatsch, Florian]|[ur.012470527451.04]||2010||||10.1007/978-3-8349-8683-2|pub.1005732114|13"

By drawing on an Australian and New Zealand survey sample (n = 406) of health Internet users, this article expands the field. It explores factors associated with a series of e-mail and Internet use behaviors including use of e-mail to communicate with doctors, presenting Internet information to doctors, perceptions of Internet information reliability, and checking of web site credentials. Regression results reveal a digital divide within the Internet using population; that those who e-mail doctors believe this improves communications; that more frequent Internet searchers had higher odds of finding information not previously provided by their doctor, and of taking Internet information to their doctor; that those expressing difficulty communicating with doctors had higher odds of believing Internet information to be more useful; and that older respondents were more likely to perceive Internet information to be reliable, yet less likely to check web site provider credentials.

E-Commerce based on IT and networking results in paradigm shift in Northeast Asian Nations, that is, Korea, China, Japan, Taiwan etc. There are the similarities and differences in e-Commerce situations in these nations. The differences are the gaps in e-Commerce infrastructures such as Internet, e-Commerce solution, e-payment system and e-logistics system etc. A number of interorganizational, intraorganizational and usage level factors influences the performances of all firms using e-Commerce tools. As result of this empirical study, China records low level of e-Commerce in terms of environmental aspects, usage and performance while Korea and Japan record relatively high levels. It is also found that non-economic performance is higher than economic performance in Northeast Asian firms. The purpose of this paper contributes to resolve the digital divide in Northeast Asia and to improve e-Commerce infrastructures in Northeast Asia by estimating current e-Commerce levels of Northeast Asian countries and suggesting future development strategies of those countries through e-Commerce cooperation.",International Commerce and Information Review,2008,10,1,3-31,ChoiSeokBeom; 최혁준,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1051182020,0,[최석범; 박경희; 이영찬]|[ur.015606736417.83; ; ]|Korea International Commercial Review|2007|22|2|247-268|10.18104/kaic.22.2.200706.247|pub.1044789504|4;[]|[]|Endeavour|1983|7|2|55|10.1016/s0160-9327(83)80001-5|pub.1051999903|9
pub.1042945103,10.1177/0020852307085736,The use of service channels by citizens in the Netherlands: implications for multi-channel management,"Many governmental organizations are changing their service channel management strategies to multi-channel management. However, very few empirical studies exist that explore how these multi-channel strategies should be shaped. In this article we test a number of hypotheses on citizens' channel use behaviour and the determinants of this behaviour. Further, we take into account the differences between citizens with and without a personal computer. In our conclusions we call for multi-channel strategies that do not only incorporate the features of service channels and the front—back office integration, but also deal with personal characteristics and task characteristics. Further, digital divide issues still influence channel usage by citizens, so it is necessary to keep all channels open for citizens. Finally, our study reveals that multi-channelling is a very complex subject on which research is still in its infancy. Points for practitioners • Multi-channel management may benefit most from channel integration. • Channels have different characteristics that render them suitable for different (parts of) services. • Computer `have-nots' still rely on traditional service channels, so these should remain accessible.",International Review of Administrative Sciences,2008,74,1,95-110,"Pieterson, Willem; Ebbers, Wolfgang",University of Twente,Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042945103,68,"[Black, Nancy Jo; Lockett, Andy; Ennew, Christine; Winklhofer, Heidi; McKechnie, Sally]|[ur.012162455015.99; ur.013176776573.49; ur.014666300011.12; ur.014315744305.73; ur.012762744657.30]|International Journal of Bank Marketing|2002|20|4|161-173|10.1108/02652320210432945|pub.1012368358|178;[Lee, Jinkook]|[ur.01313210556.44]|Journal of Services Marketing|2002|16|3|238-258|10.1108/08876040210427227|pub.1014022306|77;[van Dijk, Jan A.G.M.]|[ur.016570250333.33]|Poetics|2006|34|4-5|221-235|10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004|pub.1014130665|741;[Balasubramanian, Sridhar; Raghunathan, Rajagopal; Mahajan, Vijay]|[ur.010020707767.06; ur.016370472561.41; ur.011344150523.25]|Journal of Interactive Marketing|2005|19|2|12-30|10.1002/dir.20032|pub.1029710015|298;[Reddick, Christopher G.]|[ur.07774604557.93]|Government Information Quarterly|2005|22|1|38-57|10.1016/j.giq.2004.10.003|pub.1035661478|328;[Chen, Yu-Che; Dimitrova, Daniela V.]|[ur.013172643641.64; ur.014237167607.22]|International Journal of Electronic Government Research|2006|2|1|54-76|10.4018/jegr.2006010104|pub.1041598746|34;[Noble, Stephanie M.; Griffith, David A.; Weinberger, Marc G.]|[ur.012777741005.39; ur.013441435413.38; ur.016452317065.54]|Journal of Business Research|2005|58|12|1643-1651|10.1016/j.jbusres.2004.10.005|pub.1049283549|161;[Kwast, Myron L.; Starr-McCluer, Martha; Wolken, John D.]|[ur.016353300707.55; ur.016161761231.87; ]|The Antitrust Bulletin|1997|42|4|973-995|10.1177/0003603x9704200405|pub.1049527988|125;[Dugdale, Anni; Daly, Anne; Papandrea, Franco; Maley, Maria]|[ur.014534771635.48; ur.012364130477.62; ur.016171516463.30; ur.07657064211.52]|International Review of Administrative Sciences|2005|71|1|109-118|10.1177/0020852305051687|pub.1053069635|79;[Thomas, J.

pub.1042579834,10.1162/rest.88.2.336,The Impact of Internet Subsidies in Public Schools,"In an effort to alleviate the perceived growth of a digital divide, the U.S. government enacted a major subsidy for Internet and communications investment in schools starting in 1998. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of the subsidyknown as the E-Rateon Internet investment in California public schools. The program subsidized spending by 20%90%, depending on school characteristics. Using new data on school technology usage in every school in California from 1996 to 2000 as well as application data from the E-Rate program, the results indicate that the subsidy did succeed in significantly increasing Internet investment. The implied first-dollar price elasticity of demand for Internet investment is between 0.4 and 1.1 and the greatest sensitivity is seen among urban schools and schools with large black and Hispanic student populations. Rural and predominantly white and Asian schools show much less sensitivity. Overall, by the final year of the sample, there were approximately 68% more Internet-connected classrooms per teacher than there would have been without the subsidy. Using a variety of test score results, however, we do not find significant effects of the E-Rate program, at least so far, on student performance.",The Review of Economics and Statistics,2006,88,2,336-347,"Goolsbee, Austan; Guryan, Jonathan",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042579834,145,"[Angrist, Joshua; Lavy, Victor]|[ur.01204521414.55; ur.01067370365.51]|The Economic Journal|2002|112|482|735-765|10.1111/1468-0297.00068|pub.1008097573|223;[Krueger, A.

To better assess the impact of the Internet, it is important to understand the pattern of its diffusion. Using the Current Population Survey, this paper examines the diffusion process of the Internet between 1994 and 2007. The CPS provides seven cross-sectional data sets on Internet use over the period, four of which are spaced close enough to be turned into panel data sets. Simple trend analyses show that a logistic S-curve fits the seven observations very well, and that the diffusion took off around the time when the graphical user interface was introduced. Findings from multivariate trend analyses and panel data analyses include; (1) the digital divide is not likely to be closed in the near future, (2) exposure to the technology at school and workplace are important factors of initial and continued use of the Internet, and (3) of different online activities, email use is the most important predictor of continued use, implying that the diffusion process is highly social, rather than individualistic.",Social Science Research,2011,40,2,602-613,"Kim, Sangmoon",University of North Carolina Wilmington,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013094326,27,"[Hampton, Keith N.; Wellman, Barry]|[ur.012317624303.24; ur.011001756750.07]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2000|1765||194-208|10.1007/3-540-46422-0_16|pub.1018309625|98;[Wellman, Barry; Salaff, Janet; Dimitrova, Dimitrina; Garton, Laura; Gulia, Milena; Haythornthwaite, Caroline]|[ur.011001756750.07; ur.015143557616.36; ur.014633526654.41; ur.010556713626.90; ur.0627653246.14; ur.013446276022.87]|Annual Review of Sociology|1996|22|1|213-238|10.1146/annurev.soc.22.1.213|pub.1018520044|739;[Zillien, Nicole; Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.0700150321.71; ur.014036273417.00]|Social Science Quarterly|2009|90|2|274-291|10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x|pub.1022503348|384;[MARKUS, M.

After that, under the framework of the Brazilian context, we will discuss the expansion of the Internet in opposition to the issue of digital divide, focusing on the costs of obtaining information by asymmetrically empowered groups. Finally, in a case study, we will provide a critical analysis of a regional agency, responsible for the implementation of the experience of e-government on the Rio de Janeiro State, considered here as a proxy of the Brazilian case.

From the public administration perspective, obviously, NPM is also a force underpinning the e-governance. In the early 1980s, G. Caiden described that administrative reform came of age. Under the Thatcherism and Reaganism, the core values of government reform are entrepreneurship and competition, and these will be helpful to the formation of E-government. In this paper, some points will be discussed. First, the formation of the society of Information under the development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Second, the transformation of public service delivery in e-government context and the approach of New Public Management (NPM), and of course, the issues of equality, such as digital divide, and digital democracy will also be discussed under the context.

A cost-efficient and service-oriented deployment of Informaton and Communications Technologies (ICTs) helps to reduce the so-called “digital divide”, improving the productivity and quality of life of those communities. Mobile communications have settled down a foundation for the development of new and rich network applications which are particularly attractive as digital inclusion tools for rural environments, where they can be deployed with comparative simplicity and reduced cost. In this paper we propose the Rural Ambient Network (RAN), an architecture for wireless networks specially designed for digital inclusion enabling global optimization of resource utilization using the Community Cost metric. This architecture uses a policy-based management framework for the integration of heterogeneous technologies in a common network control space. We also present a RAN prototype which uses mesh networking as a key technology; several scenarios involving policy-based decision-making have been tested on this infrastructure. Our early results show that RAN augments the native routing capabilities of the underlying technologies.",2007 First International Global Information Infrastructure Symposium,2007,,,20-26,"Grampín, Eduardo; Baliosian, Javier; Visca, Jorge; Giachino, Martín; Vidal, Leonardo",University of the Republic,Uruguay,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095025356,2,"[Kappler, Cornelia; Mendes, Paulo; Prehofer, Christian; Pöyhönen, Petteri; Zhou, Di]|[ur.013002342174.74; ur.013601102351.54; ur.010357243342.39; ur.015174602655.75; ur.07642726705.73]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2005|3457||139-151|10.1007/11520184_11|pub.1052189577|25;[Gupta, P.; Kumar, P.R.]|[ur.014075604365.52; ur.07654411041.17]|IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|2000|46|2|388-404|10.1109/18.825799|pub.1061101255|6104"
pub.1072794216,10.5367/000000003322776316,Electronic Training at the Corporate Level in Egypt,"Declining revenue, staff downsizing and limited resources in corporations create serious organizational challenges. Training and human resources departments are often among the most adversely affected. Training managers are left with fewer resources with which to fulfil corporate training needs. Continuously having to justify costs and investments in training, they are often asked about the applicability and effectiveness of a particular project. Electronic training, a strategic human resource investment vehicle, is increasingly called into question in this context. But electronic training is expected to become a crucial factor in meeting the challenges of the rapidly changing world economy and enabling organizations to adapt to continuous change. While electronic training poses considerable challenges for organizations, especially in developing countries, it may also represent a unique opportunity to close the digital divide between developed and developing nations and to advance economic development. This paper is based on research conducted in Egypt to investigate the effectiveness and applicability of electronic training in Egyptian organizations and to identify how those organizations assess the role and implementation of electronic training. The researchers solicited views from training and human resources managers, instructors and trainees themselves.",Industry and Higher Education,2003,17,6,409-416,"Kamel, Sherif; Ibrahim, Mohamed",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072794216,3,"[Lau, Linda K.; Nguyen, Dat-Dao; Kira, Dennis S.]|[; ur.015012322141.97; ur.012613365063.34]|Distance Learning Technologies|2000|||22-38|10.4018/978-1-878289-80-3.ch003|pub.1026047761|6;[Lau, Linda K.; Meyer-Peyton, Lore]|[; ]|Distance Learning Technologies|2000|||82-90|10.4018/978-1-878289-80-3.ch007|pub.1036737903|3;[Lau, Linda K.; Schrum, Lynne]|[; ur.016350623473.50]|Distance Learning Technologies|2000|||91-106|10.4018/978-1-878289-80-3.ch008|pub.1043160742|24"

By providing a usage of e-Marketplace which based on Internet to SMEs as a basic tool, SMEs in Korea face to the business environment of the unlimited competition for e-Trade. To advance into the economic scale of developed countries, we need to expand the export of SMEs and these are required: a support of government about the e-Trade, an analysis about the supporting of current (e-Trade Company Programs) and a research about the evaluation. The purpose of the articles is that we analyze and classify a supporting system for the export by types and present the result and solution about a supporting system for the current (e-Trade Company Programs).

This is achieved through investigating the operation and the experience of a typical Rural Internet Centre. The findings of this study showed that there is keen interest among the community to learn and sharpen their ICT-related skills. The Internet Centre serves to provide an avenue for the realisation of this goal. The study showed that despite some operational snags, the Internet Centre performed well. One of the by-products of the centre was that its activities fostered closer relationships among users; it provided an avenue for disparate community members to interact and share their new skills. Bringing the ICT usage and appreciation to the rural areas was successful. About half of the centre users made weekly visits during which they searched for information on the internet, sent and received e-mail and attended the Internet Centre's regular IT classes. They also saw it as a valuable communication channel and a potential leveller of the technological capability gap.",International Journal of Innovation and Technology Management,2010,7,02,129-143,"SULAIMAN, AININ; JAAFAR, NOOR ISMAWATI; JANI, ROHANA",University of Malaya,Malaysia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063008429,0,"[Yusop, Nor Iadah; Mat Aji, Zahurin; Ibrahim, Huda; Abd.

This study is an attempt to clarify how some cognitive variables determine the interaction of cognitively impaired elderly people with technology. Main content Twenty participants ranging from mild cognitive impairment to moderate Alzheimer's disease were assessed by means of a neuropsychological and functional battery, and were asked to follow simple commands from an Avatar appearing on a TV by means of a remote control. Number of correct answers and command repetitions required for the user to respond were registered. Results Results show that participants with a better cognitive and functional state in specific tests show a significantly better performance in the TV task. Conclusion Neuropsychological assessment may be used to guide assistive technology developers in the adaptation of IT to the elderly with different cognitive and functional profiles.",Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments - PETRA '11,2011,,,8,"Díaz, Unai; Buiza, Cristina; Etxaniz, Aitziber; Urdaneta, Elena; González, Mari Feli; Yanguas, Javier",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046704072,1,"[Nygård, Louise]|[ur.01257403735.49]|Dementia|2008|7|4|481-502|10.1177/1471301208096631|pub.1002751836|54;[Salmon, David P.; Bondi, Mark W.]|[ur.01234022020.15; ur.01003345020.75]|Annual Review of Psychology|2009|60|1|257-282|10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190024|pub.1005185536|297;[Blackler, Alethea; Popovic, Vesna; Mahar, Doug]|[ur.01003552752.86; ur.01051666152.44; ur.011352317655.04]|Applied Ergonomics|2009|41|1|72-92|10.1016/j.apergo.2009.04.010|pub.1005304055|80;[Lu, Yueh-Feng Yvonne; Wykle, May]|[ur.01154032406.47; ur.01002757456.06]|Clinical Nursing Research|2007|16|1|29-43|10.1177/1054773806295238|pub.1012787943|43;[Moser, Ewald; Derntl, Birgit; Robinson, Simon; Fink, Bernhard; Gur, Ruben C.; Grammer, Karl]|[ur.0733730631.74; ur.0746522124.71; ur.0653501003.62; ur.01177664113.10; ur.015711353752.65; ur.01152770625.58]|Journal of Neuroscience Methods|2006|161|1|126-133|10.1016/j.jneumeth.2006.10.016|pub.1022934182|101;[Folstein, Marshal F.; Folstein, Susan E.; McHugh, Paul R.]|[ur.0735330504.84; ur.01071033744.61; ur.01203245430.40]|Journal of Psychiatric Research|1975|12|3|189-198|10.1016/0022-3956(75)90026-6|pub.1027523106|69882;[Topo, Päivi]|[ur.0631534106.54]|Journal of Applied Gerontology|2008|28|1|5-37|10.1177/0733464808324019|pub.1030739397|208;[Dyck, Miriam; Winbeck, Maren; Leiberg, Susanne; Chen, Yuhan; Gur, Rurben C.; Mathiak, Klaus]|[ur.01301763101.34; ur.0624472201.02; ur.01105541602.95; ur.01045455652.03; ; ur.01274654356.97]|PLOS ONE|2008|3|11|e3628|10.1371/journal.pone.0003628|pub.1034161262|77;[Carrasco, Eduardo; Epelde, Gorka; Moreno, Aitor; Ortiz, Amalia; Garcia, Igor; Buiza, Cristina; Urdaneta, Elena; Etxaniz, Aitziber; González, Mari Feli; Arruti, Andoni]|[ur.016264202275.35; ur.013467474223.83; ur.07717601231.40; ur.010016671120.68; ur.014403035121.18; ur.012566427521.93; ur.01064176357.52; ur.011703410317.06; ur.0703017610.54; ur.010245102473.57]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2008|5105||38-45|10.1007/978-3-540-70540-6_5|pub.1040555006|25;[Hanson, Elizabeth; Magnusson, Lennart; Arvidsson, Helene; Claesson, Anette; Keady, John; Nolan, Mike]|[ur.010437174405.54; ur.0632331322.84; ; ; ur.01233027442.22; ur.01164534475.21]|Dementia|2007|6|3|411-434|10.1177/1471301207081572|pub.1044128095|72;[Son, Juheui; Erno, Amy; Shea, Dennis G.; Femia, Elia E.; Zarit, Steven H.; Parris Stephens, Mary Ann]|[; ; ur.0652166272.86; ur.0742606414.08; ur.0735040232.37; ur.01167557723.75]|Journal of Aging and Health|2007|19|6|871-887|10.1177/0898264307308568|pub.1044445203|145;[Bertrand, Rosanna M.; Fredman, Lisa; Saczynski, Jane]|[ur.01364120024.41; ur.01014014236.31; ur.01100633332.16]|Journal of Aging and Health|2006|18|4|534-551|10.1177/0898264306289620|pub.1047849641|104;[SLEGERS, KARIN; VAN BOXTEL, MARTIN P.

The paper shows how people with the skills, time and confidence to navigate and manage the online chaos will gain access to new career opportunities, find audiences for their work and enrich the lives of others. Those without such initiative risk being marginalized or left behind.    Design  This work draws upon the results of an ongoing research project which is investigating the use of new technologies by entrepreneurs and small businesses in the South East of England.    Findings  The paper demonstrates how various online services such as blogging and social networking can be harnessed to develop and enhance a personal brand.    Practical implications  Finding a job and managing career progression increasingly involves understanding how today's networks work and how to deploy them effectively to build a personal brand, both online and offline.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the potential for e‐shopping to fill the vacuum and to assist disadvantaged shoppers.   Design/methodology/approach The paper uses prior published research to comment on the extent to which e‐retailing may be the shopping solution of the future?   Findings The internet has limited potential to compensate for shopping deserts, as consumers who do not have a good range of physical shops within walking distance also tend to lack access to the internet.   Research limitations/implications The paper is based solely on prior research. The authors recommend action research that may hopefully help excluded shoppers to become more included by addressing the problems of access to e‐shopping.

Wanquan County was chosen as the studied area, in where the research used questionnaire to survey the current situation of peasants’ demands for agricultural information, as well as the information delivery approaches. A questionnaire was developed and data were collected from 200 peasant households. The major content is focused on the demands for the information service of peasant households, as well as the supply mode of agricultural information acquisition. The survey shows the information dissemination is irregular and the channels of information acquisition are serious in poverty-stricken rural areas. Although there are different types of peasants’ demands for agricultural information, the utilization rate is low. Bridging the digital divide between urban and rural areas will be a major challenge for government in Wanquan County. On the basis of analysis, the research designs a local characteristic industry platform for the characteristic agriculture.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2011,345,,264-273,"Shi, Xiaoxia; Wu, Yongchang",Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences,China; China,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030921167,0,"[CUI, Yun-peng; Ping, QIAN; SUN, Su-fen; ZHANG, Jun-feng; LUO, Chang-shou]|[; ; ur.013135465337.78; ur.016365237362.10; ur.012743227274.60]|Journal of Integrative Agriculture|2008|7|2|248-256|10.1016/s1671-2927(08)60046-2|pub.1028535537|1;[Niederhauser, Norbert; Oberthür, Thomas; Kattnig, Sibylle; Cock, James]|[; ur.016072036021.00; ; ur.01100222646.49]|Computers and Electronics in Agriculture|2008|61|2|241-253|10.1016/j.compag.2007.12.001|pub.1031057910|24;[Assessment and Evaluation, European Initiative for Agricultural Research for Development Task Force on Impact]|[]|Agricultural Systems|2003|78|2|329-336|10.1016/s0308-521x(03)00132-x|pub.1040571407|18"
pub.1006544484,10.4018/978-1-60566-699-0.ch020,Broadband in America,"Under the Bush Administration, the U.S. failed to close the digital divide and fell behind on broadband. In 2001, 54 percent of households did not have the Internet. In late 2007, 49 percent of households did not have broadband. About 25 percent of households with incomes below $25,000 per year had broadband in 2007; whereas over 80 percent of households with incomes above $75,000 did. In 2001, the U.S. ranked third in the world in the penetration of broadband, but had fallen to 15th by 2007. A variety of measures of performance and econometric models that control for economic and social factors show a dozen nations are ahead of the U.S. The laissez faire policy pursued by the Bush administration let a duopoly of cable and telephone companies dribble out broadband at slow speed and high prices. In contrast, the nations that passed the U.S. implemented much more aggressive policies to promote broadband and instead of relying on weak intermodal competition, they required the dominant networks to be open to competition in Internet services. This kept the price down and stimulated adoption and innovation.",Handbook of Research on Overcoming Digital Divides,2010,,,359-384,"Ferro, Enrico; Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Gil-Garcia, J.

This will help bridge the digital divide, as these computer solutions will be closer to the local users. The project entails studying the community in question and understanding their way of life and then develop software solutions that use features that they are familiar with and use their language. The project will ask the community to partake in the development of the solution and then reap benefits from whatever revenue stream the project will enable. An added benefit is that we should be able to preserve the cultural aspects of the community while bringing forth best class modernity. Key areas that the project will affect are: education, music, artworks, written or documented history etc. Younger as well as future generations will have a chance to be inventive, innovative and hopefully become the future developers and develop their own software solutions.",2006 8th International Conference Advanced Communication Technology,2006,3,,2219-2222,"Ndlovu, Gary O.G; Terzoli, Alfredo; Petersen, Alvin; Muyingi, Hippolyte; Rao, G.

pub.1071884887,10.4018/jcit.2008070103,Free Wireless Internet Park Services: An Investigation of Technology Adoption in Qatar from a Citizens' Perspective,"This article examines the adoption of free wireless Internet parks (iPark) by Qatari citizens as a means of accessing electronic services from public parks. The Qatar government has launched the iPark concept with a view of providing free internet access for all citizens while enjoying the outdoors. This concept is enabled by an ICT infrastructure and broadband facilities which is considered as regional good practice. By offering free wireless Internet access, the Qatari government encourages its citizen’s to actively participate in the global information society with a view of bridging the digital divide. Using a survey based study this research set out to examine the Qatari citizens’ perceptions of the iPark initiative. Results of the survey showed that there is a positive level of relation between the independent variables, usefulness, ease of use, Internet safety, and Internet speed/response time and one dependent variable, intention to use the iPark in Qatar. The paper provides a discussion on the key findings, research implications, limitations, and future directions for the iPark initiative in Qatar.",Journal of Cases on Information Technology,2008,10,3,21-34,"Al-Shafi, Shafi",Brunel University London,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1071884887,15,"[Cheng, T.C.

For fourteen civil affairs service sites, 51 participants performed usability tests and post-test interviews. The results showed that even though the e-Government services are fairly attainable, it takes too many steps and long time for users to complete the given tasks. The overall success rate to complete the tasks on e-Government was 0.69 and it took more than 4 minutes and 12 page navigations on average to complete simple transactions. A strong digital divide could be observed in the use of e-Government services in that the users with different vocations and ages resulted in difference in perceived usability and actual performance. Results suggest that not only are there wide variations in the usability for the services provided, but that significant work still needs to be undertaken in order to make the services of the e-Government more usable, particularly for the older users.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2007,4556,,64-72,"Lee, Seongil; Cho, Joo Eun",Sungkyunkwan University; Kyungpook National University,South Korea; South Korea,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043127050,10,"[Palmer, Jonathan W.; Griffith, David A.]|[; ur.013441435413.38]|Communications of the ACM|1998|41|3|44-51|10.1145/272287.272296|pub.1020504505|157;[Vassilakis, Costas; Lepouras, George; Haston, Simon; Georgiadis, Panagiotis; Fraser, John]|[ur.012712243705.08; ur.012014454635.68; ur.07402623723.22; ur.011026145307.98; ur.011637350020.04]|e-Service Journal|2004|4|1|41-63|10.1353/esj.2006.0004|pub.1029744378|21;[Jarvenpaa, Sirrka L.; Todd, Peter A.]|[; ]|International Journal of Electronic Commerce|1996|1|2|59-88|10.1080/10864415.1996.11518283|pub.1039856679|969;[Seifert, Jeffrey W.; Relyea, Harold C.]|[; ]|Journal of E-Government|2004|1|1|7-15|10.1300/j399v01n01_02|pub.1064877973|19"
pub.1033463939,10.4018/jide.2010040102,Universal Broadband: An Analysis of Global Stakeholders and the Pursuit of the Common Good,"A new digital divide is emerging both within and between nations that is due to inequalities in broadband Internet access. To bridge the global broadband divide, organizations and individuals must collaborate to provide broadband access to a converged high-speed Internet for both rich and poor citizens worldwide. The authors argue that addressing this global problem is an ethical imperative that requires bridging the perspectives of multiple stakeholders and applying their collective resources, power and will. This paper develops a comprehensive framework, using stakeholder theory, which identifies the global stakeholders as well as the roles and responsibilities that these stakeholders must assume to balance their self-interest with serving the common good. The authors’ framework also highlights relationships between key stakeholders, namely governments and their citizens, businesses in the information and communication technology (ICT) industries, and other organizations. This paper makes four important observations that can guide governments and other stakeholders in bridging the broadband divide in pursuit of the common good.",International Journal of Innovation in the Digital Economy,2010,1,2,25-43,"Yates, David J.; Weiss, Joseph W.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033463939,3,"[Schech, Susanne]|[ur.015014714225.57]|Journal of International Development|2002|14|1|13-23|10.1002/jid.870|pub.1001709424|84;[Baliamoune‐Lutz, Mina]|[ur.07704711743.28]|Information Technology for Development|2003|10|3|151-169|10.1002/itdj.1590100303|pub.1004608331|204;[Marsden, Christopher T.]|[ur.011556506731.73]|Journal of Consumer Policy|2008|31|1|115-132|10.1007/s10603-007-9056-z|pub.1006322569|43;[Distaso, Walter; Lupi, Paolo; Manenti, Fabio M.]|[ur.014724466756.32; ur.011163534041.98; ur.016205366663.91]|Information Economics and Policy|2006|18|1|87-106|10.1016/j.infoecopol.2005.07.002|pub.1007753105|161;[Hudson, Heather E.]|[]||2006||||10.4324/9780203933138|pub.1008301167|33;[Beilock, Richard; Dimitrova, Daniela V]|[ur.014323447013.67; ur.014237167607.22]|Telecommunications Policy|2003|27|3-4|237-252|10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00100-3|pub.1010780120|140;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|Telecommunications Policy|1999|23|10-11|701-718|10.1016/s0308-5961(99)00050-6|pub.1014570506|228;[WADDOCK, SANDRA A.; GRAVES, SAMUEL B.]|[ur.016523236343.90; ur.012564732114.42]|Strategic Management Journal|1997|18|4|303-319|10.1002/(sici)1097-0266(199704)18:4<303::aid-smj869>3.0.co;2-g|pub.1026245427|3893;[Argandoña, Antonio]|[]|Journal of Business Ethics|1998|17|9-10|1093-1102|10.1023/a:1006075517423|pub.1026631713|258;[Zhao, Hongxin; Kim, Seung; Suh, Taewon; Du, Jianjun]|[ur.012127022247.01; ur.07676611102.37; ur.011271552102.18; ur.014440220447.51]|Journal of Global Information Management|2007|15|2|28-55|10.4018/jgim.2007040102|pub.1029296437|65;[Sawada, M.; Cossette, Daniel; Wellar, Barry; Kurt, Tolga]|[ur.01170373561.09; ur.014063416216.49; ur.012666705053.04; ]|Government Information Quarterly|2006|23|3-4|454-479|10.1016/j.giq.2006.08.003|pub.1037678688|36;[Robison, Kristopher Kyle; Crenshaw, Edward M.]|[ur.015334225726.82; ur.013127613411.61]|Social Science Research|2002|31|3|334-363|10.1016/s0049-089x(02)00004-2|pub.1047972798|76;[Frieden, Rob]|[ur.015661425013.94]|Telecommunications Policy|2005|29|8|595-613|10.1016/j.telpol.2005.06.002|pub.1048398926|100;[Forestier, Emmanuel; Grace, Jeremy; Kenny, Charles]|[; ur.07740001375.80; ur.010254167455.56]|Telecommunications Policy|2002|26|11|623-646|10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00061-7|pub.1050411674|78;[Pick, James B.; Azari, Rasool]|[ur.013153730431.66; ur.016636325747.37]|Information Technology for Development|2008|14|2|91-115|10.1002/itdj.20095|pub.1051270561|91;[Fuchs, Christian; Horak, Eva]|[ur.011011325200.42; ]|Telematics and Informatics|2008|25|2|99-116|10.1016/j.tele.2006.06.004|pub.1053315652|197;[Chinn, M.

pub.1028710073,10.1080/01972241003712231,Putting Digital Literacy in Practice: How Schools Contribute to Digital Inclusion in the Network Society,"In the sociology of childhood and youth, children have been conceptualized as passive subjects on hold, still in the process of becoming—rather than in an effective state of being. In effect, children have been conceptualized as the subjects rather than the objects of the research process. This influence got carried over to digital divide research. The latest thinking in the field has started to define and understand children and young people as heterogeneous, nonpassive, autonomous, diverse, and versatile agents actively appropriating the Internet in meaningful contexts of their everyday lives. This article seeks to move the discourse forward via four parallel binary logistic regressions that assess diverse and socially mediated opportunities needed to learn basic digital skills from a representative sample of 6,602 primary and secondary students from 350 schools and high schools in Catalonia, Spain. Our research shows that the school appears to be playing a secondary role, as compared with children and young people's social practice in heterogenic contexts of everyday life, not only for Internet training but also for providing opportunities to develop and master basic digital skills.",The Information Society,2010,26,3,197-208,"Meneses, Julio; Mominó, Josep Maria",Open University of Catalonia,Spain,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028710073,32,"[Bawden, David]|[]|Journal of Documentation|2001|57|2|218-259|10.1108/eum0000000007083|pub.1000197126|456;[Fairlie, Robert W]|[ur.015575246157.36]|Contributions in Economic Analysis & Policy|2004|3|1||10.2202/1538-0645.1263|pub.1001896093|143;[Livingstone, Sonia]|[ur.014400337707.47]|New Media & Society|2003|5|2|147-166|10.1177/1461444803005002001|pub.1003333651|238;[Gaziano, Cecilie]|[ur.011707047025.50]|Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly|1997|74|2|237-264|10.1177/107769909707400202|pub.1003442659|125;[Kent, N.; Facer, K.]|[; ur.01221066300.33]|Journal of Computer Assisted Learning|2004|20|6|440-455|10.1111/j.1365-2729.2004.00102.x|pub.1003514133|86;[Viswanath, K.; Finnegan, John R.]|[ur.0663643043.30; ur.01107637123.94]|Annals of the International Communication Association|1996|19|1|187-228|10.1080/23808985.1996.11678931|pub.1004116029|208;[Judge, Sharon; Puckett, Kathleen; Cabuk, Burcu]|[ur.0776236051.92; ur.013767037117.28; ur.014662674633.53]|Journal of Research on Technology in Education|2004|36|4|383-396|10.1080/15391523.2004.10782421|pub.1007090447|59;[Lievrouw, Leah A.; Farb, Sharon E.]|[ur.015617015543.53; ur.015052574702.41]|Annual Review of Information Science and Technology|2005|37|1|499-540|10.1002/aris.1440370112|pub.1007100288|79;[Facer, Keri; Furlong, John; Furlong, Ruth; Sutherland, Rosamund]|[ur.01221066300.33; ur.012574762017.25; ur.010506710607.53; ur.0654777270.81]|British Journal of Sociology of Education|2001|22|1|91-108|10.1080/01425690123324|pub.1008103719|38;[Qvortrup, Jens]|[]|Studies in Modern Childhood, Society, Agency, Culture|2005||||10.1057/9780230504929|pub.1009210798|81;[Johnson, Heather Beth]|[]|Advances in Life Course Research|2001|6||53-93|10.1016/s1040-2608(01)80007-1|pub.1012841771|14;[Lentz, R.G.]|[]|Info|2000|2|4|355-377|10.1108/14636690010801609|pub.1014492307|21;[Wilson, Kenneth R.; Wallin, Jennifer S.; Reiser, Christa]|[; ; ]|Social Science Computer Review|2003|21|2|133-143|10.1177/0894439303021002001|pub.1015934109|133;[Hindman, Douglas Blanks]|[ur.012531241453.88]|Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly|2000|77|3|549-560|10.1177/107769900007700306|pub.1016275694|99;[Lievrouw, Leah A.]|[ur.015617015543.53]|The Information Society|2000|16|2|155-159|10.1080/01972240050032924|pub.1016388422|27;[Jackson, Linda A.; Ervin, Kelly S.; Gardner, Philip D.; Schmitt, Neal]|[ur.01070755763.48; ur.011064071572.45; ur.016623651305.19; ur.015030215226.46]|Journal of Applied Social Psychology|2001|31|10|2019-2046|10.1111/j.1559-1816.2001.tb00162.x|pub.1018476267|52;[GAZIANO, CECILIE]|[ur.011707047025.50]|Communication Research|1983|10|4|447-486|10.1177/009365083010004003|pub.1018914207|134;[Valentine, Gill; Holloway, Sarah; Bingham, Nick]|[ur.010513355511.85; ur.011003521457.11; ur.0773262460.41]|Antipode|2002|34|2|296-315|10.1111/1467-8330.00239|pub.1020565681|44;[Cleary, Paul F.; Pierce, Glenn; Trauth, Eileen M.]|[ur.07511275703.18; ur.01313435504.02; ur.07421642022.90]|Universal Access in the Information Society|2005|4|4|354-373|10.1007/s10209-005-0001-0|pub.1030209961|29;[Wasserman, Ira M.; Richmond‐Abbott, Marie]|[ur.016416423144.28; ]|Social Science Quarterly|2005|86|1|252-270|10.1111/j.0038-4941.2005.00301.x|pub.1033277252|209;[Cooper, Joel; Weaver, Kimberlee D.]|[; ur.0770707336.29]||2003||||10.4324/9781410608932|pub.1034254512|181;[Facer, Keri; Furlong, Ruth]|[ur.01221066300.33; ur.010506710607.53]|Journal of Youth Studies|2001|4|4|451-469|10.1080/13676260120101905|pub.1036471466|105;[Prout, Alan]|[]||2004||||10.4324/9780203323113|pub.1041694382|448;[van Dijk, Jan; Hacker, Kenneth]|[; ]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|315-326|10.1080/01972240309487|pub.1047421245|709;[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|Media Culture & Society|2003|25|3|351-378|10.1177/0163443703025003004|pub.1053800515|69;[Coleman, James S.]|[]|American Journal of Sociology|1988|94||s95-s120|10.1086/228943|pub.1058548441|17531;[TICHENOR, P.

These technologies can create new types of economic activities, employment opportunities and enhance social interaction and networking among people. Access to basic telecommunications services is a basic right of the population of Malawi and telecommunications is one of the most important tools in reduction of poverty in rural areas. The government of Malawi established a pilot network of public access ICT facilities called Multipurpose Community Telecentres in rural areas with an aim of addressing the digital divide by providing universal access to basic ICT services in reasonable walking distances by establishing telecentres in strategically located positions. Pattern access and use of telecentre services varies across different socio-economic groups. It also depends on the service and the way its delivery is structured. Therefore, this paper discusses the utilisation of these ICTs in telecentres in rural areas in Malawi considering challenges and opportunities.","Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering",2011,64,,93-101,"Chikumba, Patrick Albert",University of Malawi,Malawi,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028543201,5,"[Colle, Royal D.]|[ur.015264140435.70]|The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries|2005|21|1|1-13|10.1002/j.1681-4835.2005.tb00133.x|pub.1099627917|28"

Those involved in the planning, development and implementation of the information systems that turn the Information Society into a reality are the custodians of the greatest change agent yet devised. They must recognise their social responsibilities and act accordingly for the benefit of society and its citizens. This chapter serves as an illustration of what types of social responsibility issues need to be addressed, who must address them and how they might be addressed. It discusses some of the basic aspects of social responsibility and the implications for the Information Society, drawing in particular from Corporate Social Responsibility. Five disparate cases illustrate how concepts are turned into real organisational policy.

IT also connects the machine environment with human applications, and has emerged as a force for global connectivity.Nevertheless, there is a disparity in the spread of IT across the world between the developed and the developing nations. The paper describes the use of IT in Sri Lanka and how the nation strives to integrate the opportunities and challenges it provides. The paper provides the background of a new government concept called E-Sri Lanka, with the goal of creating a full IT environment projected to bridge the information gap within the nation. The country is making a laudable effort to create a complete IT environment, and the paper brings forth the developments made over the years in the spheres of information and Information Technology, through government decisions, IT education, applications and institutional activity.

This paper investigates the major factors of the information society measured by ICT-related expenditure per capita in GDP. Using the panel data on 50 countries during 1992-2001 periods, this article reviews what is known about the determinants of the ICT expenditure figures and takes it as a proxy measure for the informatization across countries. Models were estimated to explore determinants using a cross-country analysis. Consistent with previous literatures, the results show that per capita income and ICT-related infrastructures were two robust explanators. Moreover, human capital investment significantly contributes to the national informatization in developing world. Openness to foreign trade should also be an important determinant as if the statistical analysis performed in the paper did give any statistical support. Consequently, to be able to take actions to bridge the digital divide or to eradicate information poverty, overall results in the paper can be helpful for policy-makers to establish the promising policies concerning national informatization.",Journal of Asia-Pacific Studies,2007,14,1,125-142,이충기,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1000394007,1,

We begin with a fairly meticulous description from our ethnographic work to which we'll refer throughout the paper. Though we consider this particular instance, we note that it represents of a wide range of instances from our ethnographic work in homes and businesses over several years in Brazil, Costa Rica, Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, Korea and India. Our goal in this paper, however, is to change the conversation from discussions of infrastructure and capacity building to considerations of local, lived conditions in actual homes and actual businesses to suggest design alternatives that make effective use of ICTs more amenable to various locales. We offer two design directions especially for high tech corporations: Designing for Locus of Control and Designing for Local Participation. Along the way, we'll argue to re-frame of the current conception of ""digital divide"", putting the burden not on those with limited access, but on limited understanding within the high tech industry.",The Journal of Community Informatics,2005,1,1,,"Salvador, Tony; Sherry, John",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133389984,4,

Drawing on data from case studies, the paper explains that mobile phones may not just help create new jobs and new sources of revenue to the state but can also contribute to economic growth by widening markets, creating better information flow, lowering transaction costs, and becoming substitute for costly transportation that is lacking in rural Africa. On the social front, the paper contends that the mobile phone can help create unique personal identities and status symbols for some users. The technology also facilitates the democratic process as groups can use the enhanced communication tools for political and community action thereby reducing the reliance on conventional and often government controlled media. The paper discusses these and other ways by which mobile phones can influence conditions in Africa to induce changes that promote economic and social development.

pub.1048548239,10.1016/s0065-2458(04)64007-1,Disability and Technology: Building Barriers or Creating Opportunities?,"In this chapter, the authors explore the relationship of technology to disability, and how technology can be both a source of liberation and an agent of exclusion for disabled people. The impact of the ‘digital divide’ on people with specific access needs, is examined and discussed, while the physical, cognitive and environmental factors that can contribute to exclusion as a result of technology design and implementation are examined in some depth. Demographic, moral and economic reasons as to why all those involved in the development of technology should take accessibility seriously are presented, while drivers for inclusive design—legislative, technical and economic—are discussed. A review of accessible and inclusive design practice, and the kinds of support that are available from a wide variety of sources for inclusive design is presented—showing that there are ways to minimize exclusion and to promote access. Finally, in looking towards a world where the true potential of technology to enhance the lives of disabled people can be fully reached, an overview is provided of research and development in supporting inclusive design, along with those challenges that remain to be overcome.",Advances in Computers,2005,64,,283-346,"Gregor, Peter; Sloan, David; Newell, Alan F.",University of Dundee,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1048548239,30,"[]|[]|Constructing Accessible Web Sites|2002||||10.1007/978-1-4302-1116-7|pub.1001542224|73;[Arnott, John L.; Newell, Alan F.; Alm, Norman]|[ur.013055144375.85; ur.010243237677.29; ur.014670741732.76]|Communications of the ACM|1992|35|5|46-57|10.1145/129875.129878|pub.1011682705|63;[Alm, Norman; Astell, Arlene; Ellis, Maggie; Dye, Richard; Gowans, Gary; Campbell, Jim]|[ur.014670741732.76; ur.01205735530.81; ur.012236715115.31; ur.015675215005.41; ur.014424362401.06; ur.016017323401.07]|Neuropsychological Rehabilitation|2004|14|1-2|117-134|10.1080/09602010343000147|pub.1018917729|102;[Pieper, M.; Morasch, H.; Piéla, G.]|[ur.07452034627.40; ur.012662004463.82; ur.015052326063.14]|Universal Access and Assistive Technology|2002|||119-130|10.1007/978-1-4471-3719-1_12|pub.1020139062|4;[Urban, Mark]|[]|Constructing Accessible Web Sites|2002|||282-302|10.1007/978-1-4302-1116-7_12|pub.1021093503|2;[Arnott, John; Javed, Muhammad]|[ur.013055144375.85; ]|Augmentative and Alternative Communication|1992|8|3|215-223|10.1080/07434619212331276203|pub.1030968411|31;[Clarkson, John; Keates, Simeon; Coleman, Roger; Lebbon, Cherie]|[]|Inclusive Design, Design for the Whole Population|2003||||10.1007/978-1-4471-0001-0|pub.1033382667|158;[Sloan, David; Gregor, Peter; Rowan, Murray; Booth, Paul]|[; ur.016326000351.41; ; ]|Proceedings on the 2000 conference on Universal Usability  - CUU '00|2000|||96-101|10.1145/355460.355480|pub.1035854102|26;[Inglis, E.

This study extracts the development activities from public websites and e-services for citizens and businesses. The study is based on the literature review and major website investigation to explore e-services provided government organizations in Bangladesh. Though lack of proper infrastructure and digital divide are the known major causes behind the failures of e-service implementation, the study reveals that e-government applications have been growing in Bangladesh. The prospects include mobile phone based e-service development, and public private partnership (PPP), while the challenges are frequent power interruption, lack of techno-savvy people in public organizations to look after the systems, etc. The increased number of e-services shows the progress of the country. The paper also contributes to identifying the success factors of e-services as well as factors accountable for unsatisfactory results in deploying e-services in Bangladesh. It is expected that the study would help the planners and policy-makers of the country to address the challenges for future development of e-government applications in Bangladesh.",Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance - ICEGOV '10,2010,,,255-260,"Bhuiyan, M.

E-voting should first comply with the existing legal and regulatory framework. Moreover, e-voting should be technically implemented in such a way that ensures adequate user requirements. As a result, the aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to identify the set of generic constitutional requirements, which should be met when designing an e-voting system for general elections. This set will lead to the specific (design) principles of a legally acceptable e-voting system. Second, to identify, using the Rational Unified Process, the requirements of an adequately secure e-voting system. These requirements stem from the design principles identified previously. The paper concludes that an e-voting capability should, for the time being, be considered only as a complementary means to the traditional election processes. This is mainly due to the digital divide, to the inherent distrust in the e-voting procedure, as well as to the inadequacy of the existing technological means to meet certain requirements.",Computers & Security,2002,21,6,539-556,"Gritzalis, Dimitris A",Athens University of Economics and Business,Greece,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040996421,79,"[Mercuri, Rebecca]|[ur.016470074133.75]|Communications of the ACM|2000|43|11|176|10.1145/353360.353378|pub.1010501377|5;[Schoenmakers, Berry]|[ur.07426421641.21]|Proceedings of the tenth conference on Computers, freedom and privacy challenging the assumptions - CFP '00|2000|||231-233|10.1145/332186.332288|pub.1014558473|2;[Hoffman, Lance J.; Cranor, Lorrie]|[ur.01143473600.97; ur.012313770727.30]|Communications of the ACM|2001|44|1|69-71|10.1145/357489.357510|pub.1036708056|15;[Mitrou, Lilian; Gritzalis, Dimitris; Katsikas, Sokratis]|[ur.012704012433.34; ur.07351603334.20; ur.01063225555.26]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2002|86||469-480|10.1007/978-0-387-35586-3_37|pub.1038157299|39;[Cramer, Ronald; Franklin, Matthew; Schoenmakers, Berry; Yung, Moti]|[ur.013660213711.14; ur.011257662405.59; ur.012315410054.86; ur.016677435253.49]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|1996|1070||72-83|10.1007/3-540-68339-9_7|pub.1041805094|158;[Phillips, Deborah M.; von Spakovsky, Hans A.]|[; ]|Communications of the ACM|2001|44|1|73-ff.|10.1145/357489.357512|pub.1045705328|28;[Ikonomopoulos, Spyros; Lambrinoudakis, Costas; Gritzalis, Dimitris; Kokolakis, Spyros; Vassiliou, Kostas]|[ur.015334731013.19; ur.014155022302.27; ur.07351603334.20; ur.016152672323.18; ]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2002|86||507-519|10.1007/978-0-387-35586-3_40|pub.1049483702|14;[Schoenmakers, Berry]|[ur.07426421641.21]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|1999|1666||148-164|10.1007/3-540-48405-1_10|pub.1052579524|272;[Butler, R.; Welch, V.; Engert, D.; Foster, I.; Tuecke, S.; Volmer, J.; Kesselman, C.]|[ur.0635530224.37; ur.016532216777.55; ; ur.0634177304.42; ur.07350736171.00; ; ur.01022504670.00]|Computer|2000|33|12|60-66|10.1109/2.889094|pub.1061106331|186"

Perhaps not unexpectedly, participants in this commemorative event reflected on the rapid development of networking and what we today call the Internet and predicted its ubiquity in everyday life, likening it to electricity. Obviously, however, we are not quite there yet. Recent data from the U.S. Department of Commerce suggest that, despite rapidly increasing rates of computer ownership and Internet access in the United States, there are still many people who have been left out of the information revolution. Researchers found that Internet access is highly correlated with income, education level and race, leading them to conclude: The information ‘haves’ have dramatically outpaced the information ‘have nots’ in their access to electronic services. As a result, the gap between these groups — the digital divide — has grown over time.

A total of 61 subjects (51% female, mean age 19) participated in the research sessions. Participants completed the CEW fluency scale [Bunz, U. (2004). The computer-email-web (CEW) fluency scale – Development and validation. International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 17(4), 477–504.], the computer anxiety ratings scale [Heinssen, R. K., Glass, C. R., & Knight L. A. (1987). Assessing computer anxiety: Development and validation of the computer anxiety rating scale. Computers in Human Behavior, 3, 49–59.], and an applied protocol developed for this study. Results show that the less computer anxiety subjects reported, the higher they perceived their CEW fluency to be (p=.001), but there was no significant relationship between computer anxiety and actual fluency (p=.12). There was no gender difference as to actual CEW fluency (p=.11), but women perceived their fluency lower than did men (p=.012). Overall results validate the robustness of the CEW fluency scale, help identify CEW fluency as a digital divide component, and underscore the importance of initiatives to raise women’s technological self-confidence.",Computers in Human Behavior,2007,23,5,2321-2344,"Bunz, Ulla;

Among the antecedents considered are attitudes about the Internet and their ability to predict Internet use. Participants in the project were 117 adults who completed attitude measures at pre-trial, 3 months, 9 months and post-trial (16 months) and had their Internet use automatically recorded. Ethnographic accounts of their experiences with the Internet were also obtained. Findings indicate that attitudes about privacy and reliability of information on the Internet predict Internet use, but not as expected. Participants who believed less in privacy and reliability of information used the Internet more, even after the contributions of demographic characteristics (race and age), pre-trial experience using the Internet, and actual Internet use during the preceding time period were considered. Attitudes about the potential harm to children and health from Internet use predicted less use.

pub.1061394750,10.1109/mcom.2008.4463771,Interoperability between WiMAXand broadband mobile space networks [topics in radio communications],"In several countries manufacturers, operators, and public authorities look at WiMAX system as a viable technology to fill the ""digital divide,"" providing broadband services mainly in suburban and rural areas, but also in densely populated areas. Nevertheless, as a standalone system it will never offer global services, and to complement its capabilities, the utilization of broadband space-based access shared among users represents a scalable and cost-effective solution to offer wider area coverage, improved performance in terms of QoS, service continuity in case of terrestrial network failure, and long-range user mobility. Integration between WiMAX and a space-based infrastructure, composed of a combination of satellites and high altitude platforms, can be pursued in several ways. The simplest solution is based on connecting a WiMAX network by means of a terrestrial network terminating at a hub station connected to the space infrastructure. A more flexible solution should allow the WiMAX subscriber station or base station to directly access the space infrastructure. This article addresses the identification of suitable scenarios and a feasibility analysis presenting link budget results related to a subset of the identified solutions.",IEEE Communications Magazine,2008,46,3,50-57,"Giuliano, Romeo; Luglio, Michele; Mazzenga, Franco",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1061394750,23,"[Santella, Giovanni; Mazzenga, Franco]|[ur.014165572373.26; ur.015415470653.89]|European Transactions on Telecommunications|2001|12|2|115-125|10.1002/ett.4460120206|pub.1048407331|1;[Santella, G.; Mazzenga, F.]|[ur.014165572373.26; ur.015415470653.89]|IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology|1998|47|1|142-151|10.1109/25.661041|pub.1061134923|120;[Leo, Marco; Luglio, Michele]|[ur.011414372425.89; ur.07637305501.07]|IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology|2001|50|3|750|10.1109/25.933310|pub.1061135579|12;[Karapantazis, S.; Pavlidou, F.]|[ur.013152626141.31; ur.013660355347.19]|IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials|2005|7|1|2-31|10.1109/comst.2005.1423332|pub.1061258132|193"

For example, in Louisiana, in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, every faculty member at the university level has to have a Blackboard presence and a disaster plan so that classes can continue in the event of a catastrophe. Those faculty called upon to assist their peers in complying with the directives are often chosen only because they are more comfortable than others with technology. Often, trainees are uncomfortable in such training, and senior faculty, often later “digital immigrants,” can be resentful. The researchers and authors of this paper have garnered $443,658 in grants involving training faculty in instructional technology. Through their experiences, the authors and researchers have isolated seven key practices that make such training successful. This article describes those practices and supports the findings of the primary research with secondary research on andragogy and Marc Prensky’s ideas of the literacy divide that exists between “digital natives” and “digital immigrants.” By considering the basic tenets of adult education, we can be better facilitators of valuable training sessions that will bridge the digital divide.",Adult Learning in the Digital Age,2010,,,178-187,"Kidd, Terry T.; Keengwe, Jared; Rockett, Danika; Powell, Tamara; Vessel, Amy Massey; Kimbell-Lopez, Kimberly; Cummins, Carrice; Hill, Janis","University of Maryland, Baltimore County; Kennesaw State University; Louisiana Tech University",United States; United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052733905,0,"[Knowles, Malcolm S; Holton, Elwood F; Swanson, Richard A]|[ur.013710155634.47; ur.014227730127.93; ur.016532755170.11]||2005||||10.4324/9780080481913|pub.1012545316|948;[Prensky, Marc]|[ur.010351560201.91]|On the Horizon The International Journal of Learning Futures|2001|9|5|1-6|10.1108/10748120110424816|pub.1022939366|6303;[Cooper, Joel; Weaver, Kimberlee D.]|[; ur.0770707336.29]||2003||||10.4324/9781410608932|pub.1034254512|181;[Enoch, Yael; Soker, Zeev]|[ur.014261777341.70; ur.016452320741.31]|Open Learning The Journal of Open Distance and e-Learning|2006|21|2|99-110|10.1080/02680510600713045|pub.1038654253|61;[van Dijk, Jan; Hacker, Kenneth]|[; ]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|315-326|10.1080/01972240309487|pub.1047421245|709;[Sorcinelli, Mary Deane]|[ur.014446575343.30]|Innovative Higher Education|1999|24|1|61-72|10.1023/b:ihie.0000008146.68462.e5|pub.1052371255|9;[Warschauer, Mark]|[]|First Monday|2002|7|7||10.5210/fm.v7i7.967|pub.1072710766|277"

How does increased state regulation of municipal broadband networks affect this trend and how can cities respond? As cities use wireless broadband technology to enhance services to citizens, the growth of municipal wireless deployments has transitioned from linear to exponential. In response, many states have passed laws to regulate and restrict cities' ability to own, operate, deploy, or profit from either telecommunications or information services. Current and pending laws will be examined to understand how cities can deploy a wireless broadband network under these regulations. An analysis of municipal facilities and technology expertise illustrates the opportunity for public–private cooperation in wireless deployments. This paper will show that cooperation is beneficial in many cases. Finally, current business models will be examined for their ability to foster cooperation between the public and private sectors, bridge the digital divide, and create competition among private sector providers.",Government Information Quarterly,2006,23,3-4,359-380,"Tapia, Andrea; Maitland, Carleen; Stone, Matt",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049896583,42,"[Lee, Sang M.; Tan, Xin; Trimi, Silvana]|[ur.010605430361.02; ; ur.010664037513.94]|Communications of the ACM|2005|48|10|99-104|10.1145/1089107.1089112|pub.1003732488|224;[Prieger, James]|[ur.014605206564.75]|Telecommunications Policy|1998|22|1|57-71|10.1016/s0308-5961(97)00057-8|pub.1013500272|36;[Sawyer, Steve; Tapia, Andrea; Pesheck, Leonard; Davenport, John]|[ur.016707364277.62; ur.0607300050.25; ; ]|Communications of the ACM|2004|47|3|62-65|10.1145/971617.971647|pub.1024935890|32;[Strover, Sharon; Chapman, Gary; Waters, Jody]|[ur.012341524001.11; ; ]|Telecommunications Policy|2004|28|7-8|465-485|10.1016/j.telpol.2004.05.008|pub.1035876282|46;[Sawyer, Steve; Tapia, Andrea]|[ur.016707364277.62; ur.0607300050.25]|International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction|2005|1|3|1-14|10.4018/jthi.2005070101|pub.1041246944|81;[Gillett, Sharon E; Lehr, William H; Osorio, Carlos]|[ur.014205054675.54; ur.016001202377.84; ur.016511016102.36]|Telecommunications Policy|2004|28|7-8|537-558|10.1016/j.telpol.2004.05.001|pub.1046333877|101"
pub.1041986665,10.3917/risa.741.0103,L'utilisation des canaux de prestation de service par les citoyens aux Pays-Bas ; implications pour la gestion multicanaux,"Many governmental organizations are changing their service channel management strategies to multi-channel management. However, very few empirical studies exist that explore how these multi-channel strategies should be shaped. In this article we test a number of hypotheses on citizens’ channel use behaviour and the determinants of this behaviour. Further, we take into account the differences between citizens with and without a personal computer. In our conclusions we call for multi-channel strategies that do not only incorporate the features of service channels and the front—back office integration, but also deal with personal characteristics and task characteristics. Further, digital divide issues still influence channel usage by citizens, so it is necessary to keep all channels open for citizens. Finally, our study reveals that multi-channelling is a very complex subject on which research is still in its infancy.Points for practitionersMulti-channel management may benefit most from channel integration.Channels have different characteristics that render them suitable for different (parts of) services. sComputer `have-nots’ still rely on traditional service channels, so these should remain accessible.",International Review of Administrative Sciences,2008,Vol. 74,1,103-121,"Pieterson, Willem; Ebbers, Wolfgang",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041986665,1,"[Black, Nancy Jo; Lockett, Andy; Ennew, Christine; Winklhofer, Heidi; McKechnie, Sally]|[ur.012162455015.99; ur.013176776573.49; ur.014666300011.12; ur.014315744305.73; ur.012762744657.30]|International Journal of Bank Marketing|2002|20|4|161-173|10.1108/02652320210432945|pub.1012368358|178;[Lee, Jinkook]|[ur.01313210556.44]|Journal of Services Marketing|2002|16|3|238-258|10.1108/08876040210427227|pub.1014022306|77;[van Dijk, Jan A.G.M.]|[ur.016570250333.33]|Poetics|2006|34|4-5|221-235|10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004|pub.1014130665|741;[Balasubramanian, Sridhar; Raghunathan, Rajagopal; Mahajan, Vijay]|[ur.010020707767.06; ur.016370472561.41; ur.011344150523.25]|Journal of Interactive Marketing|2005|19|2|12-30|10.1002/dir.20032|pub.1029710015|298;[Reddick, Christopher G.]|[ur.07774604557.93]|Government Information Quarterly|2005|22|1|38-57|10.1016/j.giq.2004.10.003|pub.1035661478|328;[Chen, Yu-Che; Dimitrova, Daniela V.]|[ur.013172643641.64; ur.014237167607.22]|International Journal of Electronic Government Research|2006|2|1|54-76|10.4018/jegr.2006010104|pub.1041598746|34;[Noble, Stephanie M.; Griffith, David A.; Weinberger, Marc G.]|[ur.012777741005.39; ur.013441435413.38; ur.016452317065.54]|Journal of Business Research|2005|58|12|1643-1651|10.1016/j.jbusres.2004.10.005|pub.1049283549|161;[Kwast, Myron L.; Starr-McCluer, Martha; Wolken, John D.]|[ur.016353300707.55; ur.016161761231.87; ]|The Antitrust Bulletin|1997|42|4|973-995|10.1177/0003603x9704200405|pub.1049527988|125;[Dugdale, Anni; Daly, Anne; Papandrea, Franco; Maley, Maria]|[ur.014534771635.48; ur.012364130477.62; ur.016171516463.30; ur.07657064211.52]|International Review of Administrative Sciences|2005|71|1|109-118|10.1177/0020852305051687|pub.1053069635|79;[Thomas, J.

pub.1023680317,10.1016/j.elerap.2006.06.002,Procurement models in the agricultural supply chain: A case study of online coffee auctions in India,"During the past few years, several innovative IT-based applications have emerged around the world that promise to bridge the proverbial “digital divide” by linking growers directly to domestic and international markets through the Internet. Online commodity auctions are an example of such initiatives and have the potential to impact the livelihood of millions around the world. However, an important factor that affects the benefits obtained by growers is the supply chain structure that results from the introduction of the online platform. In this paper, we provide a case study of an online coffee auction established in India for selling various grades of coffee beans. The focus of the case study is on the supply chain structure that is likely to evolve under various product and supplier characteristics. We argue that the online direct selling of commodities by growers is likely to evolve only under a certain set of conditions. We also argue that governments and platform providers can facilitate online direct selling by growers through initiatives that increase the bargaining power of the growers and increase the confidence of the buyer to directly procure from lesser known growers.",Electronic Commerce Research and Applications,2007,6,3,309-321,"Banker, Rajiv D.; Mitra, Sabyasachi",Temple University; Georgia Institute of Technology,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023680317,16,"[Clemons, Eric K.; Reddi, Sashidhar P.; Row, Michael C.]|[ur.013116612231.02; ur.010733022076.29; ur.011231137142.83]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1993|10|2|9-35|10.1080/07421222.1993.11517998|pub.1000533320|606;[Quibria, M.G; Ahmed, Shamsun N; Tschang, Ted; Reyes-Macasaquit, Mari-Len]|[ur.015764721413.10; ur.010654611213.10; ur.012247552213.80; ur.015235454213.44]|Journal of Asian Economics|2003|13|6|811-825|10.1016/s1049-0078(02)00186-0|pub.1000815131|147;[Sarkar, Mitrabarun; Butler, Brian; Steinfield, Charles]|[ur.015372642227.26; ur.015731707377.93; ur.013651017147.33]|Journal of Business Research|1998|41|3|215-221|10.1016/s0148-2963(97)00064-7|pub.1004714039|98;[Mahadevan, B.]|[]|California Management Review|2003|46|1|86-100|10.2307/41166233|pub.1005626503|47;[Lee, Ho Geun; Westland, J.

Because it was parallel to the binding election, it acted as a simulation. The project group ‘Electronic Voting by Internet’ (ESI) was founded in June 2001 and was a public-private cooperation with the goal of managing the technical and organizational implementation of Internet voting and to evaluate, aside from the technical aspects, the legal and political framework. The members were the Faculty of Computer Science and the Institute for Political Science at the University of Marburg, the local administration of the city of Marburg, the local administration of the county of Marburg-Biedenkopf, the electoral supervisor (Landeswahlleiter) of the state of Hessen (Ministry of the Interior), the commissioner for data protection (Datenschutzbeauftragter) of the state of Hesse, the regional computing centre (KIV) and a local private software company.

With her many problems of hunger, epidemics, war, and other related socio-economic problems, the dzfusion of the Internet and related technologies might be the last thing to be associated with Africa. However, we are experiencing the contrary. Sub-Saharan countries are experiencing tremendous growth in Internet connectivity, the use of computers, and in the dzfusion of wireless communications. Although still at its starting stages, electronic commerce is one of the growth areas for information and communication technologies (ICTs) in Africa. This paper presents a research framework for assessing electronic commerce in Sub-Saharan Africa. It describes the nature of the digital divide, and explains the need for the commercial applications of the Internet in developing countries in general. Further, it presents literature on e-commerce frameworks, ICT dzfusion, and ICTs in developing countries that shed light on diferent aspects of e-commerce in Sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, it proposes a consolidating framework that synthesizes these various literature streams and lays groundwork for a focused body of research in this area.",Journal of Global Information Technology Management,2003,6,3,44-66,"Okoli, Chitu; Mbarika, Victor A.

As such efforts are being made to draw in segments of the population that are negatively affected by the digital divide. Not included in these efforts is a community of individuals, most of who have the lowest literacy rates and come from the lowest income strata in society—prison inmates. Despite a few scattered attempts, these individuals have virtually no access to resources and training that would create the condition by which when released they will be able to complete commonplace tasks that depend on an assortment of digital technologies. Discussions around access are often confronted with scepticism by prison administration and citizens alike. This paper uses the information obtained about National and Washington state specific prisons to describe the landscape and the importance of preparing incarcerated individuals to confront an information society. Finally, using the Access Rainbow, the paper brings forth obstacles related to introducing a level of access and training that will prepare inmates to be productive participants in a technological based socioeconomic system after release from prison.",The Journal of Community Informatics,2011,6,3,,"Magassa, Lassana",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140560468,0,

However, use of ICT may not be the same for women as it is for men. Technical, social and cultural barriers exacerbate women's exclusion from the benefits of ICT for development. This paper is based on a qualitative analysis of the benefits of ICT and the barriers facing women to fully realize those benefits, particularly through public access places such as libraries, telecenters and cybercafés. We describe individual benefits such as increased self‐esteem, reduced isolation, access to markets, empowerment and access to health information. We also describe collective benefits such as economic growth, improved health and education, capacity building and cultural transformation. Finally, we discuss barriers that are particularly significant to women such as location, infrastructure and connectivity; time and money; lack of relevant content; low education and literacy; and social norms and perceptions.

pub.1019820031,10.1016/j.intcom.2009.05.005,Technology for supporting web information search and learning in Sign Language,"Sign Languages (SL) are underrepresented in the digital world, which contributes to the digital divide for the Deaf Community. In this paper, our goal is twofold: (1) to review the implications of current SL generation technologies for two key user web tasks, information search and learning and (2) to propose a taxonomy of the technical and functional dimensions for categorizing those technologies. The review reveals that although contents can currently be portrayed in SL by means of videos of human signers or avatars, the debate about how bilingual (text and SL) versus SL-only websites affect signers’ comprehension of hypertext content emerges as an unresolved issue in need of further empirical research. The taxonomy highlights that videos of human signers are ecological but require a high-cost group of experts to perform text to SL translations, video editing and web uploading. Avatar technology, generally associated with automatic text-SL translators, reduces bandwidth requirements and human resources but it lacks reliability. The insights gained through this review may enable designers, educators or users to select the technology that best suits their goals.",Interacting with Computers,2009,21,4,243-256,"Fajardo, Inmaculada; Vigo, Markel; Salmerón, Ladislao",University of Valencia; University of the Basque Country,Spain; Spain,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019820031,19,"[Huenerfauth, Matt]|[ur.014723707021.37]|Universal Access in the Information Society|2007|6|4|419-434|10.1007/s10209-007-0095-7|pub.1000431610|17;[Yanagimoto, Manabu]|[]|ACM SIGGRAPH 2004 Web graphics on   - SIGGRAPH '04|2004|||20|10.1145/1186194.1186222|pub.1001982472|1;[Moreno, Roxana; Mayer, Richard E.]|[ur.0705040040.65; ur.01166150473.77]|Journal of Educational Psychology|2002|94|1|156-163|10.1037/0022-0663.94.1.156|pub.1003405487|243;[Brumby, Duncan P.; Howes, Andrew]|[ur.010754674215.33; ur.0663216434.02]|Human-Computer Interaction|2008|23|1|1-46|10.1080/07370020701851078|pub.1005046733|36;[Adamo-Villani, Nicoletta; Beni, Gerardo]|[ur.015022456563.48; ur.01036653725.11]|ACM SIGGRAPH 2005 Educators program on   - SIGGRAPH '05|2005|||38|10.1145/1187358.1187404|pub.1005508177|1;[Kintsch, Walter]|[ur.051723162.03]|Psychological Review|1988|95|2|163-182|10.1037/0033-295x.95.2.163|pub.1006524629|2818;[Pirolli, Peter; Fu, Wai-Tat]|[ur.07447117007.63; ur.016430250553.00]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2003|2702||45-54|10.1007/3-540-44963-9_8|pub.1010670514|92;[Pirolli, Peter; Card, Stuart]|[ur.07447117007.63; ur.012405240247.04]|Psychological Review|1999|106|4|643-675|10.1037/0033-295x.106.4.643|pub.1011152620|1146;[Huenerfauth, Matt]|[ur.014723707021.37]|ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing|2009|2|2|9|10.1145/1530064.1530067|pub.1013081619|30;[Fajardo, I.; Cañas, J.

pub.1014911606,10.1007/s10796-010-9267-8,A study of mobile internet user’s service quality perceptions from a user’s utilitarian and hedonic value tendency perspectives,"Although a few studies have focused on mobile value from the distinctive feature of a mobile technology perspective, limited attempts have been made from a mobile user’s value tendency perspective. In this study, building upon prior research on productivity-oriented and pleasure-oriented nature of systems, we categorize mobile values as having utilitarian and hedonic use. Based on these two values, we conceptualize types of tendency of mobile users’ application use namely utilitarian tendency and hedonic tendency. The goal of this study is to examine the relationships between mobile consumers’ value tendency and their perceptions of mobile Internet service quality in terms of three different mobile quality dimensions (i.e., connection quality, design quality, and information quality). In addition, drawing upon the “digital divide” literature, the relationships between mobile users’ personal dispositions (i.e., maturity and socio-economic status) and their mobile value tendency are also tested. The empirical results of the study, the interpretation of the results, research contributions, and limitations are discussed.",Information Systems Frontiers,2010,14,2,409-421,"Kim, Dan J.; Hwang, Yujong",University of Houston - Clear Lake; DePaul University; Kyung Hee University,United States; United States; South Korea,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014911606,87,"[Bentler, P M]|[ur.01273314037.58]|Psychological Bulletin|1990|107|2|238-246|10.1037/0033-2909.107.2.238|pub.1000641993|16795;[King, William R.; Epstein, Barry J.]|[ur.014431076223.06; ur.012233770015.10]|Decision Sciences|1983|14|1|34-45|10.1111/j.1540-5915.1983.tb00167.x|pub.1001724642|81;[Dyke, Thomas P.; Prybutok, Victor R.; Kappelman, Leon A.]|[; ur.015307217435.54; ur.015165334263.95]|Decision Sciences|1999|30|3|877-891|10.1111/j.1540-5915.1999.tb00911.x|pub.1002000734|116;[Hong, SeJoon; Thong, James Y.L.; Tam, Kar Yan]|[; ur.010227735415.39; ur.012117113412.83]|Decision Support Systems|2006|42|3|1819-1834|10.1016/j.dss.2006.03.009|pub.1002299042|539;[Podsakoff, Philip M.; MacKenzie, Scott B.; Lee, Jeong-Yeon; Podsakoff, Nathan P.]|[ur.011421032067.61; ur.012023756165.66; ur.01253563456.83; ur.014406734067.77]|Journal of Applied Psychology|2003|88|5|879-903|10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879|pub.1003271831|39655;[Young, Lawrence F.]|[]|Information Systems Management|1984|1|3|93-96|10.1080/07399019408963054|pub.1004663340|1;[Chen, Wenhong; Boase, Jeffrey; Wellman, Barry]|[ur.010334265342.93; ur.01023052656.15; ur.011001756750.07]|The Internet in Everyday Life|2002|||74-113|10.1002/9780470774298.ch2|pub.1004780025|72;[Cheong, Je Ho; Park, Myeong‐Cheol]|[; ur.010100653413.58]|Internet Research|2005|15|2|125-140|10.1108/10662240510590324|pub.1004819758|317;[Heinonen, Kristina; Strandvik, Tore]|[ur.015315160314.08; ur.013653316743.18]|Journal of Service Management|2005|16|2|186-198|10.1108/09564230510592306|pub.1007429902|31;[Collier, Joel E.; Bienstock, Carol C.]|[ur.013421663671.29; ur.014733537731.68]|Journal of Service Research|2006|8|3|260-275|10.1177/1094670505278867|pub.1009298074|595;[Holsapple, Clyde W.; Wu, Jiming]|[ur.013024027235.20; ur.015444706133.40]|ACM SIGMIS Database the DATABASE for Advances in Information Systems|2007|38|4|86-89|10.1145/1314234.1314250|pub.1012391688|66;[Wood, Stephanie; Chatterjee, Samir]|[; ur.014047547134.66]|Information Systems Frontiers|2002|4|1|63-84|10.1023/a:1015390607862|pub.1013473346|6;[Dyer, Jeffrey H.]|[ur.0774001656.46]|Strategic Management Journal|1997|18|7|535-556|10.1002/(sici)1097-0266(199708)18:7<535::aid-smj885>3.0.co;2-z|pub.1013826722|1101;[Rao, H.

IT also connects the machine environment with human applications, and has emerged as a force for global connectivity. Nevertheless, there is a disparity in the spread of IT across the world between the developed and the developing nations. The paper describes the use of IT in Sri Lanka and how the nation strives to integrate the opportunities and challenges it provides. The paper provides the background of a new government concept called E-Sri Lanka, with the goal of creating a full IT environment projected to bridge the information gap within the nation. The country is making a laudable effort to create a complete IT environment, and the paper brings forth the developments made over the years in the spheres of information and Information Technology, through government decisions, IT education, applications and institutional activity. The article concludes on a note of optimism—there is interactivity between IT and workers rather than humans being replaced by machines.",The International Information & Library Review,2004,36,4,319-327,"Weerasinghe, Shivanthi",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014502714,2,"[Quibria, M.G; Ahmed, Shamsun N; Tschang, Ted; Reyes-Macasaquit, Mari-Len]|[ur.015764721413.10; ur.010654611213.10; ur.012247552213.80; ur.015235454213.44]|Journal of Asian Economics|2003|13|6|811-825|10.1016/s1049-0078(02)00186-0|pub.1000815131|147"

This study aims to provide a better understanding to citizens’ adoption of e-government services through conceptualizing the role of intermediary organisations within e-government. In particular, this paper examines the importance of intermediaries in the adoption of e-government from a citizens’ perspective and the potential influence they have on bridging digital divide in societies. Following previous studies on e-government adoption, the study employs the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to examine the influence of intermediaries on citizens’ adoption of e-government services in the context of Madinah city in Saudi Arabia. The results in this study indicates that the citizens’ efforts towards using e-government services, their trust of the Internet and their trust of intermediary organisations contribute significantly towards their e-government adoption behaviour. Further, the facilitating conditions the intermediary organisations offer have a significant impact on the usage of e-government services.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2011,6846,,62-74,"Al-Sobhi, Faris; Weerakkody, Vishanth; El-Haddadeh, Ramzi",Brunel University London,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010263207,27,"[Howells, Jeremy]|[ur.016651532665.58]|Research Policy|2006|35|5|715-728|10.1016/j.respol.2006.03.005|pub.1013951564|1153;[Carter, Lemuria; Bélanger, France]|[ur.010501313522.42; ur.07347634165.87]|Information Systems Journal|2005|15|1|5-25|10.1111/j.1365-2575.2005.00183.x|pub.1020923035|1145;[Janssen, Marijn; Klievink, Bram]|[ur.014364434563.45; ur.010243137125.07]|International Journal of Electronic Government Research|2009|5|3|36-46|10.4018/jegr.2009070103|pub.1022855507|34;[Dwivedi, Y.K.; Khoumbati, K.; Williams; Lal, B.]|[ur.013351366321.15; ur.01265700427.26; ur.011356650655.30; ur.014071307631.57]|Transforming Government People Process and Policy|2007|1|3|285-297|10.1108/17506160710778112|pub.1027755553|26;[Ajzen, Icek]|[ur.011652717561.39]|Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|1991|50|2|179-211|10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-t|pub.1028082114|43112;[Bailey, Joseph P.; Bakos, Yannis]|[; ur.011426007706.48]|International Journal of Electronic Commerce|1997|1|3|7-20|10.1080/10864415.1997.11518287|pub.1037797725|374;[Al‐Sobhi, Faris; Weerakkody, Vishanth; Kamal, Muhammad Mustafa]|[ur.016054624707.59; ur.07462137703.88; ur.010312516335.64]|Transforming Government People Process and Policy|2010|4|1|14-36|10.1108/17506161011028786|pub.1051813703|41;[HEEKS, RICHARD]|[ur.01241047651.15]|Journal of Public Policy|2005|25|1|51-74|10.1017/s0143814x05000206|pub.1054083470|137;[Pinto, J.K.; Mantel, S.J.]|[ur.011214301611.41; ]|IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management|1990|37|4|269-276|10.1109/17.62322|pub.1061098269|334;[Moore, Gary C.; Benbasat, Izak]|[; ur.0745713632.15]|Information Systems Research|1991|2|3|192-222|10.1287/isre.2.3.192|pub.1064711710|4532;[Davis, Fred D.; Bagozzi, Richard P.; Warshaw, Paul R.]|[ur.014060724401.60; ur.0712073700.63; ur.015250026703.09]|Management Science|1989|35|8|982-1003|10.1287/mnsc.35.8.982|pub.1064720609|12149;[Dwivedi, Yogesh Kumar; Weerakkody, Vishanth]|[ur.013351366321.15; ur.07462137703.88]|Electronic Government an International Journal|2007|4|1|43|10.1504/eg.2007.012178|pub.1067427528|39;[Hill, Richard J.; Fishbein, Martin; Ajzen, Icek]|[; ur.010374023362.96; ur.011652717561.39]|Contemporary Sociology A Journal of Reviews|1977|6|2|244|10.2307/2065853|pub.1069728876|1189;[AlAwadhi, S.; Morris, A.]|[; ]|2016 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)|2008|||219-219|10.1109/hicss.2008.452|pub.1094089246|247;[Succi, M.J.; Walter, Z.D.]|[ur.01231277656.99; ]|Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences. 1999.

We are approaching the final hour of our conference and I have the pleasure to introduce to you our panel this afternoon. I start with Anriette Esterhuysen. She came from South Africa to this conference, and she is the executive director of the Association for Progressive Communications, APC. This is an international network of more than 40 civil society organisations dedicated to empowering the supporting groups, especially with respect to the strategic use of information and communication technologies. Before, she was an executive director of Asengonet, an internet service provider, a training institution especially dedicated to the development sector in South Africa. She is also a founder of Womensnet in South Africa and has served on the African Technical Advisory Committee of the UN‘s Economic Commission for African information society initiative. She was also a member of the United Nation‘s ICT task force.

pub.1091789129,10.1002/9781405186407.wbiecp026,Personal Publishing,"Personal publishing by an individual or small group – generally not for profit and generally not aimed at a mass audience or utilizing mainstream publishers – has occurred for centuries. In its early years it took the form of, e.g., small‐scale pamphleteering, the circulation of diaries within faith‐based or friendship communities, or the publication of books of family history or autobiography using the “vanity” press (publishers whose income comes primarily from authors). Because of the economics of publishing, however, these practices tended to be marginal. With the advent of the personal computer and inexpensive desktop publishing tools, small‐scale personal publication became easier and a variety of small‐scale magazines sprang up (→ Zines). It has been the diffusion of access to the Internet in recent years across much of the world (→ Digital Divide), however, that has enabled a flourishing of online personal publishing and inspired a greater academic focus on this area. This started with personal Internet home pages in the mid‐1990s and has continued in the form of the “weblog” (a site consisting of items published in reverse chronological order) and, most recently, of profiles on social networking services like MySpace and Facebook.",The International Encyclopedia of Communication,2008,,,,"Brake, David",London School of Economics and Political Science,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091789129,0,"[Nardi, Bonnie A.; Schiano, Diane J.; Gumbrecht, Michelle]|[ur.012361270012.98; ur.0763730313.63; ur.016365321537.70]|Proceedings of the 2004 ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work  - CSCW '04|2004|||222-231|10.1145/1031607.1031643|pub.1001324878|275;[Sprengnether, Madelon; Culley, Margo; Iles, Teresa; Stanley, Liz]|[ur.012102063341.08; ; ; ]|The Women's Review of Books|1993|10|5|13|10.2307/4021452|pub.1102994813|34"

Following an interdisciplinary approach, the research reported in this article analyzes the wide variety of information that people seek on the Internet and investigates trends in Internet information activities between 2000 and 2004, using repeated cross-sectional data from the Pew Internet and American Life surveys to examine Internet activities that contribute to everyday life and their predictors. The objective is to deepen our understanding of Internet activities and everyday life and contribute to a growing body of research that utilizes large-scale empirical data on Internet use and everyday life. We ask: who is embedding the Internet into their everyday lives and what are the activities they pursue to facilitate everyday life? Findings demonstrate the differential returns for Internet use, particularly in key demographic categories. The study also contributes to emerging research on the digital divide, namely emphasis on the study of use rather than access to technology. Identifying trends in key Internet use dimensions enables policymakers to target populations who underutilize the potential of networked technologies.",Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,2008,59,11,1743-1760,"Buente, Wayne; Robbin, Alice",Indiana University Bloomington,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1012503051,69,"[Dhavan V.

We draw on a research project of South African higher education students' access to and use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to show that age is not a determining factor in students' digital lives; rather, their familiarity and experience using ICTs is more relevant. We also demonstrate that the notion of a generation of ‘digital natives’ is inaccurate: those with such attributes are effectively a digital elite. Instead of a new net generation growing up to replace an older analogue generation, there is a deepening digital divide in South Africa characterized not by age but by access and opportunity; indeed, digital apartheid is alive and well. We suggest that the possibility for digital democracy does exist in the form of a mobile society which is not age specific, and which is ubiquitous. Finally, we propose redefining the concepts ‘digital’, ‘net’, ‘native’, and ‘generation’ in favour of reclaiming the term ‘digitizen’.",Journal of Computer Assisted Learning,2010,26,5,357-369,"Brown, C.; Czerniewicz, L.",University of Cape Town,South Africa,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1006426156,156,"[Bennett, Sue; Maton, Karl; Kervin, Lisa]|[ur.016226000167.84; ur.013434101224.60; ur.016005563305.54]|British Journal of Educational Technology|2008|39|5|775-786|10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00793.x|pub.1002803578|1418;[LIEBERMAN, EVAN S.]|[ur.010374412033.91]|American Political Science Review|2005|99|3|435-452|10.1017/s0003055405051762|pub.1008856867|554;[Prensky, Marc]|[ur.010351560201.91]|On the Horizon The International Journal of Learning Futures|2001|9|6|1-6|10.1108/10748120110424843|pub.1022272567|982;[Prensky, Marc]|[ur.010351560201.91]|On the Horizon The International Journal of Learning Futures|2001|9|5|1-6|10.1108/10748120110424816|pub.1022939366|6303;[Czerniewicz, Laura; Williams, Kevin; Brown, Cheryl]|[ur.016276215773.10; ; ]|Research in Learning Technology|2009|17|2|75-88|10.1080/09687760903033058|pub.1058353630|56;[Broekman, I; Enslin, P; Pendlebury, S]|[; ur.014612373677.17; ur.010515665311.46]|South African Journal of Higher Education|2002|16|1||10.4314/sajhe.v16i1.25269|pub.1072496953|14;[Brown, CL; Czerniewicz, L]|[; ur.016276215773.10]|South African Journal of Higher Education|2008|21|6||10.4314/sajhe.v21i6.25272|pub.1072497424|4;[Chigona, Wallace; Chigona, Agnes; Ngqokelela, Bomkazi; Mpofu, Sicelo]|[ur.012353101513.05; ur.013370316511.96; ; ]|Journal of Information Information Technology and Organizations (Years 1-3)|2009|4||001-016|10.28945/123|pub.1092398237|20"
pub.1099623705,10.1002/j.1681-4835.2011.tb00329.x,Understanding IT Business Value Creation and Evaluation in Least Developed Economies,Information Technology (IT) is an important resource that can facilitate growth and development in both the developed and developing economies. The forces of globalisation increase the digital divide between the developed and developing economies is increasing. The least developed economies (LDEs) are the most vulnerable within this environment. Intense competition for IT resources means that LDEs need a deeper understanding of how to source and evaluate their IT‐related efforts. This effort puts LDEs in a better position to source funding from various stakeholders and promote localized investment in IT. This study presents a complementary approach to securing better IT‐related business value in organizations in the LDEs. It further evaluates how IT and the complementaries need to managed within the LDEs. Analysis of data collected from five LDEs show that organizations that invest in IT and related complementaries are able to better their business processes. The data also suggest that improved business processes lead to overall business processes improvements. The above is only possible if organizations adopt IT and make related changes in the complementary resources within the established culture and localizing the required changes.,The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2011,47,1,1-18,"Prasad, Acklesh",University of the South Pacific,Fiji,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099623705,2,"[Jeffers, Patrick I.; Muhanna, Waleed A.; Nault, Barrie R.]|[ur.012740672641.69; ur.013523512115.24; ur.01107433702.71]|Decision Sciences|2008|39|4|703-735|10.1111/j.1540-5915.2008.00209.x|pub.1000226060|105;[Wignaraja, Ganeshan]|[ur.016327055143.39]|Journal of Asian Economics|2008|19|1|29-39|10.1016/j.asieco.2007.12.001|pub.1002747498|35;[Dehning, Bruce; Richardson, Vernon J.]|[ur.010703015130.51; ur.011600322255.44]|Journal of Information Systems|2002|16|1|7-30|10.2308/jis.2002.16.1.7|pub.1007210377|244;[Raskin, Jef]|[]|Communications of the ACM|1997|40|2|98-101|10.1145/253671.253737|pub.1008407138|13;[Adam, Mariyam Suzy; Urquhart, Cathy]|[ur.010052312517.59; ur.013205766367.46]|Information and Organization|2009|19|1|1-21|10.1016/j.infoandorg.2007.11.002|pub.1009789950|25;[Davamanirajan, Prabu; Kauffman, Robert J.; Kriebel, Charles H.; Mukhopadhyay, Tridas]|[ur.016000363457.18; ur.015720352041.76; ur.011727046701.68; ur.01263333020.18]|Journal of Management Information Systems|2006|23|2|65-90|10.2753/mis0742-1222230204|pub.1013091019|55;[POWELL, THOMAS C.; DENT‐MICALLEF, ANNE]|[ur.016322317377.98; ur.07363171145.12]|Strategic Management Journal|1997|18|5|375-405|10.1002/(sici)1097-0266(199705)18:5<375::aid-smj876>3.0.co;2-7|pub.1013601792|1153;[Milgrom, Paul; Roberts, John]|[ur.01276737470.97; ur.013604632361.38]|Journal of Accounting and Economics|1995|19|2-3|179-208|10.1016/0165-4101(94)00382-f|pub.1014326307|1599;[Dehning, Bruce; Richardson, Vernon J.; Zmud, Robert W.]|[ur.010703015130.51; ur.011600322255.44; ur.012560475447.42]|Journal of Operations Management|2006|25|4|806-824|10.1016/j.jom.2006.09.001|pub.1015881434|248;[Chau, Patrick Y K; Kuan, Kevin K Y; Liang, Ting-Peng]|[ur.016133275022.18; ur.015540103707.99; ur.012200031617.83]|European Journal of Information Systems|2007|16|3|196-201|10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000666|pub.1018178459|27;[Mahmood, Mo Adam; Mann, Gary J.; Zwass, Vladimir]|[ur.012726100301.75; ur.013610577167.21; ]|Journal of Management Information Systems|2000|16|4|3-10|10.1080/07421222.2000.11518263|pub.1019343021|46;[Bakos, J.

These countries are experiencing tremendous growth in use of computers, Internet connectivity, wireless communications and many other related technologies. However, the same is not true for Africa's Least Developed Countries (LDCs) that are still greatly behind other regions of the world in terms of the level of basic telecommunications infrastructure such as teledensity (number of main telephone lines for every one hundred inhabitants). While it is true that Africa's LDCs have some Internet presence, it seems to be limited only to the urban elite. These countries may therefore not be in the position to exploit most of the benefits the Internet can offer. This study suggests a sound teledensity infrastructure as the precursor to the diffusion of various information and communications technologies. Furthermore this study proposes a set of strategies that Africa's LDCs should consider as steps to improve growth of their teledensity.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2002,9,1,1-13,"Mbarika, Victor W.

There are large disparities in this, particularly in underdeveloped rural areas of the world. Information and communication technologies designed to address this disparity must take into account the many barriers in the use of technology that these communities face. We define an ’inclusive technology’ as a technology which overcomes the barriers to using technology inherent within a given community and increases the opportunities available to that community. We propose a conceptual model and a set of heuristic measurements for examining the ’inclusiveness’ of a technology with respect to a given community, and illustrate their use by applying them to two real-world projects. By proposing this model and set of measurements, we hope to achieve a better understanding of’development projects’ and create a systematic process and a framework to assist software engineers in designing and evaluating software based services intended to reduce the Digital Divide.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2007,241,,35-48,"Pitula, K.; Radhakrishnan, T.",Concordia University,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1053002316,3,"[Pitula, K.; Radhakrishnan, T.]|[ur.0667446636.89; ur.01214321552.72]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2007|4554||243-252|10.1007/978-3-540-73279-2_28|pub.1029010882|6;[Ramı́rez, Ricardo]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|2001|25|5|315-330|10.1016/s0308-5961(01)00007-6|pub.1033162644|39;[Brewer, E.; Demmer, M.; Du, B.; Ho, M.; Kam, M.; Nedevschi, S.; Pal, J.; Patra, R.; Surana, S.; Fall, K.]|[ur.0621176610.34; ur.013463377151.21; ur.015672411073.59; ur.011204166163.74; ur.015057310430.44; ur.013327336644.60; ur.010432051166.17; ur.016336613335.90; ur.011033044415.27; ur.07617573671.17]|Computer|2005|38|6|25-38|10.1109/mc.2005.204|pub.1061387336|222;[Cecchini, Simone; Raina, Monica]|[ur.010657704011.01; ur.014626303323.23]|Information Technologies and International Development|2004|2|2|65-75|10.1162/1544752044193434|pub.1063350545|69;[Venkatesh; Morris; Davis; Davis]|[ur.012207572032.74; ur.013005152432.16; ; ]|MIS Quarterly|2003|27|3|425|10.2307/30036540|pub.1102515221|16354;[]|[]|Technology and Social Inclusion|2004||||10.7551/mitpress/6699.001.0001|pub.1110624278|439"

Digital TV services include data broadcasting services. Especially, in this paper, the authors propose a framework for developing interactive applications of data broadcast contents integrated with web services on a digital TV. The digital TV has become one of the terminal devices based on the recent ICT (Information Communication Technologies) supporting various intellectual human activities because data broadcast contents are very similar to web contents and can provide any information with multimedia data on a TV screen. The use of a digital TV is also significant to solve the digital divide problem because elder people are used to TV rather than PC. However, there are few data broadcast contents although there are a lot of various types of applications on the Web. Therefore, the integration of data broadcast contents with web services is effective way to enhance application fields of data broadcasting services. In this paper, the authors propose the application framework for that and also show several interactive applications to clarify its usefulness.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2011,6884,,63-72,"Okada, Yoshihiro; Takano, Shigeru",Kyushu University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1017426544,1,"[Morimoto, Hidekazu; Meing, Fanfan; Takano, Shigeru; Okada, Yoshihiro]|[; ; ur.015444625511.94; ur.012664300541.03]|2009 Sixth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualization|2009|||138-143|10.1109/cgiv.2009.88|pub.1095280399|3;[Okada, Y.; Tanaka, Y.]|[; ]|Proceedings Computer Animation'95|1995|||114-125|10.1109/ca.1995.393540|pub.1095467055|75"

Many people consider that the Internet is not only access to unlimited information, but also has a potential to make a difference in the development of human rights and democracy. Information and communications technologies, free software, and open source have a big role to play in this context. The importance of access is an issue: one tends to focus mainly on the physical access, which is only a small part in this connection. There are other types of limitations to access: the technology should be appropriate, be affordable, and a political will to provide all citizens with equal possibilities should support the introduction of the technologies. Who has access to these new technologies? Who does not have such access?

The case of the South African manufacturing sector,"Business-to-business electronic commerce has become a priority area for many international development organisations, particularly since concerns about the ‘digital divide’ have put the policymaking spotlight on the connection between ICTs and industrial development policies. This paper aims to explore the current state and likely future direction of B2B e-commerce in the South African manufacturing sector. The empirical research is based on 120 firm-level interviews, and 31 personal interviews with industry experts. The results suggest that B2B e-commerce is in an embryonic stage in the South African manufacturing sector, and technology and market dynamics are still casting its basic shape. The ability to realise efficiency gains in the B2B electronic marketplace will largely hinge on the climate of confidence and trust that businesses are able to create in their relations with their suppliers and customers. We argue that policy decisions will have a major impact on the kind of environment in which e-commerce will develop and should therefore be crafted with due recognition of its fragile and evolving nature.",Information Technology for Development,2003,10,1,25-40,"Moodley, Sagren",University of KwaZulu-Natal,South Africa,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002632355,13,"[Pavitt, Keith; Patel, Parimal]|[ur.012251713367.77; ur.011773150577.81]|Innovation Policy in a Global Economy|1999|||94-119|10.1017/cbo9780511599088.008|pub.1008284940|85;[Archibugi, Daniele; Michie, Jonathan]|[ur.013603163272.52; ur.01250107260.63]|Futures|1997|29|2|121-137|10.1016/s0016-3287(96)00072-9|pub.1024781025|84;[Georghiou, Luke]|[]|Prometheus|1993|11|2|291-291|10.1080/08109029308629360|pub.1034720489|255;[Hirst, Paul; Thompson, Grahame]|[; ]|Contemporary Capitalism|1997|||337-360|10.1017/cbo9781139174701.014|pub.1040403388|179;[Porter, Michael]|[]|Competitive Intelligence Review|1990|1|1|14-14|10.1002/cir.3880010112|pub.1041899459|3899;[Talero, Eduardo; Gaudette, Philip]|[; ]|Information Technology for Development|1995|6|3-4|145-188|10.1080/02681102.1995.9525267|pub.1042556486|44;[Habib, Adam; Padayachee, Vishnu]|[; ur.010227340271.10]|World Development|2000|28|2|245-263|10.1016/s0305-750x(99)00130-8|pub.1047361662|117;[Panagariya, Arvind]|[ur.016640120101.95]|World Economy|2000|23|8|959-978|10.1111/1467-9701.00313|pub.1049332587|56;[Uranga, Mikel Gomez]|[ur.012546427633.42]|Journal of Economic Issues|1999|33|3|773-776|10.1080/00213624.1999.11506206|pub.1051197971|35;[Graham, A.]|[]|Oxford Review of Economic Policy|2001|17|2|145-158|10.1093/oxrep/17.2.145|pub.1059967046|29;[Mansell, R.]|[ur.013665171232.89]|Oxford Review of Economic Policy|2001|17|2|282-295|10.1093/oxrep/17.2.282|pub.1059967054|74;[Lucking-Reiley, David; Spulber, Daniel F]|[ur.013065052425.93; ur.013562453163.17]|Journal of Economic Perspectives|2001|15|1|55-68|10.1257/jep.15.1.55|pub.1064530114|198;[]|[]|Choice|1989|26|09|26-5168-26-5168|10.5860/choice.26-5168|pub.1073290968|321;[]|[]|Choice|1990|28|02|28-1058-28-1058|10.5860/choice.28-1058|pub.1073300073|1974;[]|[]|Choice|1993|30|10|30-5686-30-5686|10.5860/choice.30-5686|pub.1073317960|15;[]|[]|Cambridge Journal of Economics|1995||||10.1093/oxfordjournals.cje.a035309|pub.1083475772|1332;[Kitson, Michael; Michie, Jonathan]|[; ]|Innovation Policy in a Global Economy|1999|||163-183|10.1017/cbo9780511599088.011|pub.1089393976|6;[Rosenberg, Nathan]|[]||1976||||10.1017/cbo9780511561313|pub.1098679455|1215;[Rosenberg, Nathan]|[]||1994||||10.1017/cbo9780511582554|pub.1098705309|712;[Pohjola, Matti]|[]||2001||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199243983.001.0001|pub.1098832966|254;[Archibugi, Daniele; Howells, Jeremy; Michie, Jonathan]|[]|Innovation Policy in a Global Economy|1999||||10.1017/cbo9780511599088|pub.1109374493|64;[Hanna, Nagy; Guy, Ken; Arnold, Erik]|[; ; ]|World Bank Discussion Papers|1995||||10.1596/0-8213-3216-3|pub.1109730878|36"

Some of them are targeting business, others aim to connect residents, and there are projects which fully include both in their strategy. In this paper we present three successful Dutch cases of municipal broadband access networks that target residents and SOHOs: Kenniswijk, OnsNet Nuenen and Wireless Leiden. For each case, we have taken a thorough look at the following aspects: background, business model, broadband network, e-services, consumers & promotion, problems, success factors and (intermediate) outcomes. Here we describe the main findings of this analysis.

It proposes a simple model of its growth and identifies the theoretical growth limits in each country. Some aspects of the European i2010 project implementation are presented, discussed, and compared with the model. Comments on bottlenecks and major barriers in the broadband Internet diffusion process are also offered. The existing digital gaps are irreducible in some cases and will exist as long as the current development conditions continue. The approach and analysis method proposed here may be useful in examining limits of other services or in other regions during the planning, design, implementation, and performance tracking stages of existing or new services.",IEEE Communications Magazine,2010,48,4,52-57,"Struzak, Ryszard",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1061395191,9,"[Keeling, M.

The potentials that can be derived from ICT in the development of Muslim world are discussed. The paper also outlined the challenges that deter the Muslim world from information-empowerment. Factors that hinder the Muslim world to migrate from digital gap to digital inclusion are discussed. Furthermore, the paper concludes that the developments of ICT and digital technologies if properly applied by Muslim world can lead them to be part of the information society and consequently become information power societies.

By means of using pictograms as the communication language and by tailoring down the interface to suit pictogram-based communication requirements, the service allows users to exchange real-time messages across the Internet to communicate with their relatives and acquaintances. Through our initial evaluation procedure with a group of eleven users with different types and degrees of cognitive impairments we show that a pictogram-based instant messaging service has a great potential to improve their communicative capabilities, as well as to enable their personal and social development.",Proceedings of the 6th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction Extending Boundaries - NordiCHI '10,2010,,,797-800,"Tuset, Pere; Barberán, Pere; Janer, Léonard; Buscà, Esteve; Delgado, Sandra; Vilà, Nuria",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1031055080,8,"[Tee, Kimberly; Moffatt, Karyn; Findlater, Leah; MacGregor, Eve; McGrenere, Joanna; Purves, Barbara; Fels, Sidney S.]|[; ur.01123771166.81; ur.013232323353.38; ur.012172367725.47; ur.016253031707.88; ur.01177117302.26; ur.01053157045.07]|Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|2005|||501-510|10.1145/1054972.1055042|pub.1008344435|30;[Munemori, Jun; Fukuda, Taro; Mohd Yatid, Moonyati Binti; Itou, Junko]|[ur.012416635625.88; ur.011716130626.09; ; ur.013140271307.02]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2008|5179||167-174|10.1007/978-3-540-85567-5_22|pub.1025904767|8;[Dawe, Melissa]|[ur.010377523073.22]|Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|2006|||1143-1152|10.1145/1124772.1124943|pub.1040014482|167;[Saint-Andre, P.]|[]|IEEE Internet Computing|2005|9|5|82-89|10.1109/mic.2005.110|pub.1061403514|46;[Jennings, R.B.; Nahum, E.M.; Olshefski, D.P.; Saha, D.; Shae, Zon-Yin; Waters, C.]|[; ur.011663121557.08; ur.011165307352.00; ur.010664275233.47; ur.015214033732.29; ]|IEEE Network|2006|20|4|16-21|10.1109/mnet.2006.1668399|pub.1061411509|49;[Dwyer, Catherine]|[ur.010203176347.47]|2007 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'07)|2007|||1-10|10.1109/hicss.2007.176|pub.1093855004|98"

First a short introduction on the features of today society often called “knowledge society” is reported, and the problems of digital divide and digital literacy are discussed. Soon after the research project, planned and carried out under the coordination of the University of Florence, for the development of the instruments to be devoted to the construction of a digital competence is drafted. To let the reader better understand how the project situates in the panorama of today studies, a synthesis of the international works on those topics is described, with a special attention to the connections between them and the new generations’ digital basic skills. The description of the general features of the project and of the instruments the author hypothesized for the hitting of the attained results are then discussed, while paying attention to the information systems to be used for the creation of an online testing system and for the management of digital literacy bibliography.

This might seem strange, given that the original sponsor of the event, the Society for Social Studies of Science, is an international, professional association whose members are often thought to advocate various forms of social constructivism. The conference brought together active scholars, who do research on global and national ICT issues, with policy makers, program managers, and senior organizational leaders. One of the constants throughout the three days of the meeting is not any particular theoretical, organizational, or ideological advocacy, but an overarching sense that the past, present, and future of research in an information society must include not only innovations in information technologies themselves, but also the ways in which these technologies interact with and are constituted by the social, political, and developmental contexts in which they are embedded.

pub.1091789130,10.1002/9781405186407.wbiecp026.pub2,Personal Publishing,"Personal publishing – publishing by an individual or small group, generally not for profit and not aimed at a mass audience – has occurred for centuries. In its early years it took the form of, e.g., small‐scale pamphleteering, the circulation of diaries within faith‐based or friendship communities, or the publication of books of family history or autobiography using the “vanity” press (publishers whose income comes primarily from authors). Because of the economics of publishing, until recently these practices were not available to a broad range of people and the circulation of these texts was limited. With the advent of the personal computer, photocopier, and inexpensive desktop publishing tools, however, small‐scale personal publication became easier and a variety of small‐scale magazines sprang up (→ Zines). It has been the diffusion of access to the Internet in recent years across much of the world (→ Digital Divide), however, that has enabled a flourishing of online personal publishing and inspired a greater academic focus on this area. This started with personal Internet home pages in the mid‐1990s and has continued in the form of the “weblog” (a site consisting of items published in reverse chronological order) and, most recently, of profiles on social networking services (SNSs) like Facebook.",The International Encyclopedia of Communication,2011,,,,"Brake, David",University of Bedfordshire,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091789130,0,"[Sprengnether, Madelon; Culley, Margo; Iles, Teresa; Stanley, Liz]|[ur.012102063341.08; ; ; ]|The Women's Review of Books|1993|10|5|13|10.2307/4021452|pub.1102994813|34;[Brake, David R]|[ur.012272512141.08]|SocArXiv|2016||||10.31235/osf.io/mrq9v|pub.1108951988|9"

The influence of a general practitioner's encouragement and reasons for nonuse of the service were investigated.

pub.1061600178,10.1109/tem.2005.844464,Drivers of E-Business Activity in Developed and Emerging Markets,"This paper presents the results of an empirical analysis of the determinants of e-business activity across a sample of 26 developed countries and 52 emerging markets. Several “e-readiness” indicators predict actual e-business activity, including Internet infrastructure, computer infrastructure, affordable telephone service, literacy rates, English language capabilities, and logistics infrastructure. No support was found for a linkage between e-business and institutional factors (i.e., country risk, economic freedom, and transparency) or payment infrastructure. Moreover, evidence of path dependence suggests that sustainable first-mover advantages are conveyed upon early adopters of Internet technologies. Important regional differences also exist, with Asia leading other emerging markets and Eastern Europe lagging. Finally, analysis of a subsample of countries suggests that entrepreneurship rates drive e-business activity. The results document the persistence of the global digital divide and support a broad view of e-readiness, whereby a country's e-business activity depends not only upon information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure but also upon human capital and logistics infrastructure. The absence of a link between institutional factors and e-business suggests that e-business arises not only when supporting economic institutions exist but also as a means of overcoming inadequate institutional conditions.",IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2005,52,2,155-166,"Di.

pub.1061558366,10.1109/tcomm.2011.122110.090426,Power-Constrained Physical-Layer Goodput Maximization for Broadband Power Line Communication Links,"Power Line Communication (PLC) systems are currently envisioned as a possible solution for distributing multimedia contents and allowing Internet access with a capillary (already built) network without demanding further infrastructure. The real challenge for PLCs consists in providing connectivity where Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN)-based Internet Access and/or Wi-Fi/WiMAX seem to be unable to solve the problem of Digital Divide. In this paper we introduce a new metric, i.e. the goodput, to balance transmission rate and bit error rate (BER) in resource allocation issues for Power Line Communication systems. In detail, we state the well-known integer bit-loading problem as a goodput maximization with constraints on the power consumption and the maximum decoding time. The use of Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) allows to pursue the goodput maximization weighing error probability and transmission rate which would have otherwise been in trade-off. Numerical results are presented to stress how our solution improves system performances, both in ideal conditions and with additional impairments such as crosstalk and impulsive noise, with respect to the conventional Maximum Rate (MR) and Minimum BER (MB) approaches and to validate the suitability of TCMs in comparison with higher complexity codes.",IEEE Transactions on Communications,2011,59,3,695-700,"Biagi, M; Polli, V; Patriarca, T",Sapienza University of Rome,Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1061558366,11,"[Ermolova, N.

Legal theory is clearly affected by these changes. Yet there is no rush to publish on e-government in leading legal theory journals, and there is no visible surge in student demand for courses in e-government. Just as only some areas of governments in developed states have taken advantage of new information communication technologies, so only some areas of legal theory have engaged e-government. Issues in Internet governance and personal privacy dominate legal theory’s engagement with e-government, while e-engagement of citizens plays an increasingly important yet still limited role in governments’ interaction with citizens. Yet there are signs that this gentle pace may soon change, as leading jurisdictions approach completion of the first wave of service transformation at the same time as concerns regarding a digital divide recede under the growth of access to new information communication technologies. New opportunities for e-government may soon make e-government’s progress revolutionary rather than evolutionary, and legal theory will be forced to keep pace.",Electronic Government,2008,,,3738-3746,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Culver, Keith",University of New Brunswick,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1031843398,0,

In fact, they need to be e-ready to benefit from what is known as the digital society. The rapidity of technological advances is, in fact, pushing many developing countries digitally far behind. However, as of now, it is well accepted that the digital divide is not merely about technology deprivation, but is also about many inter-related social, educational, cultural, political and economic issues. Understanding its subtle nuances in the context of different parts of the developing world is extremely important to address the problem in a meaningful way. This paper is about an action research done in the district of Barkha in the Sultanate of Oman, through a pilot IT literacy cam paign. The study reveals that, for evolving a digital society in an Arab region, issues such as linguistic literacy and information literacy are far more challenging than the much publicized computer literacy.

As a first step to this goal, we examined the aging effect and sexual difference on the dynamical properties of pointing movements on a touch-screen. The major results are as follows: 1. Pitts' law (MT=α log_2 D/S+β) did not necessarily hold when the subjects repeated pointing movements between two targets locations on the screen (D is the distance between the targets, S is the size of the target). Rather, the increase in the movement time (MT) was linearly related to the the index of difficulty (ID=D/S), this is, MT=α D/S+β. 2. Coefficient α and intercept β were not significantly different between the movements in left-right direction and in depth direction. 3. No sexual difference was found in the magnitude of α and β. 4.

The study used content analysis to analyze the data obtained from a sample of 19 county veteran service officers (CVSOs) to test the hypotheses. CVSOs use websites to serve veterans on a Government-to-Citizen (G2C) basis. The results show that the different aspects of the relations between CVSOs and veterans fit with the four interrelated balanced scorecard factors. The results also show that three of the four website-supported Balanced Scorecard dimensions (learning and innovation, internal process, and veteran value proposition) have a positive impact on e-government service delivery performance. However, the impact of the fourth website-supported Balanced Scorecard perspective (financial) on e-government service delivery performance is different because of the digital divide among the various generations of veterans.",Journal of Service Science (JSS),2008,1,1,75-82,"Lawson-Body, Assion; Mukankusi, Laurence; Miller, Glenn",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1068750022,1,

In particular, the chapter identifies five key tensions in this context: (1) the tension between the need for quick decisions and the need for analytical decision processes; (2) the tension involving managerial need for action and the need for the safest execution of decisions that may be bold and risky; (3) the tension around empowering middle managers and management teams at various organizational levels in the midst of powerful and impatient top executives; (4) the tension between programmed, quick-action learning loops and the increased requirement for emergence and improvisation; and (5) the tension between expending effort to eliminate the digital divide with other organizations versus finding expedient ways to communicate through heterogeneous digital infrastructures. Each of the tensions, and how it can be managed, is illustrated through a case example. The chapter ends by suggesting that the management of these critical tensions needs to be fused into the day-to-day fabric of management practices for decision support processes.",Information Systems and e-Business Management,2008,6,3,225-237,"Carlsson, Sven A.; El Sawy, Omar A.",Lund University; University of Southern California,Sweden; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037214709,16,"[Eisenhardt, Kathleen M.]|[]|California Management Review|1990|32|3|39-54|10.2307/41166616|pub.1011989336|178;[Sawy, Omar A.

pub.1025893925,10.1108/17422040510595663,Information and communications technology use in British unions,"Purpose Aims to review British labour union leaders’ views on the use and importance of information and communications technology (ICT) within their unions.   Design/methodology/approach An open‐ended e‐mail survey and personal interviews conducted in 2000‐2001 with union leaders provides the primary original data for this research. Responses are content analysed to assess the importance leaders assign to ICT for unions, to review the ways in which ICT is used, and the costs and benefits associated with ICT use. Charts and verbatim quotes are used to summarise respondents’ views. These views are compared and contrasted with data from the USA.   Findings Union leaders were generally enthusiastic about the importance of ICT for unions, citing various examples of ICT‐based benefits to their unions. Some, however, expressed reservations about members’ access to ICT and potential “digital divides”, while others warned that ICT may encourage unions to neglect worker desires for “a human touch” in helping them resolve problems. British union leaders’ views generally reinforce findings from an earlier survey in the USA, although direct comparisons are limited.   Originality/value Provides information on ICT views from a reasonably broad sampling of British union leaders and demonstrates similarity of views across Britain and the USA.",Critical Perspectives on International Business,2005,1,2/3,180-193,"Fiorito, Jack; Royle, M.

The accessibility technologies we have are meeting the needs of only some, at high cost – and will not work with many new technologies. In addition, the pace and path of technological change predestines these approaches to fail in the very near future. At the same time, the incidence of disabilities is increasing as our population ages. The same technical advances however hold the key for a radical paradigm shift in our approach to accessibility that can harness the pace of innovation and have it work for us rather than against us. Proposed is the development of a Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII) that can tap the unprecedented ability to pool resources and match demand with supply enabled by the Cloud to deliver accessibility to every individual where they need it, when they need it and in a way that matches their unique requirements; automatically so that they do not need to negotiate, explain, qualify or justify.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2011,6765,,517-526,"Vanderheiden, Gregg; Treviranus, Jutta",University of Wisconsin–Madison; Ontario College of Art and Design,United States; Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052751493,31,"[Wooldridge, Michael; Jennings, Nicholas R.; Kinny, David]|[ur.013246602463.57; ur.016421526421.87; ur.016602242455.28]|Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems|2000|3|3|285-312|10.1023/a:1010071910869|pub.1027485911|1078;[Cooper, Alan]|[]|Berichte des German Chapter of the ACM|1999|53||17-17|10.1007/978-3-322-99786-9_1|pub.1034051799|730;[Petrie, H.

pub.1034280537,10.1002/meet.14504201201,Are library and information science journals becoming more internationalized? — A longitudinal study of authors' geographical affiliations in 20 LIS journals from 1981 to 2003,"This paper examines journal publications in the field of library and information science (LIS) to assess the level of internationalization in their publications authorship pattern. The international production and communication of scholarly knowledge is crucial to the growth of a discipline. Recent advancement in communication technology and the rise of globalization have led to the hope of a more balanced flow of scientific knowledge. Nevertheless, scholars also cautioned the possibility of a global digital divide and a widening knowledge gap. This study analyzed the geographical affiliations of authors in 20 international LIS journals to track the longitudinal changes in LIS authorship pattern. Findings suggest an increase in the internationalization of LIS authorships over the years. However, the LIS authorship distribution was still highly uneven in 2003 (Gini coefficient = 0.95). Economic power is still found to be a moderate predictor of publication performance. The findings of this study suggest that, at the moment of the writing, there is still room for the LIS field to be more internationalized. Further research is needed to identify the barriers in international scholarly communication and to explore the implications of such a communication pattern on scientific development and global equality.",Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,2006,42,1,n/a-n/a,"Sin, Sei‐Ching Joanna",University of Wisconsin–Madison,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034280537,10,"[Koehler, Wallace]|[ur.07570271001.46]|Scientometrics|2001|51|1|117-132|10.1023/a:1010516712215|pub.1002932118|35;[Zitt, M.; Bassecoulard, E.]|[ur.014721230657.52; ur.013555556563.93]|Scientometrics|1998|41|1-2|255-271|10.1007/bf02457982|pub.1006894695|54;[Zitt, Michel; Perrot, François; Barré, Rémi]|[ur.014721230657.52; ; ur.012774260331.71]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|1998|49|1|30-42|10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(1998)49:1<30::aid-asi5>3.0.co;2-3|pub.1008086162|35;[Frame, J.

pub.1003608640,10.1016/b978-044452198-9.50039-2,"8.3 Ethical, Legal and Social Aspects of Systems","This chapter outlines some of the most important laws, ethical principles, and guidelines that may assist the system administrator in fulfilling his or her professional duties. Technology has brought many benefits, but is also the cause of many social and ethical concerns: system failures, the destruction of property, the so-called digital divide, workplace monitoring, Internet censorship, and the increasing gap between rich and poor, are some examples of important ethical questions that arise when we reflect on how technology has impacted modern life. A system administrator's duties and responsibilities encompass more than technical knowledge. They are given broad access to the resources of computer systems because their job responsibilities require such access. Many companies have codes of ethics for employees who in the nature of their job have privileged access to company systems. System administrators are often faced with ethical dilemmas in situations, where they must make decisions and take proper action. There are many paths to becoming a system administrator, and many lack formal education. Decisions may therefore often be founded on intuition, or be taken under pressure.

pub.1032974222,10.1007/s11042-009-0415-4,A DVB-MHP web browser to pursue convergence between Digital Terrestrial Television and Internet,"In the last decade with the growth of Interactive Digital Television (IDTV) we have seen the end of passive television. An example of this trend is Internet access through television by means of the last generation Set Top Boxes (STBs). The chance to enjoy web contents through digital television Set Top Boxes, delivering a satisfying browsing experience across this platform, could provide the opportunity to promote social inclusion and bridging the “digital divide”. In this paper we present WebClimb, a web browser that would pursue an effective integration of Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) and Internet in the DVB-MHP platform. WebClimb is a Java-based web browser that enables users to browse the web by interacting with an easy to use Graphical User Interface (GUI), driven by a common TV remote control without asking for reformatting such a content on the server side. In addition to this, the main requirement has been to design and develop an MHP browser application to be broadcast through a TV channel and not embedded in a specific device, though it could be too. Experimental results and a comparison with other possible solutions are provided.",Multimedia Tools and Applications,2009,50,2,381-414,"Amerini, Irene; Ballocca, Giovanni; Becarelli, Rudy; Borri, Roberto; Caldelli, Roberto; Filippini, Francesco",University of Florence; CSP Innovazione nelle ICT (Italy),Italy; Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032974222,5,"[Cesar, Pablo; Bulterman, Dick C.

pub.1028918496,10.1145/1509096.1509178,To reinforce or to mobilize?: tracing the impact of internet use on civic engagement in Taiwan,"Since the 1990s, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have become popular instruments for delivering government services, encouraging citizen participation, and improving public trust. However, although governments around the globe have made enormous investments in e-Government initiatives, whether these efforts do indeed promote greater civic engagement is still under fierce debate between those optimistic and those pessimistic about technology's potential to change the way governments interact with the populace. This paper attempts to figure out whether the Internet can encourage civic engagement and whether its effect is ""reinforcing"" or ""mobilizing"" by analyzing Taiwanese national survey data. The findings show that ICTs appear to have a reinforcing, rather than mobilizing effect. These technologies encourage only those people who are already active in so-called real-world civic engagements to interact with their governments online. At the end of this paper, four policy recommendations are proposed, namely: (1) keeping spending resources that could engage people in ways other than technology; (2) allocating more resources to address the digital divide; (3) focusing future e-Government initiatives in Taiwan more strongly on users; and (4) including a synchronized reform in these initiatives between the online interface and offline back-office.",Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance - ICEGOV '08,2008,,,394-401,"Chen, Don-Yun; Lee, Chung-Pin",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028918496,8,"[Park, Hun Myoung]|[ur.07710534707.27]|Proceedings of the 2006 national conference on Digital government research  - dg.o '06|2006|||440-441|10.1145/1146598.1146739|pub.1000948569|4;[Adler, Richard P.; Goggin, Judy]|[; ]|Journal of Transformative Education|2005|3|3|236-253|10.1177/1541344605276792|pub.1011859473|390;[BARBER, BENJAMIN R.]|[]|Political Science Quarterly|1998|113|4|573-589|10.2307/2658245|pub.1022383052|137;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]|International Journal of Electronic Government Research|2005|1|1|19-39|10.4018/jegr.2005010102|pub.1031965866|38;[Cooper, Terry L.]|[]|Public Administration Review|2005|65|5|534-535|10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00480.x|pub.1039972348|42;[Weichert, Stephan A.]|[ur.012777421765.28]|Publizistik|2007|52|1|130-131|10.1007/s11616-007-0056-4|pub.1040972288|29;[Delli Carpini, Michael X.]|[ur.011572342733.26]|Political Communication|2000|17|4|341-349|10.1080/10584600050178942|pub.1050238914|387;[Jennings, M.

However, the problems of the Internet age such as the digital divide, network criminals and the insecurity of privacy prevent many people from seeing the benefits of the Internet. To solve the problems, we have been studying a methodology which aims at developing a cognitive agent which supports the social activities of a person based on a symbiotic relationship between the person and the agent. The symbiotic relationship means that the person and the agent are tightly coupled in a ubiquitous environment and keep their partnership to support each other, according to Licklider’s symbiosis. In this chapter, we propose a concept of a symbiotic agent and an agent model to design and implement functions defined in the symbiotic agent. To realize the concept, we have implemented an agent platform to run multi-agent systems consisting of primitive agents using Steel Bank Common Lisp running on Linux and MacOS.",Studies in Computational Intelligence,2010,323,,13-32,"Fujita, Shigeru; Sugawara, Kenji; Moulin, Claude",Chiba Institute of Technology; Heuristics and Diagnostics for Complex Systems,Japan; France,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015104041,0,"[Weiser, Mark]|[]|Scientific American|1991|265|3|94-104|10.1038/scientificamerican0991-94|pub.1002170344|5693;[Suganuma, Takuo; Sugawara, Kenji; Kinoshita, Tetsuo; Hattori, Fumio; Shiratori, Norio]|[ur.016243323055.84; ur.016213273371.20; ur.016666131775.78; ur.012056142121.10; ur.013550617101.54]|International Journal of Cognitive Informatics and Natural Intelligence|2009|3|1|34-56|10.4018/jcini.2009010103|pub.1004499792|19;[Griffith, Douglas; Greitzer, Frank L.]|[ur.012707001632.27; ur.013557512316.60]|International Journal of Cognitive Informatics and Natural Intelligence|2007|1|1|39-52|10.4018/jcini.2007010103|pub.1016512600|24;[Uchiya, Takahiro; Maemura, Takahide; Hara, Hideki; Sugawara, Kenji; Kinoshita, Tetsuo]|[ur.012763754552.63; ur.016401764002.50; ur.07623336775.02; ur.016213273371.20; ur.016666131775.78]|International Journal of Cognitive Informatics and Natural Intelligence|2009|3|1|57-74|10.4018/jcini.2009010104|pub.1016924157|25;[Dijkstra, Edsger W.]|[ur.015650162243.26]|Communications of the ACM|1975|18|8|453-457|10.1145/360933.360975|pub.1027436553|1336;[Kinsner, Witold]|[ur.01026077006.94]|International Journal of Cognitive Informatics and Natural Intelligence|2007|1|1|28-38|10.4018/jcini.2007010102|pub.1030525612|45;[Wang, Yingxu]|[ur.012057635103.90]|International Journal of Cognitive Informatics and Natural Intelligence|2007|1|1|1-27|10.4018/jcini.2007010101|pub.1038649360|265;[Hansen, Per Brinch]|[ur.0712606330.31]|Communications of the ACM|1978|21|11|934-941|10.1145/359642.359651|pub.1046839046|380;[Lyytinen, Kalle; Yoo, Youngjin]|[ur.015577330504.48; ur.01036574214.97]|Communications of the ACM|2002|45|12|62-65|10.1145/585597.585616|pub.1051518157|223;[Maes, P.]|[ur.011462730502.42]|IEEE Intelligent Systems|1996|11|6|62-63|10.1109/64.546584|pub.1061205182|5;[Licklider, J.

The rapid growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web, and proliferation of personal computers increased our productivity, brought to life new business models, created armies of virtual millionaires and real losers, and reduced the World to a size of the global village. Today a person in Central Africa is capable of accessing the same information, use the same e-commerce vendors, and trade on-line as a person in the United States. This enormous progress still leaves most people on Earth including most of the populations of developed countries deprived of access to information that could greatly improve their lives. It is the well known today ""Digital Divide"" phenomenon. To include most of the mankind into the new economy we must address the specificity of consumer, mass market information networking. We present examples of mass market information access services as well as home networking applications and home information infrastructure management schemes. We offer a view on the consumer communications value chain composition that insures user-friendly mechanism for provisioning, service creation, and support of the home networking environments as well as their integration into the information infrastructure.",Proceedings 15th International Conference on Information Networking,2001,,,10-11,"Gelman, A.D.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093961557,0,
pub.1052463847,10.1017/cbo9780511510595.010,Ecological Panel Inference from Repeated Cross Sections,"ABSTRACT This chapter presents a Markov chain model for the estimation of individual-level binary transitions from a time series of independent repeated cross-sectional (RCS) samples. Although RCS samples lack direct information on individual turnover, it is demonstrated here that it is possible with these data to draw meaningful conclusions on individual state-to-state transitions. We discuss estimation and inference using maximum likelihood, parametric bootstrap, and Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches. The model is illustrated by an application to the rise in ownership of computers in Dutch households since 1986, using a 13-wave annual panel data set. These data encompass more information than we need to estimate the model, and this additional information allows us to assess the validity of the parameter estimates. We examine the determinants of the transitions from have-not to have (and back again) using well-known socioeconomic and demographic covariates of the digital divide. Parametric bootstrap and Bayesian simulation are used to evaluate the accuracy and the precision of the ML estimates, and the results are also compared with those of a first-order dynamic panel model.

pub.1044665050,10.1080/01972240601057254,ICT Inclusion and Gender: Tensions in Narratives of Network Engineer Training,"Government, major information and communications technology (ICT) companies, and educational institutions in the United Kingdom currently claim that ICT skills training offers inclusion into the new economy. We focus on a private–public training initiative and its impact on the socially excluded, specifically lone women parents. Narrative data from four United Kingdom educational sites participating in this computer network engineer training program highlight a systemic paradox: that ICT skills development initiatives designed to support lone women parents are simultaneously working in opposition to broader policy goals such as work–life balance and ironically serve to reproduce the participants' classification as socially excluded. The assumptions underpinning the model of social inclusion driving the ICT skills training course are analyzed critically using the concepts of community of practice, classificatory systems, and marginalization. Our findings suggest that ICT training courses and initiatives should be accompanied by changes in pedagogic practice that accommodate the more wide-ranging needs of those targeted for inclusion, as well as changes in employment settings. We conclude by exploring the implications of this for government policy formation, business vendor qualifications, the design of ICT skills training initiatives, and our understanding of the role of ICT skills in overcoming the digital divide.",The Information Society,2007,23,1,19-37,"Gillard, Hazel; Mitev, Nathalie; Scott, Susan",London School of Economics and Political Science,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1044665050,16,"[Woodfield, Ruth]|[ur.013732361377.10]|Information Technology and People|2002|15|2|119-138|10.1108/09593840210430561|pub.1001078003|45;[Kvasny, Lynette; Trauth, Eileen M.]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.07421642022.90]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2003|110||273-291|10.1007/978-0-387-35634-1_14|pub.1001667144|19;[Ahuja, M K]|[ur.016641162325.57]|European Journal of Information Systems|2002|11|1|20-34|10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000417|pub.1002600746|238;[Strover, Sharon]|[ur.012341524001.11]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|275-277|10.1080/01972240309481|pub.1004177104|40;[Adam, Alison; Howcroft, Debra; Richardson, Helen]|[ur.014361323573.45; ur.016605367631.14; ur.015754264573.16]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2001|66||333-352|10.1007/978-0-387-35489-7_22|pub.1006872275|16;[Herring, Susan C.]|[]|The Information Society|1999|15|3|151-167|10.1080/019722499128466|pub.1007746674|137;[Taylor-Gooby, Peter]|[ur.0777003163.46]|Journal of European Social Policy|1991|1|2|93-105|10.1177/095892879100100202|pub.1008284535|89;[]|[]|Work-Life Balance in the 21st Century|2005||||10.1057/9780230373594|pub.1016282864|34;[Wilson, Melanie]|[]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2001|66||353-365|10.1007/978-0-387-35489-7_23|pub.1018398755|2;[Wilhelm, Anthony G.]|[]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|279-286|10.1080/01972240309482|pub.1025361280|10;[Milbourne, Linda]|[]|International Journal of Inclusive Education|2002|6|4|325-343|10.1080/13603110210148621|pub.1026070139|15;[Houston, Diane M.]|[]|Future of Work|2005|||1-10|10.1057/9780230373594_1|pub.1027975076|8;[Mishra, Ramesh]|[]|Social Policy and Administration|1998|32|5|481-500|10.1111/1467-9515.00110|pub.1028339873|31;[Trauth, Eileen M.]|[ur.07421642022.90]|Information Technology and People|2002|15|2|98-118|10.1108/09593840210430552|pub.1031754111|187;[Wilhelm, Anthony]|[]|The Information Society|2002|18|5|415-416|10.1080/01972240290108212|pub.1033341892|7;[Wilson, Melanie]|[]|Information Technology and People|2002|15|2|139-158|10.1108/09593840210430570|pub.1036465033|47;[Robertson, Maxine; Newell, Sue; Swan, Jacky; Mathiassen, Lars; Bjerknes, Gro]|[ur.012656613513.36; ur.010643725351.91; ur.014427207751.43; ur.01206570775.33; ur.011570131305.55]|Information Systems Journal|2001|11|2|111-126|10.1046/j.1365-2575.2001.00098.x|pub.1037188029|39;[O'Neil, Dara V.; Baker, Paul M.

The Adoption-Citizen Intention Model by Shareef, Kumar, Kumar, and Dwivedi (2009), validated in another developing country, Bangladesh, was used to carry out the empirical investigation. The results of the empirical investigation did not reveal much difference between the intentions of an Indian citizen and a Bangladeshi citizen to adopt e-government. Perceived ease of use, perceived security, and perceived reliability were found to highly influence Indian citizens’ intentions to adopt e-government. However, it was found that the criteria for e-government adoption in developing countries differs from that of developed countries where relative advantage and the perceived image of e-government increase citizens’ intentions to adopt e-government (Carter & Belanger, 2005). Dissimilarities in social attitude, cultural behavior, e-readiness, and the digital divide between developing countries and developed countries might help explain the difference in intentions of citizens to adopt e-government.",Integrated Series in Information Systems,2010,25,,371-389,"Shareef, Mahmud A.; Archer, Norm; Sharan, Vedmani; Kumar, Vinod",McMaster University; Carleton University,Canada; Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023362824,2,"[Liljander, Veronica; van Riel, Allard C.

pub.1009748992,10.1007/978-0-387-09712-1_3,A normative approach to democracy in the electronic government framework,"The process of modernization in the public administrations is considered to be the result of the implementation of computer science applications and digital technologies in the Public Administration (PA) for achieving institutional functions. The so called “electronic government” is one of the key objectives laid out in DG Information Society’s i2010 Action plan, in which Europe aims to bring administrations closer to citizens, for example by providing on line public services. In this scenario of changing of means and goals, the electronic dialogue between agents – i.e. Public Administrations, citizens and enterprises – represents the key element for the development of the public sector. But e-government is neither a simple tool to provide better services in a better way by PA. to citizens nor a simple question of downsizing the administration (the back office) and up-sizing services (the front-office) – i.e. a rebalancing from administration to services on a planned and sensible basis. Modern democracies are facing new challenges through the communication and information technology. The expression “electronic democracy” is characterized by the modality of citizens direct participation in the political life. In truth, this expression evokes wider and universal values.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2008,280,,21-29,"Maggipinto, Andrea; Visconti, Ezio",University of Bologna,Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009748992,2,"[Schmitter, Philippe C.]|[ur.011662600353.11]|Participatory Governance|2002|||51-69|10.1007/978-3-663-11003-3_3|pub.1051854780|121;[Cruikshank, Barbara]|[]||1999||||10.7591/9781501733918|pub.1122354213|912"

While the use of cellular technologies can cut down on the time to deploy access networks, the cost economics make this non-viable in growing telecom economies. In the Digital Gangetic Plains (DGP) project, we are exploring the use of 802.11 as a long-distance access technology. 802.11 is currently cost-priced due to competitive mass production and hence is attractive for low cost and rapid deployment in rural areas.We have built an extensive testbed in a rural setting consisting of multi-hop directional 802.11 links, the testbed spanning up to 80km at its longest. To our knowledge such a long-distance, multi-hop testbed based on 802.11 is unique thus far. While 802.11 is attractive in terms of cost economics, it was inherently designed for indoor use. Our novel use of the technology for outdoor, long-distance access links presents several challenges. Our experience with the testbed has brought several research as well as operational issues to the fore. In this paper, we describe the novel technical challenges that lie ahead in using 802.11 to bridge the digital divide.",ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2004,34,1,33-38,"Bhagwat, Pravin; Raman, Bhaskaran; Sanghi, Dheeraj",Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur,India,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049315576,85,

Legal theory is clearly affected by these changes. Yet there is no rush to publish on e-government in leading legal theory journals, and there is no visible surge in student demand for courses in e-government. Just as only some areas of governments in developed states have taken advantage of new information communication technologies, so only some areas of legal theory have engaged e-government. Issues in Internet governance and personal privacy dominate legal theory’s engagement with e-government, while e-engagement of citizens plays an increasingly important yet still limited role in governments’ interaction with citizens. Yet there are signs that this gentle pace may soon change, as leading jurisdictions approach completion of the first wave of service transformation at the same time as concerns regarding a digital divide recede under the growth of access to new information communication technologies.

Our bandwidth usage, and the typical capacity of the major national backbones and intercontinental links used by our field have progressed by a factor of more than 1000 over the past decade, and the outlook is for a similar increase over the next decade. This striking exponential growth trend, outstripping the growth rates in other areas of information technology, has continued in the past year, with many of the major national, continental and transoceanic networks supporting research and education progressing from a 10 Gigabits/sec (Gbps) backbone to multiple 10 Gbps links in their core. This is complemented by the use of point-to-point “light paths” to support the most demanding applications, including high energy physics, in a growing list of cases.As we approach the era of LHC physics, the growing need to access and transport Terabyte-scale and later 10 to 100 Terabyte datasets among more than 100 “Tier1” and “Tier2” centers at universities and laboratories spread throughout the world has brought the key role of networks, and the ongoing need for their development, sharply into focus. Bandwidth itself on an increasing scale is not enough. Realizing the scientific wealth of the LHC and our other major scientific programs depends crucially on our ability to use the bandwidth efficiently and reliably, with reliable high rates of data throughput, and effectively, where many parallel large-scale data transfers serving the community complete with high probability, often while coexisting with many other streams of network traffic. Responding to these needs, and to the scientific mission, physicists working with network engineers and computer scientists have made substantial progress in the development of protocols and systems that promise to meet these needs, placing our community among the world leaders in the development as well as use of large-scale networks. A great deal of work remains, and is continuing.As we advance in these areas, often (as in the past year) with great rapidity, there is a growing danger that we will leave behind our collaborators in regions with less-developed networks, or with regulatory frameworks or business models that put the required networks financially out of reach. This threatens to further open the Digital Divide that already exists among the regions of the world. In 2002, the SCIC recognized the threat that this Divide represents to our global scientific collaborations, and since that time has worked assiduously to reduce or eliminate it; both within our community, and more broadly in the world research community of which HEP is a part.",Computer Physics Communications,2007,177,1-2,224-230,"Newman, Harvey B.",California Institute of Technology,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016105252,1,

The objective is to appreciate the social and technical needs of this preference so as to narrow the divide developing between these people and those who earn their living from written knowledge sharing. Writing is not the preferred method of knowledge sharing for the majority of peoples on earth nor is it appropriate for the majority of problems. A mix of both literacy and orality is believed to be the ideal, so a failure to develop cheap and relevant synchronous and asynchronous oral knowledge sharing technology may down play the importance of orality in the social and economic development of both the developed and developing nations. This paper will argue that IS designers interested in global diversity, equity, innovation and economic development through communication technology need to place more emphasis on orality. The difference between oral and written knowledge sharing will be discussed to explain the need for both synchronous and asynchronous communication technologies. A small study comparing asynchronous oral and written communication is presented as is an attempt to design an Internet based oral conferencing system to link Aboriginal communities. It was found that there was a need for developing cheap community based conferencing facilities and to improve the asynchronous oral communication technologies.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2003,,,419-434,"Metcalfe, Mike; Joham, Carmen",University of South Australia,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028294261,2,"[Isaacs, William N.]|[]|Organizational Dynamics|1993|22|2|24-39|10.1016/0090-2616(93)90051-2|pub.1000043575|425;[Shirani, Ashraf I; Tafti, Mohammed H.A; Affisco, John F]|[ur.014601303675.05; ur.07471173475.23; ur.012354071553.57]|Information & Management|1999|36|3|139-150|10.1016/s0378-7206(99)00015-4|pub.1004832322|60;[Kock, Ned]|[ur.014323551415.27]|Information Systems Journal|2001|11|2|87-110|10.1046/j.1365-2575.2001.00097.x|pub.1032978583|25;[Lawson, C]|[]|Cambridge Journal of Economics|1999|23|2|151-166|10.1093/cje/23.2.151|pub.1053423980|208;[Savard, Jean - Francois]|[]|Wicazo Sa Review|1998|13|2|83|10.2307/1409148|pub.1069474662|10;[ONG, WALTER J]|[]||1982||||10.4324/9780203328064|pub.1095908898|3128;[Walsham, Geoff; Sahay, Sundeep]|[ur.012623025165.11; ur.012234426741.58]|MIS Quarterly|1999|23|1|39|10.2307/249409|pub.1102515061|342"
pub.1027337564,10.1016/j.giq.2007.08.001,Information asymmetry and information sharing,"Although much digital divide research focuses on access to technology, another cause of the divide is the lack of information awareness that we call information asymmetry. Information asymmetry often stems from inadequate information sharing and can result in negative consequences for both the information poor and the information rich. Information asymmetry has been insufficiently studied as a possible cause of underdevelopment and inequality. In response, we develop a typology to classify information asymmetry into two categories, horizontal and vertical, and then identify those information sharing practices that cause the imbalance. To illustrate the negative consequences of information asymmetry and the potential benefits of information sharing, we discuss two examples from the experiences of modern American Indian tribes. First, Indian tribes face horizontal information asymmetry when they attempt to access the capital markets, and second, they face vertical information asymmetry in terms of law enforcement data sharing. This article also describes our ongoing examination of horizontal information sharing among tribes and vertical information sharing between tribes and others sovereigns in the American polity as possible solutions to the problems created by information asymmetry. These strategic responses are embodied in two information systems, the Tribal Financial Information Clearinghouse and an Intergovernmental Tracking System for sharing law enforcement data. We conclude with a discussion of how our typology can be more generally applied to other instances of information asymmetry.",Government Information Quarterly,2007,24,4,827-839,"Clarkson, Gavin; Jacobsen, Trond E.; Batcheller, Archer L.",University of Michigan–Ann Arbor,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027337564,45,"[de Wet, W.A.]|[ur.010413650741.50]|Economic Modelling|2004|21|4|621-630|10.1016/j.econmod.2003.09.002|pub.1000662353|12;[Hollingshead, Andrea B.; Brandon, David P.]|[ur.013766775165.34; ur.013317233424.43]|Human Communication Research|2003|29|4|607-615|10.1111/j.1468-2958.2003.tb00859.x|pub.1002979488|125;[Van Nieuwerburgh, Stijn; Veldkamp, Laura]|[ur.014753560601.69; ur.014472210425.19]|Journal of Monetary Economics|2006|53|4|753-772|10.1016/j.jmoneco.2005.02.003|pub.1007717826|194;[Flanagin, AJ; Monge, P; Fulk, J]|[ur.016436731062.59; ur.015273277007.83; ur.013307160407.53]|Human Communication Research|2006|27|1|69-93|10.1111/j.1468-2958.2001.tb00776.x|pub.1011802061|20;[Alam, Pervaiz; Walton, Karen Schuele]|[ur.016516117257.18; ur.010610426457.08]|Financial Review|1995|30|2|289-311|10.1111/j.1540-6288.1995.tb00834.x|pub.1014215787|17;[Weiler, Stephan; Scorsone, Eric; Pullman, Madeleine]|[ur.01230603771.14; ur.010654700441.36; ur.012636543602.75]|Growth and Change|2000|31|3|367-384|10.1111/0017-4815.00133|pub.1019707642|9;[Rouleau, Linda]|[ur.01127657562.90]|Journal of Management Studies|2005|42|7|1413-1441|10.1111/j.1467-6486.2005.00549.x|pub.1023873087|586;[Yu, Liangzhi]|[ur.011761531432.32]|Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|2006|38|4|229-252|10.1177/0961000606070600|pub.1028593097|128;[Yuan, Yu; Fulk, Janet; Shumate, Michelle; Monge, Peter R.; Bryant, J.

The Village Telco (VT) is an easy to use and scalable VoIP over meshed WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) telephone infrastructure. It uses a mesh network of mesh potatoes to form a peer-to-peer network to relay telephone calls without landlines or cell phone towers. This paper discusses the Village Telco infrastructure, how it addresses the numerous difficulties associated with wireless mesh networks, and its efficient deployment for VoIP services in some communities around the globe. The paper also presents the architecture and functions of a mesh potato and a novel combined analog telephone adapter (ATA) and WiFi access point that routes calls. Lastly, the paper presents the results of preliminary tests that have been conducted on a mesh potato. The preliminary results indicate very good performance and user acceptance of the mesh potatoes. The results proved that the infrastructure is deployable in severe and under-resourced environments as a means to make cheap phone calls and render Internet and IP-based services. As a result, the VT project contributes to bridging the digital divide in developing areas.",EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking,2011,2011,1,78,"Adeyeye, Michael; Gardner-Stephen, Paul",Cape Peninsula University of Technology; Flinders University,South Africa; Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023164368,30,"[Draves, Richard; Padhye, Jitendra; Zill, Brian]|[ur.011210672335.41; ur.014417577113.96; ur.013103657363.29]|Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking  - MobiCom '04|2004|||114-128|10.1145/1023720.1023732|pub.1000319010|1742;[Cole, R.

We argue that the complexities of web accessibility are best analysed against a set of relevant discourses and that part of the reason for the obduracy of web inaccessibility lies in crucial gaps in engagement of these discourses, so that there is no clear avenue through which disabled people can engage effectively with the web accessibility issue to ensure their rights are met. We characterize the relevant discourses in terms of the digital divide discourse, the social construction of disability discourse, focusing on the historical relationship between disability and technology, the legal discourse where we briefly describe the burdens which disability discrimination demands of those who design websites and the web accessibility discourse, including a discussion of the development of web accessibility standards. We argue that there are crucial gaps in engagement of these discourses, signalling that important groups are not engaged with the dominant policy making agenda. Notably disability activists are not included in the standard making agenda of the web accessibility movement. Unless ways of including such groups can be found, we argue that the current state of web accessibility and hence the potential for social inclusion to be increased is unlikely to be ameliorated.",Information Communication & Society,2009,12,7,1041-1058,"Adam, Alison; Kreps, David",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022551117,36,"[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|New Media & Society|2004|6|3|341-362|10.1177/1461444804042519|pub.1003317453|630;[Shakespeare, Tom]|[]||2006||||10.4324/9780203640098|pub.1021685122|992;[Cooper, Joel; Weaver, Kimberlee D.]|[; ur.0770707336.29]||2003||||10.4324/9781410608932|pub.1034254512|181;[SELWYN, NEIL]|[ur.010274414500.72]|Journal of Social Policy|2002|31|1|1-20|10.1017/s0047279402006487|pub.1035487375|74;[Loader, Brian D]|[]|Cyberspace Divide|1998||||10.4324/9780203169537|pub.1046224590|73;[Rodino-Colocino, Michelle]|[ur.010544206757.45]|New Media & Society|2006|8|3|487-511|10.1177/1461444806064487|pub.1052129786|27;[]|[]|Choice|2003|40|10|40-6100-40-6100|10.5860/choice.40-6100|pub.1073387703|64;[]|[]|Choice|2003|41|01|41-0382-41-0382|10.5860/choice.41-0382|pub.1073389330|74;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]||2001||||10.1017/cbo9781139164887|pub.1098663486|2054;[Engel, David M.; Munger, Frank W.]|[; ]||2003||||10.7208/chicago/9780226208343.001.0001|pub.1099498891|165"

Design/methodology/approach  The paper consists of two parts. First, the technology that enables the project is presented together with policy considerations about why such a technology had to be deployed. An analysis of the results from surveys and interviews is then presented.    Findings  In order to achieve sustainable development of a rural ICT project, which is the key to enabling economic development, it is essential to involve residents' participation. A test‐bed DIY project was constructed in a Japanese rural community in 2004, and surveys were conducted in 2004 and 2006 in order to identify residents' needs and awareness of ICT, determine the information literacy level, and evaluate the attitude toward the acceptance of ICT. Also, individual interviews were conducted to look at the qualitative side of residents' perceptions. In general, the residents were found to be indifferent as far as the statistical significance is concerned. However, insights from individual interviews disclosed some useful factors about how to tackle the digital divide in modern society, including the usefulness of DIY in ICT.    Originality/value  The findings, based on analysis of a unique DIY ICT project, will be of value to operators and regulators.",Info,2008,10,4,46-60,"Uesugi, Shiro",Matsuyama University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007392762,4,"[Uesugi, Shiro]|[ur.015044250247.06]|2004 International Symposium on Applications and the Internet Workshops. 2004 Workshops.|2004|||90-95|10.1109/saintw.2004.1268571|pub.1093919735|2;[]|[]|Technology and Social Inclusion|2004||||10.7551/mitpress/6699.001.0001|pub.1110624278|439;[Compaine, Benjamin M.]|[]|The Digital Divide|2001||||10.7551/mitpress/2419.001.0001|pub.1110922707|242;[]|[]|The Digital Divide|2001||||10.7551/mitpress/2419.003.0028|pub.1110922727|16"

They are to serve as training centers where acquisition of ICT skills and knowledge are provided for underprivileged people and also to bring government services online closer to the people at the grassroots.

This study has significantly greater coverage than previous research, in terms of both time frame and country cases. First, the analysis demonstrates that in the first decade of the information society successful leap-frog countries are few and far between. Second, the relative distribution of personal computers, internet hosts and secure servers among the nations of the world has barely improved over the last decade. Third, contrary to received wisdom, most of the countries that might qualify as successful leap-frog countries are actually among the wealthiest in the world. Finally, while policy reform in the telecommunications sector can sometimes speed the diffusion of digital communication tools, the record of market reforms is mixed, and the overall effect of economic wealth is still paramount. In sum, a few poor countries have leapt ahead in the development of a few aspects of ICT infrastructure and use, but these relatively rare successes are more likely to be due to economic productivity than to privatization, regulatory separation and depoliticization, or market liberalization in the telecommunications sector.",Information Communication & Society,2007,10,2,133-157,"Howard, Philip N.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001108200,30,"[Henisz, Witold J.;

The mental aspects are computer anxiety (operation anxiety, computer avoidance and technology anxiety), and the skill aspects are handling skills of mobile phone functions and information handling skills. In order to examine the research questions, surveys (questionnaire method) were conducted on university students. As a result, users that mainly access the internet and e-mail through mobile phones feel stronger operation and technology anxiety than users who use both PCs and mobile phone for internet access and e-mail. Users that mainly access the internet and e-mail through mobile phones do so because 1) they experience anxiety when using a PC and 2) feel that PCs have a negative influence on society. Users that mainly access the internet and e-mail through mobile phones need to overcome these two aspects of computer anxiety for implementing PC use. No significant difference exists in skills between users that mainly access the internet and e-mail through mobile phones and those that use both PCs and mobile phones.

In cloud computing, the end-users can access fully functional software and services online at little or no cost using inexpensive computers or mobile communication devices that connect them via the Internet. Innovative service providers no longer need to own and maintain development or production infrastructures and can automatically scale their production operations to meet growing demand much more easily and economically than possible with internal data centers, traditional hosting, or managed services arrangements. The cloud’s inherent ability to dynamically scale up or scale down the infrastructure commitment as demand changes on a pay-as-you-go basis has a positive impact on the service provider’s overhead costs, energy costs, and in reducing its carbon footprint.Cloud economics as presented in this chapter refers to the economic forces, business drivers, and structural issues affecting the broad costs and benefits of adopting the cloud technologies or the creation of private or public utility clouds.

pub.1037427703,10.1002/meet.1450430135,Making a dent? Information literacy instruction in Canada's public libraries,"This poster presents results of Canada's only recent study of information literacy (IL) practices in public libraries. The overall objective of this project was to explore the actual and potential role of public libraries in Canada in developing the public's information literacy skills. A skills deficit exists among the general population, ironically in parallel with much (misplaced) confidence about those skills; that deficit is a kind of second-level digital divide (Hargittai, 2002). Thus, access to digital information in particular is compromised in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Despite an urgent need to develop IL skills, and expectations that public libraries fulfill that role (Canadian Library Association, 1998) (imposed by the federal government ‘Connecting Canadians’ initiative, particularly via the Community Access Program) (Government of Canada, 2006), the author's previous research suggested that the real experiences of public librarians and of public library customers may not bear out this expectation. Public libraries are challenged to fulfill the policy roles imposed by the federal government, because of a systemic lack of resources, because public libraries attempt to fulfill a range of roles (e.g, social gathering place, developers of early literacy, supporters of life-long learning, supporters of recreational needs), and because library staff are conflicted about imposed mandates in the face of these historical roles.",Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,2007,43,1,1-6,"Julien, Heidi",University of Alberta,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037427703,1,"[Julien, Heidi; Breu, Reegan D.]|[ur.010343333645.73; ]|Library & Information Science Research|2005|27|3|281-301|10.1016/j.lisr.2005.04.002|pub.1042606187|13;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|First Monday|2002|7|4||10.5210/fm.v7i4.942|pub.1072710742|980"

To this end, ?rst, the historical development and major actors of Turkey’s mobile technology market are examined. Following this framework, the current state of government information and services provided by the help of mobile technologies (m-government) is analyzed. Third, several issues related to m-government policy such as health problems that are thought to be caused by mobile phone use and the proximity of mobile phone masts to housing units; the risky behavior of talking via mobile phones while driving and the problems caused by this reckless behavior; problems related to stolen and unregistered mobile phones; and ?nally, the blurring of public and private spheres because of mobile phone use in public places are discussed. Proposed and enacted national legislation on these topics are summarized and discussed. The ?nal section evaluates the future prospects of m-government and integration of electronic government and mobile goverment efforts in Turkey. This section also assesses the possibility of using m-government as a tool for bridging the digital divide in Turkey.",Electronic Government,2008,,,236-248,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Yildiz, Mete",Hacettepe University,Turkey,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028320767,0,
pub.1018211054,10.1007/s10961-009-9119-1,"Determinants of software piracy: economics, institutions, and technology","This paper determines the various influences on software piracy using a large sample of countries. In particular, our cross-sectional study estimates the effects of economic, institutional and technical factors on the piracy of software. A more comprehensive look at potential determinants of software piracy, including economic and non-economic factors, may be considered as the main contribution to a literature that is still in its infancy. Results show that a country’s stage of development and the quality of governance have the largest impact on the incidence of software piracy. Greater economic and political freedoms are shown to have opposite effects on piracy. Further, greater diffusion of the Internet and of computer technologies, other things equal, actually promote the legal use of software. Higher access prices also reduce piracy, with the impact of telephone charges being more pronounced than that of Internet access fees. There are significant variations in the impacts of different types of legal institutions and of fractionalization on piracy.

In this paper, we consider the important issue of planning such networks to the minimize system cost. This is a non-trivial task since it involves several sets of variables: the network topology, tower heights, antenna types to be used and the irorientations, and radio transmit powers. The task is further complicated due to the presence of network performance constraints, and the inter-dependence among the variables. Our first contribution in this paper is the formulation of this problem in terms of the variables, constraints and the optimization criterion. Our second contribution is in identifying the dependencies among the variables and breaking-down the problem into four tractable sub-parts. In this process, we extensively use domain knowledge to strike a balance between tractability and practicality. We have evaluated the proposed algorithms using random input sets as well as real-life instances with success. We have been able to show detailed planning of network topology, required tower heights, antenna types, and transmit powers for the Ashwini project, a long distance WiFi network under deployment in Andhra Pradesh, India, In this case, we are able to achieve within 2% additional cost of a lower bound estimate.",Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web  - WWW '07,2007,,,893-902,"Sen, Sayandeep; Raman, Bhaskaran",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1008980110,61,"[Mishra, Nilesh; Chebrolu, Kameswari; Raman, Bhaskaran; Pathak, Abhinav]|[ur.013064522105.32; ur.014531437405.37; ur.013001337755.41; ur.011162231545.99]|Proceedings of the 15th international conference on World Wide Web  - WWW '06|2006|||761-769|10.1145/1135777.1135893|pub.1010713967|62;[Raman, Bhaskaran; Chebrolu, Kameswari]|[ur.013001337755.41; ur.014531437405.37]|Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking  - MobiCom '05|2005|||156-169|10.1145/1080829.1080847|pub.1018693331|179;[Mishra, Shridhar Mubaraq; Hwang, John; Filippini, Dick; Moazzami, Reza; Subramanian, Lakshminarayanan; Du, Tom]|[; ; ; ; ; ]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2005|3828||184-194|10.1007/11600930_19|pub.1033683850|42;[Chebrolu, Kameswari; Raman, Bhaskaran; Sen, Sayandeep]|[ur.014531437405.37; ur.013001337755.41; ur.013131127015.15]|Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking  - MobiCom '06|2006|||74-85|10.1145/1161089.1161099|pub.1048018261|120;[Brewer, E.; Demmer, M.; Du, B.; Ho, M.; Kam, M.; Nedevschi, S.; Pal, J.; Patra, R.; Surana, S.; Fall, K.]|[ur.0621176610.34; ur.013463377151.21; ur.015672411073.59; ur.011204166163.74; ur.015057310430.44; ur.013327336644.60; ur.010432051166.17; ur.016336613335.90; ur.011033044415.27; ur.07617573671.17]|Computer|2005|38|6|25-38|10.1109/mc.2005.204|pub.1061387336|222"
pub.1093239562,10.1109/inm.2009.5188785,A Rule-based Distributed System for Self-optimization of Constrained Devices,"During the last years there has been a strong research effort on the autonomic communications and self-management paradigms. Following this impulse, the academic community and the industry have proposed several architectures and techniques to allow network devices to make their own configuration decisions. Those proposals often include resource-expensive technologies such as complex inference machines, ontological modeling and probabilistic prediction that may not be suitable for the most pervasive and inexpensive network-enabled devices. This paper addresses this facet of the autonomic systems introducing RAN. This system aims to be a complete rule-based, distributed system specially designed and implemented to enable autonomic behavior on very constrained devices, such as domestic wireless routers with resources as low as 16 MB of RAM and 4 MB of storage memory. The RAN system was developed to serve the objectives of Rural Ambient Networks, a project that targets the so-called Digital Divide deploying low-cost wireless mesh infrastructure in rural communities. In this context, RAN, in autonomic and distributed manners, optimizes the network configuration to minimize the monetary cost that the community has to pay for using the IT infrastructure. Finally, this work presents an evaluation of RAN that shows how it makes possible to perform sophisticated optimization decisions with a very small overhead in terms of CPU and memory.",2009 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management,2009,,,41-48,"Baliosian, Javier; Visca, Jorge; Grampín, Eduardo; Vidal, Leonardo; Giachino, Martín",University of the Republic,Uruguay,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093239562,8,"[Mitidieri, Carlos; Kaiser, Jörg]|[ur.010415354360.97; ur.010646326765.10]|Proceedings of the 2nd international workshop on Distributed event-based systems  - DEBS '03|2003|||1-7|10.1145/966618.966636|pub.1015736727|5;[Kappler, Cornelia; Mendes, Paulo; Prehofer, Christian; Pöyhönen, Petteri; Zhou, Di]|[ur.013002342174.74; ur.013601102351.54; ur.010357243342.39; ur.015174602655.75; ur.07642726705.73]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2005|3457||139-151|10.1007/11520184_11|pub.1052189577|25;[Kumar, M.; Shirazi, B.A.; Das, S.K.; Sung, B.Y.; Levine, D.; Singhal, M.]|[ur.0724276114.01; ur.01202516300.08; ur.012234460346.39; ur.016073674365.19; ur.0663763644.07; ur.010447461557.94]|IEEE Pervasive Computing|2003|2|3|72-79|10.1109/mprv.2003.1228529|pub.1061418190|90;[Caporuscio, M.; Carzaniga, A.; Wolf, A.L.]|[ur.014022644674.64; ur.01171320227.51; ur.016175403051.28]|IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering|2003|29|12|1059-1071|10.1109/tse.2003.1265521|pub.1061788342|106;[Keoh, Sye Loong; Dulay, Naranker; Lupu, Emil; Twidle, Kevin; Schaeffer-Filho, Alberto E.; Sloman, Morris; Heeps, Steven; Strowes, Stephen; Sventek, Joe]|[ur.014542541003.00; ur.016502445101.46; ur.013404167044.28; ur.016063403262.48; ur.016661106103.79; ur.014167643026.41; ur.012155037565.94; ur.010010373147.89; ur.012747526024.46]|2007 Fourth Annual International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Networking & Services (MobiQuitous)|2007|||1-5|10.1109/mobiq.2007.4451009|pub.1093631351|28;[Baliosian, Javier; Serrat, Joan]|[ur.016603073363.16; ur.016011206543.42]|Proceedings.

Point-to-point links are established in the nodes of such networks using high gain directional antennas. Some nodes are directly linked to the wired internet, and the others link to these using a small number of hops.Minimization of system cost is an important objective in these networks, since generally the rural populations are low-paying. The dominant cost in this setting is that of constructing the antenna towers required to achieve Line-of-Sight connectivity. The cost of a tower depends upon its height, which in turn depends upon the length of its links and the physical obstacles along those links. We investigate the problem of selecting which links should be established such that all nodes are connected, while the cost of constructing the antenna towers is minimized. We formulate this as a geometric optimization problem, and develop an efficient approximation algorithm for the problem using techniques from facility location and geometric set cover. Our algorithm stands up well to experimental comparison with a computed lower bound and other approaches tried before. On the theoretical side, we are able to show that our algorithm guarantees a constant approximation factor...",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2011,6784,,107-120,"Garg, Sachin; Kanade, Gaurav",University of Iowa,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041114721,2,"[Sen, Sayandeep; Raman, Bhaskaran]|[ur.013131127015.15; ur.013001337755.41]|Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web  - WWW '07|2007|||893-902|10.1145/1242572.1242693|pub.1008980110|61;[Raman, Bhaskaran; Chebrolu, Kameswari]|[ur.013001337755.41; ur.014531437405.37]|Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking  - MobiCom '05|2005|||156-169|10.1145/1080829.1080847|pub.1018693331|179;[Jain, Kamal; Vazirani, Vijay V.]|[ur.015016415173.01; ur.01023307450.97]|Journal of the ACM|2001|48|2|274-296|10.1145/375827.375845|pub.1028995883|493;[Lev-Tov, Nissan; Peleg, David]|[ur.016650052643.81; ur.012357743251.05]|Computer Networks|2005|47|4|489-501|10.1016/j.comnet.2004.08.012|pub.1034286095|61;[Bhagwat, Pravin; Raman, Bhaskaran; Sanghi, Dheeraj]|[ur.016715233151.32; ur.013001337755.41; ur.07511565611.30]|ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review|2004|34|1|33-38|10.1145/972374.972381|pub.1049315576|85;[Dutta, Partha; Jaiswal, Sharad; Panigrahi, Debmalya; Naidu, K V M; Rastogi, Rajeev; Todimala, Ajay]|[ur.015044273667.72; ur.015100503555.26; ur.010272172167.00; ur.012160714755.54; ur.012634625407.00; ur.013350112224.38]|2007 2nd International Conference on Communication Systems Software and Middleware|2007|||1-8|10.1109/comswa.2007.382461|pub.1093226811|9;[Panigrahi, Debmalya; Duttat, Partha; Jaiswal, Sharad; Naidu, K.

Current work done in this area assumes the use of a particular type of encoding or the availability of particular facilities for the user. We wanted to come up with an implementation that did not require any special features or optimizations in the user end, and would perform just as well in all situations. For this purpose, we picked two case studies to work on in our effort to finding a suitable solution to the problem. While working on these cases, we encountered several problems and had to find our way around these problems. We had to pick and choose from a set of software packages for the one that would best serve our needs. We also had to take into consideration user convenience in using our system, for which we had to keep in mind the diverse demographics of people that might have need for such a system. Finally, we came up with the system, with all the desired features. Some possible future developments also came into mind in the course of our work, which are also mentioned in this paper.","Advances and Innovations in Systems, Computing Sciences and Software Engineering",2007,,,325-330,"Haque, Nafid; Ali, M.

This article explores recent developments in the United Kingdom (UK) which attempt to address this issue, and examines national and local information policy, community networking, and public library policy. It assesses the claim, common in the UK public library community, that the wiring up of the public libraries will have a significant impact on disadvantage, poverty and social exclusion. In particular, it analyses the process of public library networking as it has unfolded since 1997, drawing upon the empirical findings of Open to All? The Public Library and Social Exclusion (Muddiman et al. 2000), a research project funded by the UK Library and Information Commission (now Resource). This research suggests that despite a rhetorical commitment to social inclusion, the technological transformation of UK public library services will result in little more than a modernisation of current services, with little change in overall strategy or user focus. Consequently, it is argued that if public libraries are to reach out to the excluded of the information society, they will need to move beyond a passive preoccupation with access and use technological change as a means towards more active engagement with local communities and disadvantaged users so that the public library will indeed be open to all.",Libri,2001,51,4,183-194,"Dutch, Martin; Muddiman, Dave",Leeds Beckett University,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1017253991,22,"[Moore, Nick]|[]|The Political Quarterly|1997|68|3|276-283|10.1111/1467-923x.00093|pub.1014852000|7;[Smith, Peter]|[]|Vine|1995|Volume 25|Issue 1|15-23|10.1108/eb040555|pub.1022115704|3;[GRAHAM, STEPHEN; MARVIN, SIMON]|[; ]||1995||||10.4324/9780203430453|pub.1039498836|756;[Williamson, Matthew]|[]|Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|2000|32|4|178-186|10.1177/096100060003200403|pub.1048125661|11;[Williamson, M.]|[]|Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|2000|32|4|178-186|10.1177/0961000004244785|pub.1063902147|6;[Carter, Dave]|[]|The Governance of Cyberspace|1997|||136-154|10.4324/9780203360408_chapter_9|pub.1087802750|27"

Today, many more options exist (Figure 1). Hundreds of websites provide health information and opportunities for interaction between patients, doctors and caregivers. Estimates differ, but all surveys show that millions of people search online for health information. A Pew survey estimates that 80% of adult Internet users, about 93 million Americans, searched online for at least one of 16 major health topics (Fox & Fallows, 2003). Baker, Wagner, Signer and Bundorf (2003) estimate that 20% of the US population uses the Internet to find health information. A larger proportion (71%) of older people (50 to 64 years old), compared to 53% of younger people (18 to 29 years old), turn to the Internet for health information (Fox & Rainie, 2002). Although there is a digital divide, use of information technology is not simply decided by race or social class. Safran (2003) found that Medicaid families, who are believed not to use these new technologies, accessed their online Baby CareLink from the hospital, work, library or other public access points.

These include the use of Internet and other ICTs. This is seen as a gigantic step in the alleviation of the different paramount social-economic problems, at the same time, in the transformation of the society and realization of a truly free and democratic world society. The use of technology in bridging this gap is a fundamental advancement because it also brings with it a mutual understanding and elimination of differential powers within communities in both developing and developed countries worldwide. This paper describes how different wireless access technologies can be combined and deployed to facilitate a continuous flow of information, in and out of the marginalized areas in developing countries. It further explains again, the major role of having Internet connectivity in these areas and how it's seen as an improvement in successfully deployment of ICT4D activities. Different technologies such as WiFi, WiMAX and VSAT will be explored and discussed for the best wireless deployment configurations for the Siyakhula Living Lab (SLL).

The extension service requires ICT for effective information delivery. This study examines the frequency of ICT tools usage by agricultural extension agents in Imo State, Nigeria. Data for the study was collected from 57 randomly selected extension agents. Data analysis was by the use of frequency, percentages, mean and t-test. Findings of the study revealed that only mobile phone and computer were frequently used by respondents. The overall mean of 0.89 suggests that ICT tools were not frequently used for extension services and this has grave implications for agricultural development. Based on the findings of the study, the following recommendations were made: there should be adequate provision of computers for all the extension agents. Adequate provision should be made for the maintenance of the ICT facilities and systems. That provision should be made in providing training programme for the extension agents in order to update their knowledge on the latest and new information technology.

Previous evidence on the subject initially presented indicates the prevalence of contrasting aspects: some outstanding positive initiatives and results towards democratization of the internet, as well as the maintenance of great digital inequalities. New evidence on the evolution of internet access and use is also discussed herein, based on analyses of longitudinal data obtained from the Brazilian Census Bureau’s Annual Survey (IBGE/PNAD, 2005, 2008). After describing aspects of increase in access to the internet, we focus on the evolution of different types of everyday life internet uses, particularly those that might contribute to individual and community development. How accesses and uses are gradually incorporating the less privileged sectors of the Brazilian adult population is also considered in the analyses. The results obtained reinforce the previous contrasting evidences: outstanding growth in access and in diversified uses are observed - suggesting intensive appropriation of internet technology and resources by the population - as well as the persistence of great inequalities. These circumstances indicate that the digital divide in Brazil is still a great challenge to be faced through comprehensive and long-term policies and initiatives.",The Journal of Community Informatics,2011,7,1-2,,"Olinto, Gilda; Fragoso, Suely",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140560473,1,

S. Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, 2000). This initiative focused on improving quality and longevity of life, addressing social disparities, promoting small businesses, and providing educational opportunities, among others. As an outgrowth of this initiative, the concept of building an “information society for all” was promoted in the form of universal usability of all electronic and information technology. The long-term goal was to ensure that no one was left behind in terms of inaccessible electronic and information technology. In 1998, congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 19731 with section 508 to require federal agencies to make electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers in electronic and information technology, make available new opportunities for people with disabilities, and encourage the development of technologies that will help achieve these goals (www.section508.gov). The law applies to all federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology. Under section 508, agencies must give disabled federal government employees and citizens access to information that is comparable to the access available to others without disabilities.","Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, Second Edition",2009,,,4047-4052,"Khosrow-Pour, Mehdi; Becker, Shirley Ann",Florida Institute of Technology,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046528817,0,"[Chisholm, Wendy; Vanderheiden, Gregg; Jacobs, Ian]|[ur.011651014221.41; ur.010344251507.52; ]|Interactions|2001|8|4|35-54|10.1145/379537.379550|pub.1021009735|176;[Brewer, Judy]|[]|Proceedings of the international cross-disciplinary workshop on Web accessibility  - W4A|2004|||51-55|10.1145/990657.990667|pub.1036359239|29;[Becker, Shirley Ann]|[ur.0661660014.53]|Communications of the ACM|2005|48|2|102-104|10.1145/1042091.1042127|pub.1050321642|50"

As we wait for the uncertain takeoff of technologies that promise to improve the situation, we propose to explore an approach that is potentially more easily realizable: the use of digital storage media transported by the postal system as a general digital communication mechanism. We shall call such a system a Postmanet . Compared to more conventional wide-area connectivity options, the Postmanet has several important advantages, including wide global reach, great bandwidth potential, low cost, and ease of incremental adoption. While the idea of sending digital content via the postal system is not a new one, none of the existing attempts have turned the postal system into a generic and transparent communication channel that not only can cater to a wide array of applications, but also effectively manage the many idiosyncrasies associated with using the postal system. In the proposed Postmanet, we see two recurring themes at many different levels of the system. One is the simultaneous exploitation of the Internet and the postal system so we can combine their latency and bandwidth advantages. The other is the exploitation of the abundant capacity and bandwidth of the Postmanet to improve its latency, cost, and reliability.",ACM Transactions on Storage,2005,1,2,246-275,"Garg, Nitin; Sobti, Sumeet; Lai, Junwen; Zheng, Fengzhou; Li, Kai; Wang, Randolph Y.; Krishnamurthy, Arvind",Princeton University; Yale University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045182743,9,"[Kaashoek, M.

The next generation of technology represents an unprecedented opportunity to improve the quality of life for groups of users who have previously faced exclusion, such as those with impairments and older citizens. At the same time it risks creating a greater digital divide and further exclusion. How we approach design for this new generation will determine whether or not the third wave will provide positive advances towards an inclusive digital world. We therefore need to put forward both a rationale for inclusive design and provide pointers towards technical development and design practice in support of inclusion. It is our belief that there is not only a strong moral case for design for inclusion but also significant commercial incentive, which may be key to persuading influential players to focus on inclusion.

There are changes to the fundamental mechanisms of public governance including roles of citizens, organisations and government. This study explores the views, roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in promoting eGovernance, with a focus on countries that are in the early stages of developing their ICT strategies.   Design/methodology/approach An exploratory case study approach is used based on the Malaysian experience. A combination of interviews and comments from questionnaires are used to examine government and citizens' viewpoints concerning eGovernment development.   Findings While these are preliminary, the qualitative findings are intended for reflection, as well as, suggestions for action. They include: creating eCitizen partnerships; narrowing the digital divide; finding consensus on structures and roles in an eGovernment strategy. The discussion calls for collective stakeholder involvement of government and citizens as partners in order to promote social inclusion.   Research limitations/implications The study is exploratory and the findings cannot be considered as representative. However, they indicate areas for improvement. A second more robust empirical study is envisaged with more emphasis on application of stakeholder theory and techniques.

The project, which is ongoing into a second phase, was undertaken to find out how and why women use ICTs and how the use (or non-use) affects their lives. This study engages with issues sometimes referred to as the gendered digital divide [6, 7, 5], the recognition that men are participating and benefiting to a greater degree than women in the Information Society [9]. It is recognized that the gender divide is more than a matter of access and use of tools, or designing content. While there is “global agreement that gender equality is essential for building a ‘sustainable, just and developed society’ [WSIS Declaration of Principles 2003]” [9, p. 135], there seems to be a gap in terms of understanding the implications of gender discrimination in relation to the potential benefits to society of the new technologies. This is a problem if societies as a whole are to benefit from ICTs and use them to further their development, if the vision of development pursued is to equitably reflect and fulfill the interests and needs of the population, not only those in positions of power.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2008,282,,363-367,"Buskens, Ineke; Macueve, Gertrudes; Sane, Ibou; Webb, Anne",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018126397,0,

During this time the global impact of information has grown exponentially, both in terms of available information sources and how people use these sources. The members of SIG-III will present a panel looking at the past 25 years of international information issues and SIG-III's role in bringing these issues to ASIS&T as a whole for consideration and debate. Toni Carbo, one of the co-founders of SIG-III, will keynote this retrospection. A look at the past 25 years of international information offers a lens with which to view potential trends and developments in the future. Toni Carbo, Bharat Mehra, Yunfei Du, and Aaron Bowen will present a “state of the union” on aspects of international information and will evaluate trends and developments which may occur during the next 25 years. Toni will examine privacy, security, and trust. Bharat will examine access and development. Yunfei will examine the digital divide and the knowledge gap. Aaron will examine censorship.

The idea is to select, organize, index and distribute useful educational Web contents to schools where the Internet connection is not available. These Web contents can be used by teachers and students to enhance the teaching and learning for many class subjects. We have collaborated with a group of teachers from different high schools in order to gather the requirements for designing our software tools. One of the challenging issues is the variation in computer hardwares and network configuration found in different schools. Some shools have PCs connected to the school’s server via the Local Area Network (LAN). While some other schools have low-performance PCs without any network connection. To support both cases, we provide two solutions via two different search engine tools. These tools support content administrators, e.g., teachers, with the features to organize and index the contents. The tools also provide general users with the features to browse and search for needed information. Since the contents and index are locally stored on hard disk or some removable media such as CD-ROM, the Internet connection is not needed.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2007,4822,,444-453,"Haruechaiyasak, Choochart; Sangkeettrakarn, Chatchawal; Jitkrittum, Wittawat",National Electronics and Computer Technology Center; Thammasat University,Thailand; Thailand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1000738476,0,"[Cutting, D.; Pedersen, J.]|[; ur.014523720467.92]|Proceedings of the 13th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval  - SIGIR '90|1990|||405-411|10.1145/96749.98245|pub.1028683478|105"

These issues have led policymakers to move towards such a society by identifying the objectives, goals and targets. Planning to achieve these objectives needs a real understanding of the current situation, which is obtained by e-readiness assessment measures. There has been a proliferation of e-readiness assessment measures in recent years that each one has a certain objective. This paper elaborates on and categorizes these measures that help scholars and policymakers to (1) select the measures that fit in with their objectives, (2) prevent the repetitive research, (3) identify the defects and flaws of previous measures and correct them in their own measures, and (4) use the experiences of previous measures to construct their own ones. Based on definitions, objectives, dimensions, methods and approaches, in this paper, the measures are categorized and finally, a measure for e-readiness assessment is presented. Since this measure is a convergence of e-readiness assessment measures, the experienced modelers have consensus on it and it is more suitable to measure e-readiness of countries.

The interactions are potentially complex ones. The growth of e-government initiatives can have major impacts on how governments function and government policies can strongly influence the development and implementation of information technologies. The significance of these interactions is reflected in the World Bank's recently announced Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Infrastructure and E-Readiness Assessments Initiative, which will support assessments of countries readiness for electronic business and government. It is also reflected in US and EU sponsored research programs on digital government. These papers respond to the need for research in this area by focusing on a variety of IT developments as they relate to government programs and policy issues. These include such issues as intellectual property rights, security for government systems, the digital divide and problems of limited infrastructure and resources for both citizens and government agencies, as well as the role of government in IT research and development. By dealing with a variety of policy themes, these papers provide a range of valuable insights into the linkages of policy to e-government activities and programs They also illustrate how research and policy analysis can be applied to specific issues within this important area of government innovation.",Proceedings of the 35th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,2002,,,1646-1647,"Cresswell, Anthony; Gisler, Michael; Günter, Matthias","University at Albany, State University of New York; Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property",United States; Switzerland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095510453,0,

The desk research covered the period 1997 to 2001, and covered a number of major countries, including Canada, USA, Member States of the European Union, South Africa, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. The UK was not included in the survey. The targets set by Government are often vague, and few governments seem to have addressed in any thoughtful manner the problems citizens might have with use of technology. An approach along the lines of ‘this is bound to happen’ rather than ‘what sort of society do we really want?’ is a common feature amongst all the approaches examined. The risks of enhancing the digital divide are also rarely explicitly addressed. Comments regarding good initiatives that offer models for other countries to adopt are made. The emergence of government portals is without doubt the most significant development. These provide the facility for personalization by the user. The New Zealand Government’s efforts to ensure that its web sites are useful for citizens who have difficulty spelling and the Canadian Government’s use of minority languages are also noteworthy. The leading countries are Australia, New Zealand, USA and Canada.

Search engines can efficiently serve daily information needs due to the enormous redundancy of relevant resources on the web. For educational and scientific information needs, the web functions much less efficiently: Scientific publishing is built on a culture of unique reference publications, and moreover, documents abound with specialized structures such as technical nomenclature, notational conventions, references, tables, or graphs. Many of these structures are peculiar to specialized communities determined by nationality, research group membership, or adherence to a special school of thought. To keep the much-lamented “digital divide” from becoming a “cultural divide,” we have to make online material more accessible and adaptable to individual users.In this paper, we attack this goal for the field of mathematics where knowledge is abstract, highly structured, and extraordinarily interlinked. Modern, content-based representation formats like OpenMath or content MathML allow us to capture, model, relate, and represent mathematical knowledge object, and thus, make them context-aware and machine-adaptable to the respective user contexts.

Few comparative e-government researchers have addressed e-government services and contents of e-government Websites within the context of MENA countries. This chapter fills in this gap by presenting e-governance as a desired outcome of diffusion of the Internet among MENA countries. It presents comparisons with respect to types of Websites and services, service-oriented features, online executable services, stages of development of e-government service, and e-government rankings of Websites hosted by MENA governments. Results of our analyses suggest that the similarities in e-governance among MENA countries span a number of variables including the stages of development of e-government services provided through Websites. Our recommendations, grounded in careful examination of 230 Websites of 18 MENA nations, could assist them in the provision of better e-government services to their citizens.",Integrated Series in Information Systems,2010,25,,49-69,"Rorissa, Abebe; Potnis, Devendra; Demissie, Dawit","University at Albany, State University of New York; University of Tennessee at Knoxville",United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047171103,2,"[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|Telecommunications Policy|1999|23|10-11|701-718|10.1016/s0308-5961(99)00050-6|pub.1014570506|228;[Affisco, John F.; Soliman, Khalid S.]|[ur.012354071553.57; ur.07737007101.08]|Business Process Management Journal|2006|12|1|13-21|10.1108/14637150610643724|pub.1026265750|69;[La Porte, Todd M.; Demchak, Chris C.; Friis, Christian]|[ur.012432222525.32; ur.014126200101.50; ]|Communications of the ACM|2001|44|1|63-67|10.1145/357489.357509|pub.1029716522|42;[Cohen, Jacob]|[]|Educational and Psychological Measurement|1960|20|1|37-46|10.1177/001316446002000104|pub.1039619716|25285;[Katchanovski, Ivan; La Porte, Todd]|[ur.012367103117.86; ur.013113337022.23]|International Journal of Public Administration|2005|28|7-8|665-681|10.1081/pad-200064228|pub.1040215353|28;[Hu, Yong; Xiao, JingHua; Pang, JiaFeng; Xie, Kang]|[; ; ; ]|Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Electronic commerce  - ICEC '05|2005|||532-538|10.1145/1089551.1089647|pub.1048621407|21;[Wong, Wilson; Welch, Eric]|[ur.0761651145.11; ur.01063475420.42]|Governance|2004|17|2|275-297|10.1111/j.1468-0491.2004.00246.x|pub.1050848239|229;[Moon, M.

At the academic level, universities have a very important role as a means to communicate scientific and cultural achievements. Web publication by scholars is not only a tool for scholarly communication but it is also a means to reach larger audiences and in general a reflection of the performance of the institutions. There have been several efforts to develop web indicators that can ultimately lead to build a university's rankings. This paper presents the Webometric Ranking of World Universities which is built using a combined indicator called WR that takes into account the number of published web pages (S) (twenty‐five percent), the number of rich files, those in pdf, ps, doc and ppt format (R) (12.5 percent), the number of articles gathered from the Google Scholar Database (Sc) (12.5 percent,) and the total number of external inlinks (V) (fifty percent). The results show that there is a larger than expected academic digital divide between higher education institutions in the United States and those in the European Union. This kind of rankings using web indicators should be used to measure universities' performance in conjunction with more traditional academic indicators.",Higher Education in Europe,2008,33,2-3,233-244,"Aguillo, Isidro F.; Ortega, José Luís; Fernández, Mario",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032984532,111,"[Aguillo, Isidro F.; Granadino, Begoña; Ortega, José L.; Prieto, José A.]|[ur.014103405625.26; ur.01301573516.06; ur.016034550507.65; ur.07366055373.46]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2006|57|10|1296-1302|10.1002/asi.20433|pub.1004731067|103;[Cothey, Viv]|[ur.013117160363.61]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2004|55|14|1228-1238|10.1002/asi.20078|pub.1024758135|39;[Ingwersen, Peter]|[ur.016114421536.27]|Journal of Documentation|1998|54|2|236-243|10.1108/eum0000000007167|pub.1032030017|305;[Björneborn, Lennart; Ingwersen, Peter]|[ur.015301034655.63; ur.016114421536.27]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2004|55|14|1216-1227|10.1002/asi.20077|pub.1035969227|217;[van Raan, Anthony F.

pub.1010299913,10.1108/09593840410570267,On the emancipatory role of rural information systems,"The use of information technology in rural and underserved settings is receiving increasing attention because of the immense potential it brings for improving the quality of life and reducing the digital divide. However, high costs coupled with infrastructure and context‐related inhibitors tend to dilute the advantages that are often taken as a set of givens. In this paper we present a case study of a pioneering experience of information system use in a set of villages in southern India. The research proposition for this study is that social processes can form a viable basis for providing sustainability to information communications technology (ICT) initiatives in rural regions. Theoretical support for this study comes from Habermas’ theory of communicative action. Given that such information systems are emancipatory in nature, and given that such information systems face many obstacles, the value added by these systems needs to be assessed in terms of their contribution to social capital in addition to economic value added. Our analysis reveals that social processes can be leveraged to accord viability to ICT setups in rural settings. Many social changes, that may have faced resistance or were unexpected, themselves became the reason for keeping the ICT setup. This is so because these changes form the basis of empowerment and a participatory framework that would have been absent earlier.

It is done by reviewing the awareness and readiness of the products owners who are the regional products champions from all over Thailand. This study also identifies the enabling factors, the limitations, and forecasts the future growth of e-commerce for OTOP Project. Additionally, it is beneficial to both parties; the government and the people in the rural areas, in solving the problem at the grass root level in Thailand. Five hundred products owners were selected from different products categories, 253 out of 500 responded with usable answers. The response rate was 50.6% which is higher than the expected rate for such surveys. The major problems of the existing OTOP production process and business operation are price, lack of funds for stock inventory and piracy of local wisdom. Awareness of e-commerce among these rural people is high but the level of acceptance for the knowledge and technology transferred are rather low, due to the digital divide in Thailand. Most of them are facing the same situations which are about seeking more distribution channels and enhancing more markets.","IEEE International Conference on e-Technology, e-Commerce and e-Service, 2004.

pub.1050347082,10.1177/0340035209359570,Content development in an indigenous digital library: A case study in community participation,"Africa and African libraries and information centres are poorly equipped to make a meaningful contribution to the current global digital knowledge economy. Low local content on the Web retards buy-in from local communities into digital resources and inhibits development of digital skills. A library with content of local relevance will encourage communities to make use of library services, especially if they are empowered to participate in development of the content. Public libraries serving ethnic communities whose histories are locked up in written, pictorial and oral traditions are well positioned to provide a platform for public engagement in the collecting and disseminating of indigenous knowledge in the communities they serve. This paper presents a case study in community participation in developing content for a digital library of local indigenous knowledge. Description of the programme highlights interaction between the library, the community and the technology used. Implementation challenges, results and lessons learnt are discussed and benefits to the community pointed out. In providing an online, contextually-based information service to local communities, public libraries in Africa will ensure future-oriented access to cultural heritage resources through 21 st century information communication technologies (ICTs). The potential to reduce the digital divide will be enhanced and African communities will be introduced to the global information society.",IFLA Journal,2010,36,1,30-39,"Greyling, Elizabeth; Zulu, Sipho",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050347082,10,"[Sithole, Jabulani]|[ur.0670433467.67]|IFLA Journal|2007|33|2|117-123|10.1177/0340035207080304|pub.1018102307|25;[Rowley, Jennifer]|[ur.016317073205.19]|Library Management|2003|24|8/9|433-440|10.1108/01435120310501112|pub.1041223963|42;[Dyson, Laurel Evelyn; Hendriks, Max; Grant, Stephen; Iseke-Barnes, Judy M.; Danard, Deborah]|[; ; ; ur.0702213512.30; ]|Information Technology and Indigenous People|2007|||27-29|10.4018/978-1-59904-298-5.ch003|pub.1050274689|21;[Chisenga, Justin]|[]|Libraries and Information Services towards the Attainment of the UN Millennium Development Goals|2008|||57-72|10.1515/9783598441257.57|pub.1086609539|1;[Lwoga, Edda Tandi; Ngulube, Patrick]|[ur.010304663375.07; ur.011524744671.08]|Libraries and Information Services towards the Attainment of the UN Millennium Development Goals|2008|||73-88|10.1515/9783598441257.73|pub.1086609541|8"
pub.1026985012,10.1007/0-387-34588-4_23,How (Can) Nonusers Engage with Technology: Bringing in the Digitally Excluded,"This paper describes findings from the Penceil Project, which aims to explore the experiences of nonusers and minimal users of ICTs, how nonuse affects their inclusion or exclusion from society, and how they can learn to use ICTs to meet their personal goals. The paper considers the applicability of the technology adoption model (TAM) to understanding the experiences of this group of people. By looking at theories of social exclusion and the project research findings, the paper argues that TAM is limited in the range of social conditions it anticipates and, thus, presumes a facility in formulating aspirations for use that people excluded from the use of ICTs cannot have. We argue that we need to consider engagement with technology rather than just adoption. We consider the implications of these findings for designing a revised basic ICT curriculum and describe the piloting of a new curriculum. We argue that, as ICTs in general—and Internet use in particular—are experienced technologies, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use need to be reformulated to recognize limitations on people’s ability to construct plans for future action since an actor’s world is disclosed through action not given in advance.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2006,208,,347-364,"Cushman, Mike; Klecun, Ela",London School of Economics and Political Science,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026985012,30,"[Kvasny, Lynette; Keil, Mark]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.013136272710.25]|Information Systems Journal|2006|16|1|23-53|10.1111/j.1365-2575.2006.00207.x|pub.1000107294|158;[Devins, David; Darlow, Alison; Smith, Vikki]|[ur.015323153775.54; ur.015035161505.02; ur.011243517747.40]|Regional Studies|2002|36|8|941-945|10.1080/0034340022000012360|pub.1009534134|14;[Cornford, Tony; Klecun-Dabrowska, Ela]|[ur.0751026411.53; ur.0741234155.55]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2003|||291-305|10.1007/978-0-387-35695-2_18|pub.1009646881|6;[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|Technology in Society|2003|25|1|99-116|10.1016/s0160-791x(02)00062-3|pub.1017627654|221;[Milbourne, Linda]|[]|International Journal of Inclusive Education|2002|6|4|325-343|10.1080/13603110210148621|pub.1026070139|15;[Ajzen, Icek]|[ur.011652717561.39]|Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|1991|50|2|179-211|10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-t|pub.1028082114|43112;[Chatman, Elfreda A.]|[ur.013651330727.81]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|1996|47|3|193-206|10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(199603)47:3<193::aid-asi3>3.0.co;2-t|pub.1030071908|348;[Trentin, Guglielmo]|[ur.012453711657.47]|Journal of Computer Assisted Learning|2004|20|1|21-30|10.1111/j.1365-2729.2004.00061.x|pub.1030614648|16;[Introna, Lucas D.]|[ur.014523651252.94]|Information Systems Series|1997||||10.1007/978-1-349-14549-2|pub.1032711998|150;[]|[]|Handbook of Critical Information Systems Research|2005||||10.4337/9781845426743|pub.1036154872|39;[LIVINGSTONE, SONIA]|[ur.014400337707.47]|The Communication Review|2004|7|1|3-14|10.1080/10714420490280152|pub.1043852700|456;[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|Information Communication & Society|2003|6|3|350-375|10.1080/1369118032000155285|pub.1050726915|16;[Hubregtse, Sjaak]|[]|New Library World|2005|106|3/4|164-172|10.1108/03074800510587363|pub.1053626666|13;[SELWYN, NEIL; GORARD, STEPHEN; FURLONG, JOHN; MADDEN, LOUISE]|[ur.010274414500.72; ur.013540425157.90; ur.015440007171.58; ur.015432003705.59]|Ageing and Society|2003|23|5|561-582|10.1017/s0144686x03001302|pub.1054868004|404;[Korupp, Sylvia E.; Szydlik, Marc]|[ur.07620562505.86; ur.016243250203.14]|European Sociological Review|2005|21|4|409-422|10.1093/esr/jci030|pub.1059572682|145;[Kvasny, Lynette]|[ur.012613150205.25]|Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|2006|10|2|00-00|10.1111/j.1083-6101.2005.tb00242.x|pub.1061923741|32;[Selwyn, Neil; Gorard, Stephen; Furlong, John]|[ur.010274414500.72; ur.013540425157.90; ur.015440007171.58]|European Journal of Communication|2005|20|1|5-26|10.1177/0267323105049631|pub.1063796540|100;[Haddon, L.G.]|[]|New Media & Society|2000|2|4|387-406|10.1177/14614440022225878|pub.1064003974|13;[Taylor, Shirley; Todd, Peter A.]|[; ]|Information Systems Research|1995|6|2|144-176|10.1287/isre.6.2.144|pub.1064711982|4357;[Davis, Fred D.; Bagozzi, Richard P.; Warshaw, Paul R.]|[ur.014060724401.60; ur.0712073700.63; ur.015250026703.09]|Management Science|1989|35|8|982-1003|10.1287/mnsc.35.8.982|pub.1064720609|12149;[Weick, Karl E.]|[]|Administrative Science Quarterly|1993|38|4|628|10.2307/2393339|pub.1069908660|2987;[Gefen, David; Straub, Detmar]|[ur.010724440512.07; ur.012470601004.22]|Journal of the Association for Information Systems|2000|1|1|1-30|10.17705/1jais.00008|pub.1100702403|860;[Lupton, Ruth]|[]||2003||||10.2307/j.ctt1t899jb|pub.1101926845|62;[Davis, Fred D.]|[]|MIS Quarterly|1989|13|3|319|10.2307/249008|pub.1102514932|25625;[Gefen, David; Straub, Detmar W.]|[ur.010724440512.07; ur.012470601004.22]|MIS Quarterly|1997|21|4|389|10.2307/249720|pub.1102515095|1180;[Venkatesh, Viswanath; Brown, Susan A.]|[; ]|MIS Quarterly|2001|25|1|71|10.2307/3250959|pub.1102515144|731;[Lamb; Kling]|[; ]|MIS Quarterly|2003|27|2|197|10.2307/30036529|pub.1102515228|363;[Gefen; Karahanna; Straub]|[ur.010724440512.07; ; ur.012470601004.22]|MIS Quarterly|2003|27|1|51|10.2307/30036519|pub.1102515265|3812;[Brown; Venkatesh]|[ur.015013030056.05; ur.013441135216.52]|MIS Quarterly|2005|29|3|399|10.2307/25148690|pub.1102515305|731"
pub.1002961745,10.3390/fi3040379,High Quality Geographic Services and Bandwidth Limitations,"In this paper we provide a critical overview of the state of the art in human-centric intelligent data management approaches for geographic visualizations when we are faced with bandwidth limitations. These limitations often force us to rethink how we design displays for geographic visualizations. We need ways to reduce the amount of data to be visualized and transmitted. This is partly because modern instruments effortlessly produce large volumes of data and Web 2.0 further allows bottom-up creation of rich and diverse content. Therefore, the amount of information we have today for creating useful and usable cartographic products is higher than ever before. However, how much of it can we really use online? To answer this question, we first calculate the bandwidth needs for geographic data sets in terms of waiting times. The calculations are based on various data volumes estimated by scholars for different scenarios. Documenting the waiting times clearly demonstrates the magnitude of the problem. Following this, we summarize the current hardware and software solutions, then the current human-centric design approaches trying to address the constraints such as various screen sizes and information overload. We also discuss a limited set of social issues touching upon the digital divide and its implications. We hope that our systematic documentation and critical review will help researchers and practitioners in the field to better understand the current state of the art.",Future Internet,2011,3,4,379-396,"Coltekin, Arzu; Reichenbacher, Tumasch",University of Zurich,Switzerland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002961745,19,"[Selvidge, Paula R.; Chaparro, Barbara S.; Bender, Gregory T.]|[ur.016014525307.06; ur.014531123155.19; ur.010704415107.39]|International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics|2002|29|1|15-20|10.1016/s0169-8141(01)00045-2|pub.1000380315|41;[Hartley, R.

pub.1093693685,10.1109/aero.2007.352938,Multicarrier CDMA for Data Transmission over HF Channels: Application to “Digital Divide” Reduction,"High–Frequency (HF) ionospheric transmission has been employed for many years for long-distance radio bridging both in military and civil applications. In these last decade, the employment of the most advanced transmission techniques to HF channels raised a considerable interest in R&D. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DS/SS) and Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FH/SS) are practical examples of attempts to exploit wideband transmission techniques based on diversity concepts in the low-frequency HF context. In this paper 1 1–4244-0525–4/07/$20.00 ©2007 IEEE. 2 IEEEAC paper #1051, Version 1.6, Updated November 21, 2006 we are proposing the use of multicarrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) techniques for multi-user communications in HF ionospheric channels. The study reported here is related to part of a project aimed at providing cheap and robust wireless connections to isolated rural areas located in central Africa. We analyzed all the problems related to system design and implementation in the context of the considered application environment. A feasible solution has been studied and tested by means of laboratory simulation. Experimental results pointed out the real possibility of exploiting MC-CDMA techniques for high-data rate communications over HF channels due to the robustness and the flexibility inherent to the physical layer technology considered.",2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference,2007,,,1-14,"D'Orazio, Leandro; Sacchi, Claudio; De Natale, Francesco G.B.",University of Trento,Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093693685,3,"[Lemmon, John J.]|[]|Radio Science|2001|36|6|1385-1391|10.1029/2000rs002364|pub.1051507634|5;[D'Orazio, Leandro; Sacchi, Claudio; Granelli, Fabrizio; De Natale, Francesco G.

Here come the needs to find alternative solutions, which can use the ICT (Information & Telecommunications Technology) to meet the access and service needs for PWDs. This article focuses in one hand, on accessible design (or design for all) by using technical standards, adaptive hardware and software, and multi-modality architecture. On the other hand, it discusses the availability due to the lack of an ICT infrastructure in the developing countries, and the affordability as PWDs live in vulnerable situation due to exclusion from education, employment and health care systems. The main aim is to facilitate accessibility of ICTs for all, and how to bring about necessary conditions for PWDs to enjoy the same opportunities in life by creating global awareness on the importance of accessible ICT as means of economic and social integration, to bridge the digital divide and provide equal access to all, and to serve as a medium to exercise fundamental rights. These objectives can be accomplished by using appropriate educational and administrative infrastructure, encouraging the design of ICT equipment production, promoting the development of technologies, encouraging the research on the information society including innovative forms of networking, and by adapting ICT infrastructure, tools, and applications.

pub.1035793709,10.1016/j.giq.2009.10.005,Linking ICTs to rural development: China's rural information policy,"The issue of rural communication development has been conventionally examined under labels such as universal service, digital, divide, broadband deployment, and E-Government, which generally fall into two seemingly distinct categories—access and applications. In China, these concepts are currently incorporated into a single program, if not a single term—“Village Informatization Program” (“VIP”). The VIP upgraded the objectives of previous telephone and television “Village Access Projects” (“VAPs”), an upgrade which is intended to provide “comprehensive information services” in rural areas. The execution of the VIP regime has been faced with challenges. The lack of explicitly defined objectives and institutional arrangement has led to regulatory confusion and has compromised the outcome of initiatives taken by central department and regional/local governments which are more often independent in actions. China is therefore faced with the imperative of formulating the VIP regime which is to assimilate to China's unique institutional context. This article first reviews the current status of the VIP regime before moving on to the discussion of establishing an integrative and sustainable VIP regulatory regime in China. Then, the current regulatory regime is characterized based on which reforms are suggested—in which is highlighted a layer-based localization regulatory solution, which delineates provincial/local roles from central roles based on a stratified incentive policies and governance arrangement. Possible applications in other countries are discussed in the conclusion.",Government Information Quarterly,2010,27,2,187-195,"Xia, Jun",Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,China,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035793709,60,"[Hudson, Heather E.]|[]||2006||||10.4324/9780203933138|pub.1008301167|33;[Helbig, Natalie; Gil-García, J.

Government functions are the most profound areas where ICT can play a pivotal role in fostering and ameliorating citizen centric services. Adaptation of e-Governance is a key for smart governance and making information technology (IT) relevant to ordinary citizens in Bangladesh where a large proportion of the population suffers from digital divide. e-Governance will allow ordinary people to interact with the government at various levels on matters of governance to provide inputs for decision makers. To achieve these desired objectives the journey for establishing e-Governance system in Bangladesh faced challenges that can be summarized by three A's: Access, Awareness and Applications. Being a developing country, it was always a challenge for the country to finance capital intensive endeavours like access backbones and communication infrastructure. Also, newer ICT tools remained beyond the purchasing power of most Bangladeshis. With the proliferation of mobile, while the communication infrastructure challenge is somewhat resolved, the issues of awareness among the public servants and citizen are still low. Such awareness (or lack of it) among middle and senior public officials remained a particular of concern in the context of establishing e-Governance.

pub.1024930104,10.1145/602330.602341,A visualization design repository for mobile devices,"Mobile devices with multimedia and graphics capabilities have great potential in a wide variety of applications. In addition to location-based services, mobile-commerce and multimedia entertainment that are often viewed as promising applications of third generation mobile networks mobile devices also offer a potential solution to bridging the digital divide in developing countries. Mobile devices could be used to provide essential IT services like internet access, communication, information, education and banking in areas where no fully developed infrastructures like the electric grid and wire-based net connections are available. Highly usable interfaces will be a critical factor in the development of successful mobile devices and applications. This is especially true if such IT services should become accessible to illiterate or semi-literate users and users without any previous computer experience where the interface will have to rely largely on graphics and speech as interaction mechanisms. However, the design of multimedia-based interfaces for mobile devices is currently complicated by a lack of standardized visualization techniques and interaction mechanisms and the absence of related component libraries and style guides. As a first step towards the development of a standardized set of device-independent presentation and interaction techniques we are currently working on a repository of visualization design solutions for mobile UIs which will later be extended to include general interaction techniques.","Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on Computer graphics, virtual Reality, visualisation and interaction in Africa  - AFRIGRAPH '03",2003,,,57-62,"Paelke, Volker; Reimann, Christian; Rosenbach, Waldemar",University of Paderborn,Germany,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024930104,21,"[Bederson, Benjamin B.; Meyer, Jon; Good, Lance]|[ur.0617431334.34; ur.015477302313.41; ur.016274662713.25]|Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology  - UIST '00|2000|||171-180|10.1145/354401.354754|pub.1011669591|149;[Rist, Thomas; Brandmeier, Patrick]|[ur.013154104613.04; ur.014066540601.00]|Personal and Ubiquitous Computing|2002|6|4|260-268|10.1007/s007790200026|pub.1028671700|21;[Kawachiya, Kiyokuni; Ishikawa, Hiroshi]|[ur.016451151621.40; ]|Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems - CHI '98|1998|||1-8|10.1145/274644.274645|pub.1039498762|12;[Briscoe, Mary Helen]|[]||1996||||10.1007/978-1-4612-3986-4|pub.1041687018|43;[Mackinlay, Jock]|[ur.014040445526.54]|ACM Transactions on Graphics|1986|5|2|110-141|10.1145/22949.22950|pub.1046624044|1081;[Brewster, Stephen A; Cryer, Peter G]|[ur.010245101071.13; ]|CHI '99 extended abstracts on Human factors in computing systems  - CHI '99|1999|||224-225|10.1145/632716.632855|pub.1047063005|25"
pub.1052697948,10.4018/978-1-60566-026-4.ch169,Designing Web Systems for Adaptive Technology,"For over a decade the term digital divide has been used to refer to discrepancies between various population segments in terms of access to information technologies. The digital divide is in opposition to the ideal of equality of access in which all citizens are afforded uniform access to information and information technology. Discussions on this topic seem to most often focus on such factors as race, income, education, geography, and the like. There is, however, a significant and growing group of “digital have-nots” that is frequently overlooked. This group comprises individuals who have some form of physical, sensory, and or mental disability. While the need for full enfranchisement of this group can be effectively argued on legal as well as ethical grounds, it can be shown to make sound business sense as well. Consider this statistic from the most recent U.S. Census. A startling 21.8% of Americans above the age of 16 have at least one disability that results in a “substantial limitation” of one or more “major life activities.” Examples of such disabilities are vision problems (3.5%), hearing problems (3.3%), difficulty using hands (3.0%), and learning disabilities such as dyslexia (1.4%) (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2000, pp. 62-63). Each of these disabilities carries negative consequences regarding accessibility to Web-based resources. The prevalence of disability increases with age. For example, according to 2005 data, 12.1% of Americans in the age group 16-64 have at least one disability. The percentage jumps to 40.5% when considering those of age 65 and above (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2006, Table S1801). Much of this dramatic increase in occurrence is due to declining vision, hearing, and dexterity (Bergel, Chadwick-Dias, & Tullis, 2005; Fox, 2004; Loiacono, McCoy, & Chin, 2005; Steinmetz, 2006). The youngest American baby boomers are now in their forties. The average age of the population of the U.S. and of most other developed nations will increase substantially over the next few decades, as will the concomitant prevalence of physical disability (Bergel et al., 2005). This demographic shift is due partly to the post World War II “population bubble,” but it is also due to the tremendous increase in life expectancy in modern times (an increase of 30 years since 1900, according to U.S. Administration on Aging statistics) (Mosner & Spiezle, 2003). The segment of the American population comprising individuals of age 50 and above will grow from the current 38% to 47% by the end of the next decade (Moos, 2005). Also growing dramatically is the average age of the workforce. Workers are delaying retirement for numerous reasons, while the rate at which younger workers enter the workforce is declining (Mosner & Spiezle, 2003). In an increasingly Web-oriented information-based economy, worker productivity hinges on accessibility to Web-based systems. This issue demands more attention as the age of the workforce (read prevalence of physiological impairments among workers) increases. This article considers some of the issues surrounding accessibility to Web systems and services by individuals with imperfect abilities. It is argued that, beyond the moral and legal reasons for accommodating this group, there are numerous advantages for business and commerce that can be achieved.","Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, Second Edition",2009,,,1065-1071,"Khosrow-Pour, Mehdi; Westin, Stu",University of Rhode Island,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052697948,0,"[Loiacono, Eleanor; McCoy, Scott]|[ur.014417501213.18; ur.013166067501.28]|Information Technology and People|2004|17|1|87-101|10.1108/09593840410522198|pub.1003612035|29;[Asakawa, Chieko]|[ur.015324164761.16]|Proceedings of the 2005 International Cross-Disciplinary Workshop on Web Accessibility (W4A)  - W4A '05|2005|||1-8|10.1145/1061811.1061813|pub.1020384162|37;[Lazar, Jonathan; Dudley-Sponaugle, Alfreda; Greenidge, Kisha-Dawn]|[ur.013562126001.65; ur.014514264045.45; ur.011201651077.29]|Computers in Human Behavior|2004|20|2|269-288|10.1016/j.chb.2003.10.018|pub.1031890760|156;[Lazar, Jonathan; Greenidge, Kisha-Dawn]|[ur.013562126001.65; ur.011201651077.29]|Universal Access in the Information Society|2006|4|4|285-291|10.1007/s10209-003-0087-1|pub.1036984681|38;[Bergel, Marguerite; Chadwick-Dias, Ann; Tullis, Tom]|[ur.015260266511.45; ur.013665325511.70; ur.010111317171.19]|ACM SIGACCESS Accessibility and Computing|2005||82|18-24|10.1145/1077238.1077241|pub.1050428027|4;[Loiacono, E.T.; McCoy, S.; Chin, W.]|[ur.014417501213.18; ur.013166067501.28; ]|IT Professional|2005|7|1|27-31|10.1109/mitp.2005.1407801|pub.1061406866|17;[Hackett, Stephanie; Parmanto, Bambang; Zeng, Xiaoming]|[ur.016200304555.81; ur.01210244673.54; ur.01372606473.52]|ACM SIGACCESS Accessibility and Computing|2003||77-78|32-39|10.1145/1029014.1028638|pub.1063149215|22"
pub.1041213087,10.1145/1328057.1328104,E-government readiness: from the design table to the grass roots,"e-Government generally refers to the government's use of information technologies (such as LANs, WANs, the Internet, Intranet, and mobile computing) to exchange information and services with citizens, businesses, general public and other arms of government. e-Readiness refers to a country's ability to take advantage of the Internet as an engine of economic growth and human development. In this aspect, several benchmarking indices are available at the macro (also called global) level by the UNPAN, World Bank, EU and others, and e-Readiness indices at the macro level are constructed primarily for ranking countries. These are concerned with the global digital divide, i.e., the gap between countries that have access to ICT and those that do not, mainly because of differences in income, education, culture, etc. are being taken into consideration. However, it has been realized that a micro-level measurable criteria needs to be developed, though they already exists in discrete format, which have been developed by institutions and academics. At micro level, performance measuring tools needs to be developed to dictate appropriate design, planning, implementation, and monitoring criteria so that relevant programmes could really become essential component of society development, and at the same time contribute to human development. It is increasingly clear that for a country to put ICT for effective use, it must be ""e-ready"" in terms of infrastructure, the accessibility of ICT to the population at large, and the effect of the legal and regulatory framework on ICT use. A key indicator of e-readiness is infrastructure and in developing countries this is often a key challenge to the advancement of society. There are many elements to e-readiness such infrastructure, telecommunications, Internet connectivity and skills set as obtained from various sources. At the same time, infrastructure also refers to utilities such as roads, electricity, water and sanitation and these are all relevant components for any ICT4D-social enterprise setting up operations in developing counties. If the digital divide is going to be narrowed, all of these issues must be addressed in a coherent and achievable strategy so that they can be tailored to meet the local needs of particular countries. A good fact is that developing country leaders can use e-readiness assessment to help them measure and plan for ICT integration. It can help them focus their efforts from within, and identify areas where external support or aid is required. But an assessment alone is insufficient, and decision-makers face four key challenges in making effective use of this tool. First, they need to understand how ICT can help their countries achieve economic and social benefits, and set achievable goals accordingly. Second, they must take concrete steps toward effective and sustainable ICT uses that will help their countries realize their objectives. Third, there must be measurable criteria to be developed, so that their implementations can be ranked, and finally, an appropriate data mining solution needs to be established for taking necessary steps in reconciliation, management and future expansion. This paper would like to synthesize various measurable criteria and performance measuring tools in terms of e-Government readiness and at the same time would be performing a few analytical assessments and try to put forward recommendations on successful implementation of e-Government, especially focusing developing countries.",Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Theory and practice of electronic governance - ICEGOV '07,2007,,,225-232,"Rahman, Hakikur",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041213087,13,"[Kovacic, Zlatko J.]|[ur.013634011153.45]|International Journal of Electronic Government Research|2005|1|3|15-32|10.4018/jegr.2005070102|pub.1007605673|15;[Mwangi, Wagaki]|[ur.012642671677.40]|Proceedings of the 2006 national conference on Digital government research  - dg.o '06|2006|||199-208|10.1145/1146598.1146658|pub.1015134072|27;[Ifinedo, Princely; Davidrajuh, Reggie]|[ur.014752325561.70; ur.010051436335.90]|Electronic Government an International Journal|2005|2|2|111|10.1504/eg.2005.007090|pub.1067427476|28;[Huang, Haiyan; Yeo, Benjamin; Trauth, Eileen M.]|[ur.013561515621.93; ur.016235213376.16; ur.07421642022.90]|International Journal of Advanced Media and Communication|2006|1|2|148|10.1504/ijamc.2006.009735|pub.1067431576|4;[Bui, Tung X.; Sankaran, Siva; Sebastian, Ina M.]|[ur.013634430101.87; ur.011443173655.28; ur.07653144235.81]|International Journal of Electronic Business|2003|1|1|3|10.1504/ijeb.2003.002162|pub.1067447048|64"
pub.1045648215,10.1177/0266242606059781,Broadband Divide Among SMEs,"While the digital gap between large and small firms is a fairly well-known phenomenon, this article focuses on the divide within SMEs. Specifically, the aim is to analyse factors that may explain the differences in broadband adoption among SMEs and to explore their significant interrelations. The investigation relies on a two-step procedure: first, using a tree-based technique, relevant variables and interactions are explored; then, through a binomial logistic regression, their impact on broadband diffusion is estimated and tested. Findings confirm that the relative size of the company (a proxy for firm’s internal resources) is still relevant among SMEs; in addition, the geographical area where SMEs are located (environmental resources) can act as a further obstacle especially for the smaller companies of the sample; finally, specific ICT organizational strategies - namely the outsourcing decisions - proved to be an important mitigating factor for size and location-based broadband disadvantages.",International Small Business Journal Researching Entrepreneurship,2006,24,1,83-99,"Arbore, Alessandro; Ordanini, Andrea",Bocconi University,Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045648215,35,"[Loh, Lawrence; Venkatraman, N.]|[ur.014047106453.27; ur.014276136305.51]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1992|9|1|7-24|10.1080/07421222.1992.11517945|pub.1010461513|428;[Freel, Mark S.]|[ur.013274103653.09]|International Small Business Journal Researching Entrepreneurship|2000|18|2|60-80|10.1177/0266242600182003|pub.1020040769|204;[Mehrtens, Jenni; Cragg, Paul B.; Mills, Annette M.]|[; ur.014144016142.56; ur.016403243033.82]|Information & Management|2001|39|3|165-176|10.1016/s0378-7206(01)00086-6|pub.1024959310|408;[Haughton, Domlnlque; Oulabi, Samer]|[; ur.011777225046.31]|Journal of Interactive Marketing|1993|7|3|16-26|10.1002/dir.4000070305|pub.1026191520|26;[Ricci, Andrea]|[]|Telematics and Informatics|2000|17|1-2|141-167|10.1016/s0736-5853(00)00002-2|pub.1031906557|39;[Dandridge, Tom; Levenburg, Nancy M.]|[; ur.015154720533.89]|International Small Business Journal Researching Entrepreneurship|2000|18|2|81-91|10.1177/0266242600182004|pub.1033803171|46;[Riemenschneider, Cynthia K.; Harrison, David A.; Mykytyn, Peter P.]|[ur.07462365171.21; ur.01175275535.42; ur.015643744302.87]|Information & Management|2003|40|4|269-285|10.1016/s0378-7206(02)00010-1|pub.1035903226|309;[Levy, Margi; Powell, Philip]|[ur.015526566203.58; ur.015510442771.15]|Small Business Economics|1998|11|2|183-196|10.1023/a:1007912714741|pub.1038371225|121;[Yang, Chyan; Huang, Jen-Bor]|[ur.01126632313.54; ]|International Journal of Information Management|2000|20|3|225-239|10.1016/s0268-4012(00)00007-4|pub.1039377974|136;[Grubesic, Tony H.; Murray, Alan T.]|[ur.01102232364.97; ur.011335074125.33]|Papers of the Regional Science Association|2002|81|2|197-221|10.1007/s101100100096|pub.1041955449|89;[Thong, J.Y.L.; Yap, C.S.]|[ur.010227735415.39; ur.015760736627.36]|Omega|1995|23|4|429-442|10.1016/0305-0483(95)00017-i|pub.1043414262|408;[Prieger, James E.]|[ur.014605206564.75]|Economic Inquiry|2003|41|2|346-363|10.1093/ei/cbg013|pub.1046360997|137;[Corrocher, Nicoletta; Ordanini, Andrea]|[ur.011256716263.36; ur.015022300133.21]|Journal of Information Technology|2002|17|1|9-19|10.1080/02683960210132061|pub.1058311977|116;[Daniel, Elizabeth M.; Grimshaw, David J.]|[ur.015535626251.48; ur.011456614523.78]|Journal of Information Technology|2002|17|3|133-147|10.1080/0268396022000018409|pub.1058311997|113;[Sawyer, Steve; Allen, J.

We try to offer real examples for the development of digital literacy in a variety of areas of application: education, social inclusion and firms. For that reason we describe and analyze the contribution of digital literacy to the following Spanish projects: Educared, which promotes the spread of Internet for innovation and pedagogical training amongst teachers, parents and students in primary and secondary schools; the Dana Project, which identifies good practices to reduce the digital gap based in gender; and Competic, a program offers good practices for the promotion of information and communication technologies in small and medium size firms.",International Journal of Digital Literacy and Digital Competence,2010,1,1,61-76,"Heredero, C.

pub.1150200323,10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199233748.001.0001.002.004,List of Abbreviations,"Abstract China's telecommunications industry has seen revolutionary transformation and growth over the past three decades. Chinese Internet users number more than 150 million, and the PRC expects to quickly pass the US in total numbers of connected citizens. The number of mobile and fixed-line telephone users soared from a mere 2 million in 1980 to a total of more than 800 million in 2007 — the country took the number one rank in the world in the number of telephones. China has been the most successful developing nation in history for spreading telecommunications access at an unparalleled rapid pace. This book tells how China conducted its remarkable ‘telecommunications revolution’. It examines both corporate and government policy to get citizens connected to both voice and data networks. It looks at the potential challenges to the one-party government when citizens get this access. And it considers the new opportunities for networking now offered the people of one of the world's fastest growing economies. The book is based on the author's fieldwork conducted in several Chinese cities, as well as extensive archival research. It focuses on key issues such as building and running the country's Internet, mobile phone company rivalry, foreign investment in the sector, and telecommunications in China's vibrant city of Shanghai. It also considers the country's internal ‘digital divide’, and questions how equitable the telecommunications revolution has been. Finally, it examines the ways the PRC's entry to the World Trade Organization will shape the future course of telecommunications growth.",China's Telecommunications Revolution,2008,,,xv-xvii,"Harwit, Eric",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150200323,0,"[]|[]|Learning from the Asian Tigers, Studies in Technology and Industrial Policy|1996||||10.1057/9780230389892|pub.1002410939|197;[Hardy, Andrew P.]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1980|4|4|278-286|10.1016/0308-5961(80)90044-0|pub.1003695597|271;[Tan, Zixiang Alex]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|2002|26|1-2|17-30|10.1016/s0308-5961(01)00051-9|pub.1004940876|34;[Low, Brian]|[ur.011125544305.44]|Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing|2005|20|2|99-108|10.1108/08858620510583696|pub.1010542820|23;[Miozzo, Marcela]|[]|Development and Change|2000|31|3|651-680|10.1111/1467-7660.00171|pub.1011191090|41;[Chan, Joseph Man]|[ur.014114471555.64]|Journal of Communication|1994|44|3|70-88|10.1111/j.1460-2466.1994.tb00689.x|pub.1012885172|50;[Roseman, Daniel]|[]|Info|2005|7|2|25-48|10.1108/14636690510587207|pub.1014073198|28;[Oi, Jean C.]|[ur.015635567625.29]|World Politics|1992|45|1|99-126|10.2307/2010520|pub.1014358002|742;[Shen, Xiaobai]|[]||1999||||10.1057/9781403905505|pub.1016656556|49;[Harwit, Eric; Clark, Duncan]|[; ]|Asian Survey|2001|41|3|377-408|10.1525/as.2001.41.3.377|pub.1016682559|126;[Graham, Stephen]|[ur.07400157061.00]|Urban Studies|1999|36|5-6|929-949|10.1080/0042098993286|pub.1019539907|128;[Graham, Stephen]|[]|European Planning Studies|1995|3|3|357-380|10.1080/09654319508720311|pub.1019699760|19;[Taubman, Geoffry]|[ur.013537475423.33]|Political Communication|1998|15|2|255-272|10.1080/10584609809342369|pub.1025475558|74;[Falch, Morten; Anyimadu, Amos]|[ur.013275464145.07; ur.013660367715.22]|Telecommunications Policy|2003|27|1-2|21-39|10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00092-7|pub.1025724859|31;[Coates, Ken; Holroyd, Carin]|[ur.016060567165.18; ur.014066341307.19]||2003||||10.1057/9781403990075|pub.1026672802|29;[Zhang, Bing]|[]|Telematics and Informatics|2002|19|4|331-349|10.1016/s0736-5853(01)00022-3|pub.1027906615|30;[Tan, Zixiang]|[ur.013340022455.08]|Telecommunications Policy|1995|19|9|721-731|10.1016/0308-5961(95)00036-4|pub.1031806234|25;[Wu, Wei]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1996|20|9|699-711|10.1016/s0308-5961(96)00050-x|pub.1034932818|33;[Zixiang, Tan]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1999|23|3-4|261-276|10.1016/s0308-5961(99)00007-5|pub.1036102052|42;[Walcott, Susan M.; Wheeler, James O.]|[ur.011537053213.48; ur.010034174305.23]|Urban Geography|2001|22|4|316-339|10.2747/0272-3638.22.4.316|pub.1038378526|34;[Anchordoguy, Marie]|[ur.013360745147.75]|The Business History Review|2001|75|3|507-541|10.2307/3116385|pub.1041836681|30;[Yang, Guobin]|[]|The China Quarterly|2005|181||46-66|10.1017/s0305741005000032|pub.1054082379|269;[Pack, H.]|[]|The World Bank Research Observer|2006|21|2|267-297|10.1093/wbro/lkl001|pub.1060065614|226;[Hackler, Darrene]|[ur.013360441435.37]|American Behavioral Scientist|2003|46|8|1034-1055|10.1177/0002764202250493|pub.1063544756|29;[SEGAL, ADAM; THUN, ERIC]|[; ]|Politics & Society|2001|29|4|557-588|10.1177/0032329201029004004|pub.1063655225|56;[Hackler, Darrene]|[ur.013360441435.37]|Urban Affairs Review|2003|39|1|59-86|10.1177/1078087403253054|pub.1063965288|24;[Röller, Lars-Hendrik; Waverman, Leonard]|[ur.015270256445.92; ur.015703454717.79]|American Economic Review|2001|91|4|909-923|10.1257/aer.91.4.909|pub.1064527330|927;[Harwit, Eric]|[]|Pacific Affairs|1998|71|2|175|10.2307/2760975|pub.1070089402|29;[Godement, François]|[]||1999||||10.4324/9780203258668|pub.1095908120|33;[]|[]|Who was Who in the People's Republic of China|1997||||10.1515/9783110968231|pub.1096968032|13;[Steinfeld, Edward S.]|[]||1998||||10.1017/cbo9780511625831|pub.1098666478|238;[Gilboy, George J.]|[ur.07601232711.96]|FOREIGN AFFAIRS|2004|83|4|33|10.2307/20034045|pub.1102751739|109;[Krugman, Paul]|[ur.014547664317.69]|FOREIGN AFFAIRS|1994|73|6|62|10.2307/20046929|pub.1102759649|1303"
pub.1050438231,10.1145/1456659.1456677,An investigation into the implementation of open source software within the SA government: an emerging expansion model,"Open source software (OSS) is increasingly becoming an alternative for proprietary software (PS), particularly in the government sector globally. The adoption and implementation of OSS by the government sector is cited as one of the enablers for the adoption of OSS by the private sector. It is also apparent that in the government sector internationally, OSS is seen as a viable technology for reasons such as lowering software costs, growing local software development industry, and bridging the digital divide. In South Africa (SA), an OSS policy that mandates OSS usage within ministries is in place. But according to various open source advocates, little has happened with regards to OSS implementation in the SA government. This paper reports on the current status of OSS usage within the SA government by surveying forty (40) national departments, targeting Information Technology (IT) directors and managers. The results indicate that OSS usage within the ministries is not yet extensive as required by the OSS policy. Various challenges and obstacles are hampering full OSS implementation within the ministries. The contribution of this research paper is an OSS expansion model, which is proposed as a possible solution to improve the current status of OSS usage within the SA government departments. The model proposed is in line with SA government's implementation strategy as outlined in the OSS policy.",Proceedings of the 2008 annual research conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists on IT research in developing countries riding the wave of technology - SAICSIT '08,2008,,,148-158,"Mtsweni, Jabu; Biermann, Elmarie",Tshwane University of Technology,South Africa,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050438231,8,"[Johnson-Eilola, Johndan]|[ur.014327357711.87]|Proceedings of the 20th annual international conference on Computer documentation  - SIGDOC '02|2002|||79-83|10.1145/584955.584967|pub.1028392871|4;[Waring, Teresa; Maddocks, Philip]|[ur.011055335521.84; ]|International Journal of Information Management|2005|25|5|411-428|10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2005.06.002|pub.1044429417|55;[Hoepman, Jaap-Henk; Jacobs, Bart]|[ur.011671002215.25; ur.012120550540.40]|Communications of the ACM|2007|50|1|79-83|10.1145/1188913.1188921|pub.1046862735|65"

It aims to profile a new engagement technique called “embedded outreach” and seeks to discuss the impact this technique has on tackling digital exclusion.   Design/methodology/approach Data was gathered via a baseline survey at the beginning of the sessions to measure 895 attendees' existing web use and attitudes to the internet. A follow‐up survey of 295 older people two months later captured any change in use and attitude as a result of the sessions. A secondary follow‐up survey measured the legacy of the sessions.   Findings The embedded outreach model was effective in breaking through many of the multiple barriers which prevent older people from using the web. Data showed that using existing voluntary sector infrastructure was key to reaching people.   Research limitations/implications Owing to timescales, only one session was delivered to each group. If the project had been carried out over a longer duration then repeat sessions could have been delivered to the groups and results measured.   Originality/value A wide range of schemes support older people to get online yet most rely on “pull” techniques – where participants have to seek out opportunities. There has been little research into techniques that use existing voluntary sector infrastructure to bring the web to older people.",Working with Older People,2011,15,3,127-134,"Agnew, Ian; Ripper, Laura",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046035187,0,

Developed using an end-to-end architecture, the Internet places the intelligence at the network's edges, allowing users to define what applications and services to run and which hardware and devices to use. However, the democratic potential of the Internet is being threatened by structural changes that, if left unchecked, will limit future innovation and participation. If these trends continue, the Internet will devolve into a feudalized space—one that limits democratic freedoms while enriching an oligopoly of powerful gatekeepers. While incumbent phone, cable, and software companies stand to gain financially from these enclosures, as this chapter documents, the negative outcomes stemming from this digital feudalization will have profound detrimental impacts on democratic and affordable communications. This chapter highlights specific policy debates, both within United States and internationally, that undergird these vulnerabilities, and illuminates normative understandings about the role of the Internet in supporting a democratic, civil society. Using the seven-layer OSI model as a framework, our analysis catalogs current threats to this telecommunications commons and examines the policy provisions that should be implemented to prevent the feudalization of the Internet.",Advances in Computers,2011,81,,237-287,"Meinrath, Sascha D.; Losey, James W.; Pickard, Victor W.",New America; New York University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1012025648,23,"[Habermas, Jürgen]|[]|Communication Theory|2006|16|4|411-426|10.1111/j.1468-2885.2006.00280.x|pub.1012148607|902;[Santivanez, C.; Ramanathan, R.; Partridge, C.; Krishnan, R.; Condell, M.; Polit, S.]|[ur.014625550315.74; ur.07732145557.50; ur.013422206143.49; ur.011044427045.50; ur.012621731645.37; ur.016635671245.70]|Proceedings of the 2nd annual international workshop on Wireless internet  - WICON '06|2006|||13|10.1145/1234161.1234174|pub.1019795147|43;[Cammaerts, Bart]|[ur.016522520221.19]|Communication Culture and Critique|2008|1|4|358-377|10.1111/j.1753-9137.2008.00028.x|pub.1021065562|92;[Odlyzko, Andrew]|[ur.014633006644.13]|Review of Network Economics|2009|8|1||10.2202/1446-9022.1169|pub.1026631121|66;[Pickard, Victor W.]|[ur.011705260474.52]|New Media & Society|2008|10|4|625-645|10.1177/1461444808093734|pub.1030658206|37;[Goldsmith, Jack]|[]|Strategic Direction|2007|23|11||10.1108/sd.2007.05623kae.001|pub.1061075683|118;[]|[]|Choice|1999|37|01|37-0115-37-0115|10.5860/choice.37-0115|pub.1073359654|59;[]|[]|Choice|2002|40|01|40-0535-40-0535|10.5860/choice.40-0535|pub.1073382108|229;[]|[]|Choice|2002|40|02|40-1036-40-1036|10.5860/choice.40-1036|pub.1073382614|18;[]|[]|Choice|2004|42|03|42-1641-42-1641|10.5860/choice.42-1641|pub.1073398134|226;[]|[]|Choice|2006|44|02|44-0999-44-0999|10.5860/choice.44-0999|pub.1073412697|1309;[]|[]|Choice|2011|48|05|48-2725-48-2725|10.5860/choice.48-2725|pub.1073443294|12;[]|[]|Choice|2011|48|08|48-4604-48-4604|10.5860/choice.48-4604|pub.1073445184|31;[]|[]|Protocol Politics|2009||||10.7551/mitpress/9780262042574.001.0001|pub.1099503988|136;[Kahin, Brian; Keller, James H.]|[]|Coordinating the Internet|1997||||10.7551/mitpress/2170.001.0001|pub.1110616839|21"
pub.1007087277,10.1108/14636691111101847,Economic sustainability of international telecommunication networks,"Purpose  The paper aims to examine the expanding broadband “digital divide” as a warning that developing countries are falling behind in the upgrade of their telecommunication networks, specially the access network. It points out the deteriorated financial conditions facing developing countries in the context of the global economic crisis that adversely affects the availability of resources to invest in network infrastructure.    Design/methodology/approach  The paper is based on a review and analysis of relevant literature and the outcomes of significant ICT for development events.    Findings  The existing economic mechanisms in international communications networks establish the financial flows in favor of the developed countries, thus thwarting any attempt to increase its net external income that could be used in investments in telecommunications infrastructure. On the other hand, convergence and the migration to next generation networks present a new set of opportunities and challenges to establish an international interconnection regime that will allow the developing countries to recover the investment in infrastructure.    Research limitations/implications  The scarcity of publicly available economic data of the current international interconnection agreements suggests the necessity to conduct further research in this area.    Practical implications  The failure to establish a non‐discriminatory international interconnection regime could lead to economic unsustainability of international networks in the long run. The paper presents some recommendations to address this issue.    Originality/value  This paper presents an approximation to an important issue of international telecommunication networks that is usually hidden behind the confidentiality of services contracts.",Info,2011,13,1,6-12,"González, Juan Alfonso Fernández",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007087277,0,"[Yoon, Kiho]|[ur.012176616727.93]|Review of Network Economics|2006|5|3||10.2202/1446-9022.1102|pub.1005588893|12;[Weiss, Martin B.; Shin, Seung Jae]|[ur.011170146137.35; ]|NETNOMICS: Economic Research and Electronic Networking|2004|6|1|43-57|10.1023/b:netn.0000023380.38300.25|pub.1034568418|37;[Davoyan, Ruzana; Altmann, Jörn; Effelsberg, Wolfgang]|[ur.013540456075.26; ur.016120527445.58; ur.014002605047.55]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2009|5539||85-96|10.1007/978-3-642-01796-4_9|pub.1038494940|4;[D'Ignazio, Alessio; Giovannetti, Emanuele]|[ur.011276175237.51; ur.016660431737.26]|International Journal of Industrial Organization|2009|27|3|441-448|10.1016/j.ijindorg.2008.11.004|pub.1039499674|13;[Beltran, Fernando]|[ur.010714655225.44]|SSRN Electronic Journal|2003||||10.2139/ssrn.584841|pub.1102205216|1;[Kunigami, Arturo; Navas-Sabater, Juan]|[; ur.011243456530.25]|World Bank Working Papers|2009||||10.1596/978-0-8213-8140-3|pub.1109376317|10;[Estache, Antonio; Manacorda, Marco; Valletti, Tommaso M.]|[ur.010747753747.88; ur.011660711507.79; ur.015327522513.89]|Policy Research Working Papers|2002||||10.1596/1813-9450-2802|pub.1109731722|11"
pub.1022672949,10.4018/978-1-59140-815-4.ch098,Gender Inclusion in the Information Society,"Strategies of Inclusion Gender and the Information Society (SIGIS) was a European study exploring initiatives to include more women in the information society.1 This article summarises its main conclusions. The work started from the premise that overall more women than men are excluded from the information society, both as users and as designers of new information and communications technologies (ICTs). Our literature review (Sørensen & Stewart, 2002) confirmed that there is still a gender gap in terms of ownership of some ICT products and, to a lesser extent, in terms of access and use. Gender cuts across other dynamics in the digital divide—income, occupation and age being generally more significant than gender—with other factors (e.g., ethnic minorities, lone parent families) also intervening. Although the trend with respect to the use of ICT products is one of a closing gender gap, it is clear that diffusion alone is not sufficient to close the gap all together; inclusion efforts are still warranted in this area. By contrast, the literature review revealed a persistent and sizeable gender gap within computer specialisms and professions designing ICTs. The proportion of women entering computer science and engineering courses in most countries is static or in decline, in spite of sustained inclusion efforts. So, the overall picture across Europe is a contradictory one: optimistic with respect to what we call women and ICT (users), and pessimistic with respect to women in ICT (professionals).",Encyclopedia of Gender and Information Technology,2006,,,636-642,"Trauth, Eileen M.; Faulkner, Wendy; Lie, Merete",University of Edinburgh,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022672949,1,
pub.1150200325,10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199233748.002.0005,Preface,"Abstract China's telecommunications industry has seen revolutionary transformation and growth over the past three decades. Chinese Internet users number more than 150 million, and the PRC expects to quickly pass the US in total numbers of connected citizens. The number of mobile and fixed-line telephone users soared from a mere 2 million in 1980 to a total of more than 800 million in 2007 — the country took the number one rank in the world in the number of telephones. China has been the most successful developing nation in history for spreading telecommunications access at an unparalleled rapid pace. This book tells how China conducted its remarkable ‘telecommunications revolution’. It examines both corporate and government policy to get citizens connected to both voice and data networks. It looks at the potential challenges to the one-party government when citizens get this access. And it considers the new opportunities for networking now offered the people of one of the world's fastest growing economies. The book is based on the author's fieldwork conducted in several Chinese cities, as well as extensive archival research. It focuses on key issues such as building and running the country's Internet, mobile phone company rivalry, foreign investment in the sector, and telecommunications in China's vibrant city of Shanghai. It also considers the country's internal ‘digital divide’, and questions how equitable the telecommunications revolution has been. Finally, it examines the ways the PRC's entry to the World Trade Organization will shape the future course of telecommunications growth.",China's Telecommunications Revolution,2008,,,vii-vii,"Harwit, Eric",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150200325,0,"[]|[]|Learning from the Asian Tigers, Studies in Technology and Industrial Policy|1996||||10.1057/9780230389892|pub.1002410939|197;[Hardy, Andrew P.]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1980|4|4|278-286|10.1016/0308-5961(80)90044-0|pub.1003695597|271;[Tan, Zixiang Alex]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|2002|26|1-2|17-30|10.1016/s0308-5961(01)00051-9|pub.1004940876|34;[Low, Brian]|[ur.011125544305.44]|Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing|2005|20|2|99-108|10.1108/08858620510583696|pub.1010542820|23;[Miozzo, Marcela]|[]|Development and Change|2000|31|3|651-680|10.1111/1467-7660.00171|pub.1011191090|41;[Chan, Joseph Man]|[ur.014114471555.64]|Journal of Communication|1994|44|3|70-88|10.1111/j.1460-2466.1994.tb00689.x|pub.1012885172|50;[Roseman, Daniel]|[]|Info|2005|7|2|25-48|10.1108/14636690510587207|pub.1014073198|28;[Oi, Jean C.]|[ur.015635567625.29]|World Politics|1992|45|1|99-126|10.2307/2010520|pub.1014358002|742;[Shen, Xiaobai]|[]||1999||||10.1057/9781403905505|pub.1016656556|49;[Harwit, Eric; Clark, Duncan]|[; ]|Asian Survey|2001|41|3|377-408|10.1525/as.2001.41.3.377|pub.1016682559|126;[Graham, Stephen]|[ur.07400157061.00]|Urban Studies|1999|36|5-6|929-949|10.1080/0042098993286|pub.1019539907|128;[Graham, Stephen]|[]|European Planning Studies|1995|3|3|357-380|10.1080/09654319508720311|pub.1019699760|19;[Taubman, Geoffry]|[ur.013537475423.33]|Political Communication|1998|15|2|255-272|10.1080/10584609809342369|pub.1025475558|74;[Falch, Morten; Anyimadu, Amos]|[ur.013275464145.07; ur.013660367715.22]|Telecommunications Policy|2003|27|1-2|21-39|10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00092-7|pub.1025724859|31;[Coates, Ken; Holroyd, Carin]|[ur.016060567165.18; ur.014066341307.19]||2003||||10.1057/9781403990075|pub.1026672802|29;[Zhang, Bing]|[]|Telematics and Informatics|2002|19|4|331-349|10.1016/s0736-5853(01)00022-3|pub.1027906615|30;[Tan, Zixiang]|[ur.013340022455.08]|Telecommunications Policy|1995|19|9|721-731|10.1016/0308-5961(95)00036-4|pub.1031806234|25;[Wu, Wei]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1996|20|9|699-711|10.1016/s0308-5961(96)00050-x|pub.1034932818|33;[Zixiang, Tan]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1999|23|3-4|261-276|10.1016/s0308-5961(99)00007-5|pub.1036102052|42;[Walcott, Susan M.; Wheeler, James O.]|[ur.011537053213.48; ur.010034174305.23]|Urban Geography|2001|22|4|316-339|10.2747/0272-3638.22.4.316|pub.1038378526|34;[Anchordoguy, Marie]|[ur.013360745147.75]|The Business History Review|2001|75|3|507-541|10.2307/3116385|pub.1041836681|30;[Yang, Guobin]|[]|The China Quarterly|2005|181||46-66|10.1017/s0305741005000032|pub.1054082379|269;[Pack, H.]|[]|The World Bank Research Observer|2006|21|2|267-297|10.1093/wbro/lkl001|pub.1060065614|226;[Hackler, Darrene]|[ur.013360441435.37]|American Behavioral Scientist|2003|46|8|1034-1055|10.1177/0002764202250493|pub.1063544756|29;[SEGAL, ADAM; THUN, ERIC]|[; ]|Politics & Society|2001|29|4|557-588|10.1177/0032329201029004004|pub.1063655225|56;[Hackler, Darrene]|[ur.013360441435.37]|Urban Affairs Review|2003|39|1|59-86|10.1177/1078087403253054|pub.1063965288|24;[Röller, Lars-Hendrik; Waverman, Leonard]|[ur.015270256445.92; ur.015703454717.79]|American Economic Review|2001|91|4|909-923|10.1257/aer.91.4.909|pub.1064527330|927;[Harwit, Eric]|[]|Pacific Affairs|1998|71|2|175|10.2307/2760975|pub.1070089402|29;[Godement, François]|[]||1999||||10.4324/9780203258668|pub.1095908120|33;[]|[]|Who was Who in the People's Republic of China|1997||||10.1515/9783110968231|pub.1096968032|13;[Steinfeld, Edward S.]|[]||1998||||10.1017/cbo9780511625831|pub.1098666478|238;[Gilboy, George J.]|[ur.07601232711.96]|FOREIGN AFFAIRS|2004|83|4|33|10.2307/20034045|pub.1102751739|109;[Krugman, Paul]|[ur.014547664317.69]|FOREIGN AFFAIRS|1994|73|6|62|10.2307/20046929|pub.1102759649|1303"
pub.1061629687,10.1109/tifs.2009.2034903,"Development, Formal Verification, and Evaluation of an E-Voting System with VVPAT","The use of new technologies to support voting has been and is the subject of great debate. Several people advocate the benefits it can bring—such as improved speed and accuracy in counting, accessibility, voting from home—and as many are concerned with the risks it poses, such as unequal access (digital divide), violation to secrecy and anonymity, alteration of the results of an election (because of malicious attacks, bad design/coding, or procedural weaknesses). The attitude of different governments towards electronic voting (e-voting) varies accordingly. In this paper, we present the activities related to the development and formal verification of an e-voting system, called ProVotE. ProVotE is an end-to-end e-voting system with a voter verified paper audit trial, developed within the framework of a larger initiative whose goal is assessing the feasibility of introducing e-voting in the Autonomous Province of Trento. ProVotE has been used in trials and elections with legal value in Italy. What we believe to be of interest is the approach we took for its development, which has been based on a participatory design for the definition of the voter interface, on the usage of formal methods and model checking for the validation of the core logic of the machine, on open source components, and on the formal analysis of some critical procedures related to the usage of the machine during the election.",IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2009,4,4,651-661,"Villafiorita, Adolfo; Weldemariam, Komminist; Tiella, Roberto",University of Trento,Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1061629687,33,"[Tiella, Roberto; Villafiorita, Adolfo; Tomasi, Silvia]|[ur.014127020733.38; ur.013061335520.14; ]|Proceedings of the 5th international symposium on Principles and practice of programming in Java  - PPPJ '07|2007|||93-102|10.1145/1294325.1294338|pub.1000383603|16;[Weldemariam, Komminist; Villafiorita, Adolfo; Mattioli, Andrea]|[ur.014534273573.63; ur.013061335520.14; ur.016622622735.66]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2007|4896||38-49|10.1007/978-3-540-77493-8_4|pub.1003893672|11;[Kremer, Steve; Ryan, Mark]|[ur.015573446363.24; ur.015644727164.29]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2005|3444||186-200|10.1007/978-3-540-31987-0_14|pub.1005561231|130;[Jones, Douglas W.]|[]|Advances in Information Security|2003|7||3-16|10.1007/978-1-4615-0239-5_1|pub.1007162902|11;[Balzarotti, Davide; Banks, Greg; Cova, Marco; Felmetsger, Viktoria; Kemmerer, Richard; Robertson, William; Valeur, Fredrik; Vigna, Giovanni]|[ur.011132421016.30; ur.014420203771.44; ur.012676671221.28; ur.013346725517.80; ur.010060003062.81; ur.01310241642.05; ur.012007177523.17; ur.016705742015.59]|Proceedings of the 2008 international symposium on Software testing and analysis - ISSTA '08|2008|||237-248|10.1145/1390630.1390660|pub.1010381194|19;[Cimatti, Alessandro; Clarke, Edmund; Giunchiglia, Enrico; Giunchiglia, Fausto; Pistore, Marco; Roveri, Marco; Sebastiani, Roberto; Tacchella, Armando]|[ur.013301517470.46; ur.01012711760.30; ur.07551035027.29; ur.012220127537.38; ur.010057104375.88; ur.010503036505.52; ur.015333466277.73; ur.012770113005.13]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2002|2404||359-364|10.1007/3-540-45657-0_29|pub.1011999163|1010;[Mercuri, Rebecca T.; Camp, L.

pub.1049049286,10.4018/jictrda.2010070103,Emerging Information and Communication Technology Policy Framework for Africa,"While emerging information and communications technologies (ICTs) offer possible solutions to some of the problems of applying ICTs in Africa, there are many challenges that have to be addressed in order to create an environment that is conducive for harnessing these technologies. This chapter, therefore, reviews emerging ICTs and their potential for application in leveraging Africa’s efforts towards meeting its development efforts. The Chapter highlights the digital divide barriers that may inhibit emergent ICTs in Africa. A review of current ICT policies of selected African countries indicates that the policies are geared towards application of ICTs other than their production. The review also reveals a lack of appreciation for emerging ICTs in Africa, both at the national as well as the sub-regional economic bloc levels. The chapter proposes policy frameworks for emerging ICTs for Africa that are necessary for creating an enabling environment for harnessing the emerging ICTs that will propel the continent into the 21st Century and beyond. The barriers to ICTs cut across many different issues. As such, they require multi-pronged policy approaches to address them. And that an emerging ICT environment must be anchored on a number of strategic policy frameworks including the legal, regulatory/administrative institutional framework, infrastructure, technology advocacy, financial, human resources, education and research frameworks. It concludes that Africa can prepare for its future by creating an appropriate environment for fostering the adoption and application of emerging technologies.",International Journal of ICT Research and Development in Africa,2010,1,3,46-64,"Zulu, Saul F.C.",University of Botswana,Botswana,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049049286,1,"[ZULU, SAUL F.

As he matured into an extraordinarily tall, thin man with a hugely wide smile, he became a computer consultant. However, from early on, he was one of the few in his generation who noticed – with concern – that the young people growing up in the favelas on the hills overlooking his middle-class neighborhood had no access to this digital world. Because he has the great entrepreneur's tenacity of observation and thought as well as action, he decided he had to take on the digital divide – well before the phrase came into currency – and he has been pursuing this vision relentlessly ever since. While beginning to work toward this dream as a teenager, he learned just how motivated and capable of learning the young people in the favelas were. And also how competent the favela community was in organizing. This respect underlies the central insight that has allowed Rodrigo to have a growing multi-continental impact. Rodrigo provides only what the community cannot: typically computers, software, and training. The community does the organizing, finding space, recruiting the students and faculty, and providing ongoing administration. The result is a uniquely economical model, and also one where, because the investment strengthens the broader community, it is self-sustaining and a foundation for other initiatives long into the future.

These phenomena are aided and propelled by a new “network intelligence” consummated in the introduction of information and communication technology (ICT). The world has also witnessed a reinvention of the whole process of governance that has impacted society in various ways. Through the Internet and digital connectivity, today’s world has come to be closer than ever before. Efficiency and processes of governance have been improved through faster information flow in the governance chain. Bottlenecks and cost of labor have been reduced across the world. Furthermore, ICT has opened new possibilities, improved transparency and access to information as well as partnership and collaboration, leading to improved relationships between the citizen and state. While Europe and North America, as well as some countries of Asia and the pacific, have taken advantage of this development to improve their economies and governance process, Ningo (1999) observes that sub-Saharan Africa has remained either passive or in the periphery, often reduced to a consumer for reasons related to its history or its system of governance—or lack of one.

Since the adoption of the BPoA in 2001, LDCs have made inroads in establishing an enabling regulatory environment that fosters competition, network investment and the provision of telecommunication services to a larger portion of their populations. The rapid adoption of mobile cellular technology in these countries has helped narrow the digital gap with developing and developed countries. However, the minimal progress achieved in the deployment of fixed and mobile broadband signals the need to implement more effective strategies to bring technology and international Internet bandwidth costs down, so that by improving affordability, service uptake is able to rise in these countries.",,2011,,,,ITU,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107207017,0,

Chinese Internet users number more than 150 million, and the PRC expects to quickly pass the US in total numbers of connected citizens. The number of mobile and fixed-line telephone users soared from a mere 2 million in 1980 to a total of more than 800 million in 2007 — the country took the number one rank in the world in the number of telephones. China has been the most successful developing nation in history for spreading telecommunications access at an unparalleled rapid pace. This book tells how China conducted its remarkable ‘telecommunications revolution’. It examines both corporate and government policy to get citizens connected to both voice and data networks. It looks at the potential challenges to the one-party government when citizens get this access. And it considers the new opportunities for networking now offered the people of one of the world's fastest growing economies. The book is based on the author's fieldwork conducted in several Chinese cities, as well as extensive archival research. It focuses on key issues such as building and running the country's Internet, mobile phone company rivalry, foreign investment in the sector, and telecommunications in China's vibrant city of Shanghai. It also considers the country's internal ‘digital divide’, and questions how equitable the telecommunications revolution has been. Finally, it examines the ways the PRC's entry to the World Trade Organization will shape the future course of telecommunications growth.",China's Telecommunications Revolution,2008,,,xiii-xiv,"Harwit, Eric",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150200322,0,"[]|[]|Learning from the Asian Tigers, Studies in Technology and Industrial Policy|1996||||10.1057/9780230389892|pub.1002410939|197;[Hardy, Andrew P.]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1980|4|4|278-286|10.1016/0308-5961(80)90044-0|pub.1003695597|271;[Tan, Zixiang Alex]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|2002|26|1-2|17-30|10.1016/s0308-5961(01)00051-9|pub.1004940876|34;[Low, Brian]|[ur.011125544305.44]|Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing|2005|20|2|99-108|10.1108/08858620510583696|pub.1010542820|23;[Miozzo, Marcela]|[]|Development and Change|2000|31|3|651-680|10.1111/1467-7660.00171|pub.1011191090|41;[Chan, Joseph Man]|[ur.014114471555.64]|Journal of Communication|1994|44|3|70-88|10.1111/j.1460-2466.1994.tb00689.x|pub.1012885172|50;[Roseman, Daniel]|[]|Info|2005|7|2|25-48|10.1108/14636690510587207|pub.1014073198|28;[Oi, Jean C.]|[ur.015635567625.29]|World Politics|1992|45|1|99-126|10.2307/2010520|pub.1014358002|742;[Shen, Xiaobai]|[]||1999||||10.1057/9781403905505|pub.1016656556|49;[Harwit, Eric; Clark, Duncan]|[; ]|Asian Survey|2001|41|3|377-408|10.1525/as.2001.41.3.377|pub.1016682559|126;[Graham, Stephen]|[ur.07400157061.00]|Urban Studies|1999|36|5-6|929-949|10.1080/0042098993286|pub.1019539907|128;[Graham, Stephen]|[]|European Planning Studies|1995|3|3|357-380|10.1080/09654319508720311|pub.1019699760|19;[Taubman, Geoffry]|[ur.013537475423.33]|Political Communication|1998|15|2|255-272|10.1080/10584609809342369|pub.1025475558|74;[Falch, Morten; Anyimadu, Amos]|[ur.013275464145.07; ur.013660367715.22]|Telecommunications Policy|2003|27|1-2|21-39|10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00092-7|pub.1025724859|31;[Coates, Ken; Holroyd, Carin]|[ur.016060567165.18; ur.014066341307.19]||2003||||10.1057/9781403990075|pub.1026672802|29;[Zhang, Bing]|[]|Telematics and Informatics|2002|19|4|331-349|10.1016/s0736-5853(01)00022-3|pub.1027906615|30;[Tan, Zixiang]|[ur.013340022455.08]|Telecommunications Policy|1995|19|9|721-731|10.1016/0308-5961(95)00036-4|pub.1031806234|25;[Wu, Wei]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1996|20|9|699-711|10.1016/s0308-5961(96)00050-x|pub.1034932818|33;[Zixiang, Tan]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1999|23|3-4|261-276|10.1016/s0308-5961(99)00007-5|pub.1036102052|42;[Walcott, Susan M.; Wheeler, James O.]|[ur.011537053213.48; ur.010034174305.23]|Urban Geography|2001|22|4|316-339|10.2747/0272-3638.22.4.316|pub.1038378526|34;[Anchordoguy, Marie]|[ur.013360745147.75]|The Business History Review|2001|75|3|507-541|10.2307/3116385|pub.1041836681|30;[Yang, Guobin]|[]|The China Quarterly|2005|181||46-66|10.1017/s0305741005000032|pub.1054082379|269;[Pack, H.]|[]|The World Bank Research Observer|2006|21|2|267-297|10.1093/wbro/lkl001|pub.1060065614|226;[Hackler, Darrene]|[ur.013360441435.37]|American Behavioral Scientist|2003|46|8|1034-1055|10.1177/0002764202250493|pub.1063544756|29;[SEGAL, ADAM; THUN, ERIC]|[; ]|Politics & Society|2001|29|4|557-588|10.1177/0032329201029004004|pub.1063655225|56;[Hackler, Darrene]|[ur.013360441435.37]|Urban Affairs Review|2003|39|1|59-86|10.1177/1078087403253054|pub.1063965288|24;[Röller, Lars-Hendrik; Waverman, Leonard]|[ur.015270256445.92; ur.015703454717.79]|American Economic Review|2001|91|4|909-923|10.1257/aer.91.4.909|pub.1064527330|927;[Harwit, Eric]|[]|Pacific Affairs|1998|71|2|175|10.2307/2760975|pub.1070089402|29;[Godement, François]|[]||1999||||10.4324/9780203258668|pub.1095908120|33;[]|[]|Who was Who in the People's Republic of China|1997||||10.1515/9783110968231|pub.1096968032|13;[Steinfeld, Edward S.]|[]||1998||||10.1017/cbo9780511625831|pub.1098666478|238;[Gilboy, George J.]|[ur.07601232711.96]|FOREIGN AFFAIRS|2004|83|4|33|10.2307/20034045|pub.1102751739|109;[Krugman, Paul]|[ur.014547664317.69]|FOREIGN AFFAIRS|1994|73|6|62|10.2307/20046929|pub.1102759649|1303"

Recent discourse on the momentous diffusion of mobile telephony in developing countries has questioned the rationale of promoting fixed shared access, since people are bound to prefer mobile phones over shared access points. This paper seeks to empirically explore the use of shared access points in the wake of the increasing diffusion and usage of mobile technology. We explored the actual use of shared computing facilities, the benefits users accrue from using the facilities and the challenges they face in using and in gaining benefits. We used a case study of a shared facility in a disadvantaged community in Cape Town. The study noted that the demand for the shared facilities is still high. We noted that the center is used for both instrumental and hedonic purposes. It was also noted that there are economic, social and psychological benefits from using the facilities. However, it was noted that use of the facilities is beset by a number of challenges which limit use and benefits from the usage. The paper also noted the strategies users employ to overcome the challenges.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2011,49,1,1-14,"Chigona, Wallace; Lekwane, Ofentse; Westcott, Kim; Chigona, Agnes",University of Cape Town; Cape Peninsula University of Technology,South Africa; South Africa,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099626705,10,"[Morrison, Keith; Manion, Lawrence; Cohen, Louis]|[; ; ]||2007||||10.4324/9780203029053|pub.1016282709|3406;[Du Toit, Andries]|[ur.010167142303.26]|Development and Change|2004|35|5|987-1010|10.1111/j.1467-7660.2004.00389.x|pub.1019858046|106;[Rao, Siriginidi Subba]|[ur.07577615655.15]|International Journal of Information Management|2008|28|6|474-482|10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2008.01.001|pub.1023904604|41;[Rao, Siriginidi Subba]|[ur.07577615655.15]|Telematics and Informatics|2005|22|4|361-375|10.1016/j.tele.2005.01.007|pub.1027181732|82;[Maslow, A.

This paper presents a broadband Internet access paradigm developed in the context of the ADHOCSYS project, which was financed by the European Commission under the 6th Framework Program Information and Society Technologies, within the strategic objective of Broadband for All. Aiming at providing reliable Internet access in rural and mountainous regions where xDSL connections are not available due to coverage limit, the ADHOCSYS network provides a cost-effective solution based on multi-hop wireless mesh network technologies. Starting from a general description of the network architecture and application scenarios, this paper focuses on presenting the routing, QoS and network deployment aspects of the developed solution. Other aspects like reliability prediction, power supply, security and authentication, and auto-configuration, etc are discussed only briefly. In order to validate the developed broadband access solution, a real-life operational wireless mesh network has been deployed in a mountainous region in Northern Italy. The performance of the developed solution has been evaluated based on the deployed real-life network, and the obtained numerical experimental results, along with the practical lessons learnt through installations and experiments are also presented in this paper.",Wireless Personal Communications,2010,58,4,807-829,"Li, Frank Y.; Bucciol, Paolo; Vandoni, Lorenzo; Fragoulis, Nikos; Zanoli, Stefano; Leschiutta, Luca; Lázaro, Oscar",University of Agder; National Research Council; University of Patras; Polytechnic University of Turin; Innovalia Association,Norway; Italy; Greece; Italy; Spain,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033751229,3,"[Akyildiz, Ian F.; Wang, Xudong; Wang, Weilin]|[ur.011747477217.24; ur.014422467153.50; ]|Computer Networks|2005|47|4|445-487|10.1016/j.comnet.2004.12.001|pub.1004000795|2843;[Tanigawa, Yosuke; Kim, Jong-Ok; Tode, Hideki; Murakami, Koso]|[ur.012270630371.24; ur.07635121311.22; ur.011061112175.09; ur.014535400211.08]|Proceeding of the 2006 international conference on Communications and mobile computing  - IWCMC '06|2006|||1147-1152|10.1145/1143549.1143779|pub.1019536410|10;[Akyildiz, Ian F.; Rudin, Harry]|[ur.011747477217.24; ur.014051054767.54]|Computer Networks|2005|47|4|443-444|10.1016/j.comnet.2005.01.002|pub.1053607576|72;[Dixit, Sudhir; Pandharipande, Ashish]|[ur.011767275726.26; ur.010262252640.24]|IEEE Communications Magazine|2007|45|1|92-95|10.1109/mcom.2007.284543|pub.1061394484|5;[Zimmermann, Alexander; Güne§, Mesut; Wenig, Martin; Ritzerfeld, Jan; Meis, Ulrich]|[ur.015455470074.11; ur.011635243417.53; ur.014672462532.79; ur.016446623142.21; ur.07452063766.18]|2006 1st Workshop on Operator-Assisted (Wireless Mesh) Community Networks|2006|||1-9|10.1109/woacn.2006.337189|pub.1093480640|3;[Aure, Thomas; Li, Frank Y.]|[; ur.015530241740.84]|2008 IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems|2008|||359-363|10.1109/iswcs.2008.4726077|pub.1093697529|6;[Leschiutta, Luca; Zicca, Giampietro; Li, Frank Y.; Vandoni, Lorenzo; Fragoulis, Nikos]|[ur.013251646375.74; ur.015475715761.45; ur.015530241740.84; ur.014700335361.94; ur.015324010053.38]|2007 16th IST Mobile and Wireless Communications Summit|2007|||1-5|10.1109/istmwc.2007.4299116|pub.1094881444|2"

Giving an opportunity to the vast majority of the population living in rural areas, to cross the digital divide to obtain access to information resources and services provided by ICT is the next revolution waiting to happen. Although this is a development issue, it is just not the government, non-government organizations or the rural masses that have a role to play. Private profit-making institutions can develop solutions to capture the hitherto unrecognized markets, make profits and at the same time aid the rural societies. The new technologies being developed can help surmount barriers present in providing information resources at a low cost and make applications feasible and profitable. This paper presents some cases where ICT has been effectively used for the benefit of the rural societies and analyzes the opportunities that lie in this sphere. The cases range from successful use of ICT in governance, to ICT solutions for improved profits to ICT in microfinance. A case of an initiative by a large mainstream corporation to reach out to the rural sector, help in development and realize profits mutually is also presented. The projects discussed should generate more interest and facilitate private investment in the hitherto virgin territory.

As a consequence, they have had a radical and widespread impact on our moral lives and hence on contemporary ethical debates. Consider the following list: PAPA (privacy, accuracy, intellectual property and access); ‘the triple A’ (availability, accessibility and accuracy of information); ownership and piracy; the digital divide; infoglut and research ethics; safety, reliability and trustworthiness of complex systems; viruses, hacking and other forms of digital vandalism; freedom of expression and censorship; pornography; monitoring and surveillance; security and secrecy; propaganda; identity theft; the construction of the self; panmnemonic issues and personal identity; new forms of agency (artificial and hybrid), of responsibility and accountability; roboethics and the moral status of artificial agents; e-conflicts; the re-prioritization of values and virtues…these are only some of the pressing issues that characterize the ethical discourse in our information societies. They are the subject of information and computer ethics (ICE), a new branch of applied ethics that investigates the transformations brought about by ICTs and their implications for the future of human life and society, for the evolution of moral values and rights, and for the evaluation of agents' behaviours. Since the seventies, ICE has been a standard topic in many curricula. In recent years, there has been a flourishing of new university courses, international conferences, workshops, professional organizations, specialized publications and research centres.",The Cambridge Handbook of Information and Computer Ethics,2009,,,ix-xv,"Floridi, Luciano",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009271912,0,

This is a long process based on the promulgation of inclusive laws, specification of accessibility guidelines, and development of adequate design methodologies and tools. To the short term, websites that do not fulfil the Universal Accessibility specifications can be used by specific groups of users that are not affected by the barriers present in these websites.

In our disparate world characterized by major differences between income levels, religion, language, economic development, technology penetration, infrastructure, information access, and knowledge of people, it is essential to develop and implement integrated short term and long term programs to share the benefits of this “new brave world”. In this regards, the situation of the developing countries is most crucial and challengeable. One of the most important factors that can help developing countries to bridge this meta-digital divide is Human Resource Development (HRD) for Information Technology and the E-activity age. The Islamic Republic of Iran is trying to be an effective part of the information age society among the developing countries. Despite the attractive capacity of Iran's human resources and regarding the geo-economical and geopolitical positions of Iran, it is necessary to develop integrated HRD programs to lead and manage this inevitable process. In this article, the possible HRD approaches investigated and analyzed. With emphasizing on the human resources, we studied the current situations of Iran in terms of different aspects of digital age and using a conceptual model assessed appropriate approaches of developing human resources for society of Iran with the aim of accelerating the speed of its growth and adaptation in the digital age.",2006 Technology Management for the Global Future - PICMET 2006 Conference,2006,3,,1186-1202,"Sameni, M.

However, recent figures show that the Internet users scenario is much varied, and localisation confirms itself as the major business strategy of multinational companies offering online services and products. This paper focuses on the GILT dynamics (Globalisation, Internationalisation, Localisation and Translation) and aims to shed light on their impact at the level of access to and usability of digital contents. In particular, an accurate globalisation strategy and software internationalisation are discussed as the key factors to global effectiveness. The proposed pilot study analyses the contents of two commercial web sites provided by JAL (Japan Airlines) for purchasing a domestic flight in Japan, contrasting the Japanese and English versions. The results will be discussed in terms of the main localisation, internationalisation and usability features. The primary research question is if the English user can receive the same service from the self-service ticketing web site originally designed for the Japanese user. Furthermore, the results of JAL case study carried out from downstream localisation to upstream GILT strategies will help illustrate the initial premises on the importance of planning a truly global communication strategy.

Unfortunately, the majority of these programs are small and mimic what has been successful in the developed world. It has become increasingly clear that these successes do not necessarily translate well in the context of developing nations. This paper develops the hypothesis that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) projects in developing countries will become successful only when they are adapted to local conditions. The general concept of Appropriate Technology (AT) will be explored for the field of ICT. AT has already been embraced by fields like architecture, building technology and agriculture, but has not yet been rooted in ICT. The paper proposes a preliminary theory of Appropriate ICT along the lines of existing theories in AT and System development. The theory identifies Appropriate Technology principles at three levels: hardware, software and ICT change management. By means of real life mini cases in the ICT for Development context in Africa, the guiding principles for Appropriate ICT are illustrated. The paper will conclude with an agenda for further research in the three identified levels.

pub.1023934185,10.1353/lib.2011.0006,Recent Trends in UK Prison Libraries,"The purpose of this article is to explore and explain the significant developments and trends in prison libraries over the last thirty years. The article includes sections on legislation affecting prison libraries, staffing arrangements, roles and responsibilities of HMP (Her Majesty's Prison) Service, and UK Local Authorities. The work of the Prison Libraries Group (PrLG) of the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) is examined in detail, as are the management of prison libraries and the methods of inspections and audits. The article examines the challenges of trying to engage an often disaffected population with diverse needs. Training requirements and opportunities for prison staff are investigated, as this is a crucial element in prison library work. The article concludes that the prison library is at the heart of the prisoners' learning journey by assisting in functional and emotional literacy. Not only can the prison library help to bridge the digital divide and increase prisoners ICT skills, it also can instill a love of books and reading through exciting reader development projects. The author hopes that funding for prison libraries continues at its present level in order to maintain an excellent service to prisoners and to ensure that providers are able to deliver an affordable service within a reasonable timeframe. The article will be of interest to prison library staff, local authority staff with responsibility for library services to prison facilities, and library and information science students.

These phenomena are aided and propelled by a new “network intelligence” consummated in the introduction of information and communication technology (ICT). The world has also witnessed a reinvention of the whole process of governance that has impacted society in various ways. Through the Internet and digital connectivity, today’s world has come to be closer than ever before. Efficiency and processes of governance have been improved through faster information flow in the governance chain. Bottlenecks and cost of labor have been reduced across the world. Furthermore, ICT has opened new possibilities, improved transparency and access to information as well as partnership and collaboration, leading to improved relationships between the citizen and state. While Europe and North America, as well as some countries of Asia and the pacific, have taken advantage of this development to improve their economies and governance process, Ningo (1999) observes that sub-Saharan Africa has remained either passive or in the periphery, often reduced to a consumer for reasons related to its history or its system of governance—or lack of one. This has led to a yawning digital divide (especially between Africa and developed states of the world. What led to this divide and how can Africa, then, benefit from this revolution?

Respectively, virtual organizations are gaining grounds in the education sector with its vehicle capable of closing the digital divide and spreading knowledge that can help improve the literacy rate. This article covers the case of the Regional IT Institute (RITI), an institute located in Cairo, Egypt, that specializes in providing quality education in the fields of information and communication technology and management. The institute’s goal is to educate more students while overcoming the challenge of scarce resources, trying to meet the needs of 30% of the population (70 million) enrolled in education programs (Economic News Bulletin). The model used by the institute in delivering its programs is a hybrid model that combines traditional with unconventional techniques, capitalizing on normal class settings as well as advanced information and communication technology tools. In 1985, information technology was prioritized on the national agenda by the government of Egypt, so information technology became one of the building blocks of the development process. Moreover, in 1999, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology was established to accelerate the build up of the nation’s information and communications infrastructure and the creation of a mechanism for knowledge acquisition and dissemination to bridge the gap between “the haves and the have-nots,” both internally and with the developed world.","Encyclopedia of Distance Learning, Second Edition",2009,,,2275-2281,"Rogers, Patricia L.; Berg, Gary A.; Boettcher, Judith V.; Howard, Caroline; Justice, Lorraine; Schenk, Karen D.; Kamel, Sherif",American University in Cairo,Egypt,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007276047,0,[]|[]|Choice|1996|33|05|33-2827-33-2827|10.5860/choice.33-2827|pub.1073334553|39
pub.1016835958,10.1057/ejis.2008.4,Beyond organisational agendas: using boundary critique to facilitate the inclusion of societal concerns in information systems planning,"As the development of the information society takes place worldwide, individuals, groups and organisations face the challenge of taking advantage of information and communication technologies (ICTs). ‘Digital divides’ are emerging: some sections of society are gaining access to information, knowledge and technologies while others are being excluded. There also seems to be an over-concentration on the use of ICTs for organisational purposes, with traditional information systems (IS) planning approaches largely ignoring the needs and concerns that people express outside formal organisations. One answer to this problem might be to adopt a systems approach to IS planning. At first sight this appears to be a good idea because of the aspiration of systems approaches to comprehensiveness, presumably looking beyond organisational concerns. However, a review of two popular systems methodologies employed in IS planning suggests that there is potential for their scope to be equally limited by organisational boundaries. There is a need to enhance the critical review of the boundaries of IS planning processes, enabling people to consider family, community and other concerns. In this paper, we use the systems theory of boundary critique to derive a set of questions to help practitioners reflect on different possible boundaries for IS planning exercises. These should be seen as complementary to existing systems approaches rather than as a replacement for them, enabling the latter to be practised more critically. We end by presenting our reflections on using these questions in the context of an IS planning project in a Colombian University.",European Journal of Information Systems,2008,17,2,125-142,"Córdoba, José-Rodrigo; Midgley, Gerald",University of Hull; Victoria University of Wellington; University of Canterbury; University of Queensland,United Kingdom; New Zealand; New Zealand; Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016835958,33,"[Bennetts, Peter D.

pub.1095462609,10.1109/iscit.2007.4392217,Feasibility Study for ECommerce and ICT Diffusion-adoption in EAC,"Ecommerce technology can reduce poverty by improving people's access to educations, healthy, government and financial services. Ecommerce also can help small farmers and artisans by connecting them to markets. It is clear that in rural and urban East African countries (EAC) as well as in much of the developing world-realization of this potential is not guaranteed. We study a simple bilateral model in which ICTs, are initially endowed with ability, decide sequentially (1) whether can act as producers of (eCommerce's) or as investors (rentiers) and, then (2) which quantity of investment they would like to bring, through educations and Information Technology revolutions to poor rural area people in (EAC) so that these two (education and IT) can be well adopted and defused by integrating them to commercial life. We show the existence of “natural equilibria”, at which ICT become source and capital for eCommerce's while the remaining ones decide to be rentiers. We outlines a simple model to explain why a digital divide may exist between rich and poor, realizing the impact of eCommerce that can be executed over the internet has a potential towards economy growth. Low-cost access to information infrastructure is necessary prerequisite for the successful use of eCommerce by the poor, but it is not sufficient. The implementation of eCommerce projects needs to be performed by organizations and individuals who have the appropriate incentives to work with marginalized groups. Furthermore, the readinesses of EAC involvement as a community are identified as the key factors that foster local people to be connected to digital world.",2007 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies,2007,,,1297-1302,"Oreku, George S; Jiangzhong, Li; Mtenzi, Fredrick J.",Technological University Dublin,Ireland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095462609,0,"[Johnstone, Justine]|[]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2003|||307-322|10.1007/978-0-387-35695-2_19|pub.1018953903|2;[Moore, G.

pub.1019892459,10.1007/0-387-34588-4_14,Social Inclusion and the Shifting Role of Technology: Is Age the New Gender in Mobile Access?,"Information and communication technologies (ICT) are at the heart of government social inclusion policy. However, the “digital divide” remains and social inclusion and technology are closely linked: Not having access to technology is often seen both as part of the inclusion/exclusion problem and part of the solution by enabling access to information resources through different channels. Yet, we argue that by using technology to address an inclusion/exclusion problem, it will also result in moving the problem from one area to another. The arguments in this paper have been informed by two empirical studies around a ubiquitous technology, the mobile phone. One study is primarily based on the 18 to 25 year old age groups; the other mostly on retired people. The studies show clear differences between age groups and gender in adoption and use of the mobile telephone.Social inclusion is multifaceted; it is not an either/or measure and many attributes are subjective and depend on context. Social inclusion for mobile access is also closely linked to deeply embedded structures within society, such as those traditionally associated with gender. Technology may be changing these structures; indeed, age may be the new gender. The family or social unit may also be a useful entity to consider in the exclusion debate. Technology is being used to address social exclusion; however, we suggest that while some leveling may result, there may also be different social exclusion fronts emerging.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2006,208,,203-215,"Adams, Carl; Fitch, Tineke",University of Portsmouth,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019892459,6,"[Hebert, M A]|[]|Health Services Management Research|1998|11|2|69-79|10.1177/095148489801100201|pub.1000627749|20;[Heiskanen, Tuula; Rantalaiho, Liisa]|[ur.015426223576.00; ur.01115525200.38]|Gendered Practices in Working Life|1997|||191-196|10.1007/978-1-349-25285-5_12|pub.1010615420|5;[Adams, Carl; Fitch, Tineke]|[ur.010024575365.47; ur.016263210645.35]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2005|158||341-349|10.1007/0-387-22874-8_25|pub.1043530377|1;[Rantalaiho, Liisa; Heiskanen, Tuula]|[]|Gendered Practices in Working Life|1997||||10.1007/978-1-349-25285-5|pub.1051081342|48;[Warschauer, Mark]|[]|First Monday|2002|7|7||10.5210/fm.v7i7.967|pub.1072710766|277;[]|[]||2007||||10.4018/978-1-59140-884-0|pub.1096031120|64;[Wallace, Patricia]|[]||1999||||10.1017/cbo9780511581670|pub.1098665288|380"
pub.1048305380,10.1016/j.chb.2010.02.008,Towards a unified Media-User Typology (MUT): A meta-analysis and review of the research literature on media-user typologies,"Considering the increasingly complex media landscape and diversity of use, it is important to establish a common ground for identifying and describing the variety of ways in which people use new media technologies. Characterising the nature of media-user behaviour and distinctive user types is challenging and the literature offers little guidance in this regard. Hence, the present research aims to classify diverse user behaviours into meaningful categories of user types, according to the frequency of use, variety of use and content preferences. To reach a common framework, a review of the relevant research was conducted. An overview and meta-analysis of the literature (22 studies) regarding user typology was established and analysed with reference to (1) method, (2) theory, (3) media platform, (4) context and year, and (5) user types. Based on this examination, a unified Media-User Typology (MUT) is suggested. This initial MUT goes beyond the current research literature, by unifying all the existing and various user type models. A common MUT model can help the Human–Computer Interaction community to better understand both the typical users and the diversification of media-usage patterns more qualitatively.

pub.1063752250,10.1177/016555159902500603,Information and knowledge in the age of electronic communication: a developing country perspective,"The current digital revolution, the fourth information revolution in history after the invention of writing, the book and printing, has serious potential to exacerbate the gulf between the North and the South. As has been observed in the USA, even within an affluent country, with inadequate policy interventions, information technology not only widens the digital divide but also deepens the racial ravine. The implications of the new information and communication technologies (ICTs) for science and scholarship and for development are examined. The maldistribution of access to ICTs - telephones, computers, networks, Internet, bandwidth and electronic journals - is bound to make it even more difficult for the developing countries to contribute to, and take advantage of, knowledge in the sciences. These countries will get further marginalised. As suggested by Bruce Alberts, President of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, knowledge dissemination structures need to be put in place which are not entirely based on commerce. Innovative models, such as the community access model of the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, which attempts to transform the otherwise divisive information technologies into allies in the equity movement, can make a difference to the life of the rural poor. The Swaminathan model emphasises delivering locale-specific knowledge that the people actually need and can use to improve their lot. The model follows a bottom-up approach, involving the user community as partners right from the beginning, emphasises knowledge delivery and uses technology - a hybrid wired and wireless network - only when it is necessary to achieve its major goal of knowledge delivery.",Journal of Information Science,1999,25,6,465-476,"Arunachalam, Subbiah",M S Swaminathan Research Foundation,India,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063752250,37,"[Frame, J.

pub.1045508944,10.1108/00242530510588935,The public library system in India: challenges and opportunities,"The current situation of Indian public libraries has been viewed by some as follows: the public library system in India is condemned to remain peripheral to the actual information needs of the masses; that it is in a depressed state, and serves as little more than a warehouse of recreational reading materials, a majority of which are in regional languages. This paper suggests possible remedies on how to transform the situation, and details new technological developments which are already showing the potential to change public libraries in rural India for the better. A descriptive account of the contemporary situation in India with regard to public libraries, digital technologies and development possibilities, using official statistics and the LIS literature. The challenges that face public libraries in India are listed and a vision for their future based on the concept of “ICT for development” is sketched out. It is difficult to get an overall view of this topic: authorized statistics on public libraries in India as a whole are not collected, because these libraries are the responsibility of a variety of agencies who, for various reasons, never disclose such information on a national scale. The author details new technological developments, the practical outcome of which would in particular facilitate the establishment of digital library services in rural India. This paper provides a useful overview of a library scenario on which aggregated statistical data is hard to find; and, from this summary of the present situation, goes on to suggest possible ways to transform the “digital divide” into “digital opportunities”.",Library Review,2005,54,3,180-191,"Ghosh, Maitrayee",University of Mumbai,India,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045508944,22,"[Nicholas, David; Huntington, Paul; Williams, Peter]|[ur.011274653015.81; ur.0700306724.27; ur.01233510277.60]|Aslib Journal of Information Management|2002|54|6|372-384|10.1108/00012530210452573|pub.1006882081|10;[NATH, VIKAS]|[]|The International Information & Library Review|2001|33|4|317-339|10.1006/iilr.2001.0175|pub.1008977527|35;[Williamson, Kirsty; Schauder, Don; Stockfield, Louise; Wright, Steve; Bow, Amanda]|[ur.016713672371.19; ur.07733556123.12; ; ur.016571164430.16; ur.014132057323.18]|Journal of the Australian Library and Information Association|2001|50|2|157-174|10.1080/00049670.2001.10755951|pub.1022892300|14;[Stoker, David]|[ur.011624175705.41]|Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|2000|32|2|53-55|10.1177/096100060003200201|pub.1026199854|3;[Evald, Pierre]|[]|Program|1996|Volume 30|Issue 2|121-131|10.1108/eb047222|pub.1032257476|3;[ARORA, JAGDISH]|[ur.015453270407.41]|The International Information & Library Review|2001|33|2-3|149-165|10.1006/iilr.2001.0165|pub.1032375850|8;[Edwards, Christopher]|[]|IFLA Journal|2001|27|2|65-69|10.1177/034003520102700205|pub.1033760545|7;[Yilmaz, Bülent]|[ur.01116743406.96]|Aslib Journal of Information Management|2002|54|5|326-334|10.1108/00012530210448271|pub.1038046918|2;[Fors, Martina; Moreno, Alfredo]|[; ]|Aslib Journal of Information Management|2002|54|3|198-206|10.1108/00012530210441746|pub.1048224053|27"
pub.1038939878,10.1016/b978-155558290-6/50016-x,13 The Future of Socially Responsible Information Technology Management,"This chapter discusses the future of socially responsible information technology. There are economic profits to socially responsible information technology management but achieving that benefit requires time and resources. There are numerous socially responsible information technology management programs in place around the world. Many countries are commencing to duplicate programs that have been successful in other countries. There have been myriad efforts to reduce the digital divide, utilize more energy-efficient technology, and better safeguard the privacy of information. The development of better applications that require less staff to maintain and operate, the creation of better protection for digital properties, and the production of more energy-efficient out-of-the-box technology and components are in progress. Technology manufacturers are moving at a steady pace in achieving these goals. These goals occupy third or fourth place compared with efforts to gain market share and maintain profits. One of the most vital environmental developments affecting business is the new standard for environmental management, ISO 14001. This standard is being increasingly adopted by many companies worldwide, with considerable activity in major sectors such as the motor and electronics industries. There are now many social, political, and economic forces that drive changes in how information technology will be developed and how information technology will be used in the future. Economic impact is measured by the costs to clean viruses from networks, servers, and client systems; the costs to restore lost or damaged files; and the lost productivity of workers caused by system outages and downtime.",Socially Responsible IT Management,2003,,,333-342,"Erbschloe, Michael",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038939878,0,

This is one part of the E-namokun project, an information promotion project started in Nagoya city, Japan. E-namoSupport is a helpdesk system that has the following characteristics: (1) unlike general helpdesk systems, which generally only cover one organization, E-namoSupport has been developed through joint government, university, and NPO cooperation; (2) users are senior citizens with little or no PC experience; (3) its aim is not only to solve problems or answer questions, but also helping senior citizens learn more computer knowledge and further their computer skills. In the E-namoSupport environment we have developed four subsystems: a case trace system (CTS); a consultation management system (CMS); an FAQ System (FAQS); and an FAQ analysis system (FAQAS). We propose an information cycle model that efficiently manages information flow in the four subsystems as well as in organizations. We take senior citizens’ attributes into account using a set of quizzes that help operators describe enquiry cases and make conversation flow more smoothly. We also design an easy-to-use interface and functions that help users access FAQS. Moreover, we develop E-namoSupport as a learning environment, providing suitable learning contents by analysing users’ interests and needs, which helps users to improve their IT abilities of and enjoy life in the information age.",Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2007,1,,295-306,"Zhou, Wei; Yasuda, Takami; Yokoi, Shigeki",Nagoya University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1031275955,0,"[Halverson, Christine A.; Erickson, Thomas; Ackerman, Mark S.]|[ur.011420535174.75; ur.010411062343.21; ur.014566132275.29]|Proceedings of the 2004 ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work  - CSCW '04|2004|||304-313|10.1145/1031607.1031657|pub.1031342082|38;[Peters, Sandra L.]|[]|Proceedings of the 20th annual ACM SIGUCCS conference on User services  - SIGUCCS '92|1992|||187-191|10.1145/143164.143303|pub.1032058794|3;[Foo, Schubert; Hui, Siu Cheung; Leong, Peng Chor]|[ur.011124171133.65; ur.015501337641.16; ur.015247642351.56]|International Journal of Systems Science|2002|33|6|389-402|10.1080/00207720210133642|pub.1038560034|9;[Sasaki, Kiichirou; Iribe, Yurie; Goto, Masato; Endo, Mamoru; Yasuda, Takami; Yoko, Shigeki]|[; ur.010405245445.71; ur.013422004453.14; ur.015160755445.10; ur.015452033001.60; ]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2005|3683||1274-1280|10.1007/11553939_177|pub.1043645612|1"

Design/methodology/approach The paper first analyzes the definition and features of the digital library, and is followed by an introduction to the development of VRS in China. Through literature search and checking web sites, some 400 documents in CNKI have been analysed on VRS from the period of January, 1990 to June, 2005, and the situation in developing VRS and problems existing in the course of doing it in China have been summarized. On the basis of connecting theory and practice on VRS, the paper provides general tactics on how to develop VRS for libraries in China.   Findings There are some problems existing for China to develop VRS, namely shortage of funds, the information poor, the digital divide, restrictions of information infrastructure, library management, shortage of technical knowledge and user training. The paper projects what may be needed for China to continue its development of VRS in the future. There is a need for appropriate infrastructures, strategies and mechanisms to be established in order to support the diffusion of VRS principles throughout China.   Originality/value This paper provides some observations and insights on the design and development of VRS in China.

Most means for stimulating active communications depend on visual information. To classify human sensations, the phrase of “five senses” consisting of vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell, has been used from olden days. This classification is triggered by the ancient Greeks. However, there are at least nine types or over twenty types of human sensory channels if the classification is considered from a practical standpoint. In the case of touch sensation, it tells the brain not only simple skin sensations, pain, and temperature, but also a variety of sensations such as pressure and vibration. As you can easily experience when you browse web pages on the Internet, the current web technology enables the visualization of their contents, it does not provide any means to convey other sensory information. Consequently, we focus on the tactile information as a way for enabling multisensory communication and we are conducting a research project for designing and developing a “haptization” based communication framework and its application systems. It is not just a vision targeted at people with disabilities, and we would like to eye pregnant, elderly, and the weak in information technology who called “digital divide”. Such people ordinarily have difficulties for obtaining information as various reasons. We report our past activities and a questionnaire survey for exploring problems such as what is the impact of haptization to use as a communication mean, and what are technical issues for implementing a good solution.","2010 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems",2010,,,1153-1157,"Eiji, AOKI; HIROOKA, Junji; NAGATOMO, Nobuhiro; OSADA, Toshihiko; NISHINO, Hiroaki; UTSUMIYA, Kouichi",Oita University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095748357,6,

pub.1061395128,10.1109/mcom.2009.5307483,Economic engineering for improving access to the worldwide telecommunications network,"Telecommunications services are not equally available to everyone in the world. This disparity, often called the digital divide, is the topic of much talk, but little progress has been made. Service providers in affluent regions prosper, because they can make a profit. In regions where few people are able to pay market rates, there is little, if any, service without subsidies. However, when subsidies support telecommunications service, the funds are given to existing, typically monopoly, providers, and are often misused. This article defines a concept of how subsidy funds can be directed to consumers. When implemented, this concept provides consumers with the purchasing power needed to buy services; thereby it emulates conditions in an affluent region and attracts entrepreneurs to supply services in response to demand. We believe that this will stimulate profitable business for telecommunications operators to deliver services on an ongoing basis in poor regions. First, however, funds are needed to support the process. They could be supplied by grants from major funding organizations, such as the World Bank and USAID. Long-term sustainability is proposed via contributions from existing telecommunications users through a small tax on their bills. This would ensure continuous support from within the industry with no need to apply for periodic grant renewals. While implementing these techniques is difficult, they employ principles that are already in use. This concept lends itself to a small-scale testing and demonstration, possibly through a pilot project.

Giving an opportunity to the vast majority of the population living in rural areas, to cross the digital divide to obtain access to information resources and services provided by ICT is the next revolution waiting to happen. Although this is a development issue, it is just not the government, non-government organizations or the rural masses that have a role to play. Private profit-making institutions can develop solutions to capture the hitherto unrecognized markets, make profits and at the same time aid the rural societies. The new technologies being developed can help surmount barriers present in providing information resources at a low cost and make applications feasible and profitable. This paper presents some cases where ICT has been effectively used for the benefit of the rural societies and analyzes the opportunities that lie in this sphere. The cases range from successful use of ICT in governance, to ICT solutions for improved profits to ICT in microfinance. A case of an initiative by a large mainstream corporation to reach out to the rural sector, help in development and realize profits mutually is also presented. The projects discussed should generate more interest and facilitate private investment in the hitherto virgin territory.

Australia’s responded to this fear with a number of government-funded IT projects which were targeted at increasing access to and adoption of IT and e-commerce in the regional and SME communities. Many of these projects were developed at the local level through collaborative community-based programs. This reflected the federal government’s view that ‘the best and most workable solutions and ideas emerge from the grass roots, rather than being delivered, fully formed, from on high [as] community and non-profit groups and local-government authorities are attuned to the pulse of their communities [and] are best placed to know what their own needs and circumstances are’ (Williams, 2004). Some of these programs were led by local governments. These initiatives included setting up regional e-marketplaces (REMs) and internet trading platforms that would improve SME e-commerce uptake and lead to economic development. According to Standing et al., (2004) and Zimmerman (1998) the motivation behind such initiatives is the expectation of community benefits like raised levels of e-business knowledge, skills and technology within the community.",Electronic Markets,2009,,,190-211,"Gengatharen, Denise E.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1051147497,0,"[Pavlou, Paul A]|[ur.016166254325.43]|The Journal of Strategic Information Systems|2002|11|3-4|215-243|10.1016/s0963-8687(02)00017-3|pub.1008471298|265;[Hsiao, Ruey-Lin]|[ur.016210046213.37]|The Journal of Strategic Information Systems|2003|12|3|169-199|10.1016/s0963-8687(03)00034-9|pub.1015055011|64;[Standing, C.; Sims, I.; Stockdale, R.; Wassenaar, A.]|[ur.015164013172.43; ur.015677426077.21; ur.012776532416.29; ur.011043164665.23]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2003|||339-353|10.1007/978-0-387-35695-2_21|pub.1017065123|7;[Johnsen, Hans Chr Garmann; Normann, Roger]|[ur.010546140623.05; ur.012336167043.03]|Systemic Practice and Action Research|2004|17|3|207-235|10.1023/b:spaa.0000031698.50541.f9|pub.1017311100|26;[Lockett, Nigel; Brown, David H.]|[ur.013444152027.07; ur.01275132650.14]|International Small Business Journal Researching Entrepreneurship|2006|24|4|379-404|10.1177/0266242606065509|pub.1019961792|18;[Bakos, Yannis]|[ur.011426007706.48]|Communications of the ACM|1998|41|8|35-42|10.1145/280324.280330|pub.1027968897|780;[Patnasingam, Pauline; Gefen, David; Pavlou, Paul A.]|[; ur.010724440512.07; ur.016166254325.43]|Journal of Electronic Commerce in Organizations|2005|3|3|69-82|10.4018/jeco.2005070105|pub.1048910625|49;[Brown, David H.; Lockett, Nigel J.]|[; ur.013444152027.07]|Electronic Markets|2001|11|1|52-58|10.1080/10196780151105429|pub.1058356286|23;[Ba, Sulin; Whinston, Andrew B.; Zhang, Han]|[ur.013163764407.01; ur.07640513512.21; ]|Electronic Markets|2001|11|1|59-63|10.1080/10196780151105447|pub.1058356287|4;[Fisher, Julie; Craig, Annemieke]|[; ]|Electronic Markets|2005|15|2|136-145|10.1080/10196780500083811|pub.1058356439|12;[Steinfield, Alwin Mahler, Johannes, Charles]|[]|Electronic Markets|1999|9|1-2|51-57|10.1080/101967899359247|pub.1058356806|52;[Steinfield, Charles; Whitten, Pamela]|[ur.013651017147.33; ur.0642072641.92]|Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|2006|5|2|0-0|10.1111/j.1083-6101.1999.tb00338.x|pub.1061923603|58;[Steinfield, Charles; Bouwman, Harry; Adelaar, Thomas]|[ur.013651017147.33; ur.016372313030.67; ur.016640242443.05]|International Journal of Electronic Commerce|2002|7|1|93-119|10.1080/10864415.2002.11044254|pub.1092016489|126;[Standing, Craig; Sims, Ian; Stockdale, Rosemary; Gengatharen, Denise; Standing, Susan; Wassenaar, Arjen]|[ur.015164013172.43; ur.015677426077.21; ur.012776532416.29; ur.011514757172.46; ur.013406010776.41; ur.011043164665.23]|The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries|2004|20|1|1-14|10.1002/j.1681-4835.2004.tb00130.x|pub.1099632717|4;[Klein, Heinz K.; Myers, Michael D.]|[; ]|MIS Quarterly|1999|23|1|67|10.2307/249410|pub.1102515063|2232;[Kumar, Kuldeep; van Dissel, Han G.; Bielli, Paola]|[ur.07715504326.82; ur.015274616454.71; ]|MIS Quarterly|1998|22|2|199|10.2307/249395|pub.1102515084|148;[Ba, Sulin; Pavlou, Paul A.]|[ur.013163764407.01; ]|MIS Quarterly|2002|26|3|243|10.2307/4132332|pub.1102515120|1348"

It considers inclusive stakeholder organisational structures that could address unmet needs.   Design/methodology/approach Although the European Commission (EC), Member States, local authorities, industry, and researchers have called for greater collaboration and partnerships among stakeholders to overcome the so‐called digital divides, little attention has been giv]en to the form of collaboration. Reviewing various policy‐oriented documents, this paper compiles a list of principal stakeholders and their e‐inclusion needs, reviews existing multi‐stakeholder undertakings and partnership structures as candidates for addressing needs not already met.   Findings Many important e‐inclusion needs are not addressed by any multi‐stakeholder undertaking. Some structured collaboration or partnership should address those needs. A new structure should not merely represent all interested stakeholders, but involve them in decision‐making processes.   Research limitations/implications This is a conceptual paper, constrained by length from producing a detailed list of needs. Similarly, although the paper identifies 12 different stakeholder categories, some could be further segmented.   Practical implications Further research and analysis could be undertaken sourcing each identified need, perhaps adding others and further segmenting stakeholder categories.   Originality/value The paper is of value to stakeholders involved or interested in e‐inclusion efforts.

In order to accommodate the constant changes in information technology in the validity assessment of the instrument, the literacy diagnosis items cover a comprehensive range of abilities from computer use, based on the medias available in the early childhood education institutions, to the ability to communicate through various web programs. From the developmental model procedures, the researchers devised 64 items under the headings of planning and establishment, development of items, preliminary survey, and survey. The instrument can also be categorized into 3 subcategories of computer literacy, information literacy, and knowledge literacy, depending on the component factors, and this categorization takes into account the main digital literacy-related work that early childhood educators carry out in 3 work domains of 1) class management and office work, 2) child guidance, and 3) professional development. The validation findings reveal that the overall Cronbach's Alpha is very high, at .989, and internal consistency was found to exist in each factor and item. Also, the instrument was found to be very stable as a diagnostic instrument through cross validity and test-retest reliability tests. In sum, the validation process finds the instrument useful for assessing the digital literacy of early childhood educators and of assessing the current state of digital literacy in individual early childhood education institutions, thereby, where necessary, prompting specific steps to be taken in reducing the digital divide among education institutions.",Korean Journal of Early Childhood Education,2011,31,5,225-252,"허경아; Chung, Chung-Hee",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002665427,6,"[Bawden, David]|[]|Journal of Documentation|2001|57|2|218-259|10.1108/eum0000000007083|pub.1000197126|456"

This paper explores the opportunity for greater social integration based on the formation of community-based information communication technology (ICT) driven organizations, using a case study approach.  It is suggested that whether disseminating information, collaborating with other communities, assisting the development of new industries, or simply by sharing the lessons learned along the way, community-based IT can assist and support a community’s economic and social development.  Further, the paper supports the view that, where understanding and developing new forms of information technology through community informatics is accepted as an integral part of such development, communities will not just ‘improve the old’ but will more radically restructure themselves towards a knowledge-based future. The case study that underpins these observations is that of the development of Bay Connect, a community-based Internet development and training project, begun in Hervey Bay with Networking the Nation support, and which is now expanding into the adjacent Maryborough and surrounding Shires. It is also supported by the University of Southern Queensland’s Wide Bay and has an emergent role in supporting new and existing IT businesses, Bay Connect and the Hervey Bay City Council, in the creation and nurturing of an IT skills base within the region.",Global Information Technologies,2008,,,1656-1666,"Tan, Felix B.; Pease, Wayne; Wright, Lauretta; Cooper, Malcolm",University of Southern Queensland,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041952943,0,

The environmental factors analyzed here are market position, competitive intensity, and institutional pressures. SMEs have been grouped according to their level of e-business involvement, in relation to the number of e-business solutions adopted so far. Three layers are proposed: excluded, tentative, and integrated e-business SMEs. A multinomial logistic regression was used to predict these strategies. A general conclusion is that different models seem to explain exclusion and involvement. Specifically, two factors among those analyzed reveal to be more suitable in explaining e-business exclusion. They are the size of a SME and a lack of institutional pressures to adopt. On the other hand, e-business involvement seems to be primarily prompted by a selective competitive environment and not by imitative behaviors, as in the previous case.",Electronic Business,2009,,,185-196,"Lee, In; Arbore, Alessandro; Ordanini, Andrea",Bocconi University,Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023653812,2,

Another major challenge is the low level of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) skills, in addition to natural apathy of end-users for online services. Service delivery and access are two sides of a coin. The need to break the barrier created by the factors above and provide unimpeded access to services using non-conventional, innovative means has become very crucial. The paper presents the concept of the eTrade Distribution Network as a model for ameliorating the challenge posed by access to eGovernment services and products in a developing country. The paper examines the eTrade Distribution Network, its features, implementation strategies, business model, benefits etc and also takes a closer look at the eAgent component of the eTrade value chain and how it contributes to promoting awareness, bridging the digital gap, creating employment and providing a sustainable and affordable channel of access for online services to the citizenry.",Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance - ICEGOV '11,2011,,,67-72,"Agbabiaka, Olusegun; Adebusuyi, Gbenga",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038138413,4,

Virtual Age is an umbrella which empowers anywhere, anytime, anyone's interactions defying the existing time and space limitations we encounter today. Existence of a wide digital gap between developed and underdeveloped countries, hardware and software limitations, and lack of appropriate infrastructure are some of the problems to be overcome before the Virtual Age can be realized. Key evolving technologies for enabling full realization of virtual age include higher-speed CPU's, higher-speed transmission media (larger bandwidths), huge capacities of memory, and a significant number of sophisticated software. These key technologies have shown exponential growth progress and it is projected that hardware and software limitations will be overcome within about two decades allowing the realization of the Virtual Age.",2009 Sixth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations,2009,,,999-1004,"Mahmoodi, Hamid; Jalali, Ali A.",San Francisco State University; Iran University of Science and Technology,United States; Iran,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094148333,1,"[McEuen, Paul L.]|[ur.01277202621.80]|Nature|1998|393|6680|15-17|10.1038/29874|pub.1002292961|178;[Joachim, C.; Gimzewski, J.

If we want to achieve this goal we need to know the impact of not only age but also gender, educational background and frequency of internet use. Therefore, this paper presents the results of an explorative Dutch eye-tracking case study, which focuses on information search behaviour (navigation patterns and use of the search box, effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction). 29 younger and 29 older participants completed a search task on three websites. It was found that the greatest factor impacting on information search behaviour is not always age. In one case, heatmaps showed clearly that the navigation patterns of older participants using internet daily were quite similar to those of younger ones.

The environmental factors analyzed here are market position, competitive intensity, and institutional pressures. SMEs have been grouped according to their level of e-business involvement, in relation to the number of e-business solutions adopted so far. Three layers are proposed: excluded, tentative, and integrated e-business SMEs. A multinomial logistic regression was used to predict these strategies. A general conclusion is that different models seem to explain exclusion and involvement. Specifically, two factors among those analyzed reveal to be more suitable in explaining e-business exclusion. They are the size of a SME and a lack of institutional pressures to adopt. On the other hand, e-business involvement seems to be primarily prompted by a selective competitive environment and not by imitative behaviors, as in the previous case.",Handbook of Research on Global Diffusion of Broadband Data Transmission,2008,,,493-503,"Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Papazafeiropoulou, Anastasia; Choudrie, Jyoti; Arbore, Alessandro; Ordanini, Andrea",Bocconi University,Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027182534,0,

Efforts to identify factors that cause usability problems for the elderly users in using mobile phones can provide the groundwork for changes aimed at usability enhancement and design of interfaces of mobile phones. Background: It became important to understand the behaviors and tendencies of the elderly in communication as the society became older. The problems in digital divide is contributed to mainly lack of understanding in terms of the use pattern of the elderly and lack of consideration of their characteristics in designing user interfaces of most ICT devices. Method: A total of 30 elderly users who were over 65 years in age participated in usability evaluation test experiment and performed seven different tasks using a widely accepted model of universally designed mobile phone. Their performance was compared with that of contrast group that consisted of 10 younger participants who were on their 20s. Results: It was found that the elderly users had hard times in using mobile phones, especially in keypad manipulation among search, understanding, and manipulation subtasks. Conclusion: Older users seemed to have difficulty in all the subtasks of search, recognition, and manipulation. It was suggested that designers of mobile phones need to give careful consideration into designing visual interfaces for search tasks and keypads for easier control and input for the elderly users.

This is being achieved by making expeditious attempts to provide online public sector products and services on a nationwide basis. However, there are certain regions and groups of the populace in a country where this aim will not be achieved. Aims to focus on this.   Design/methodology/approach Using two comparative case studies and a combination of qualitative and quantitative data, this research identifies the challenges being faced by the UK government in ensuring e‐government products and services to both the rural and urban areas. The London Borough of Hillingdon is used to illustrate the case of the urban area, whilst Conwy County Borough Council is the rural case.   Findings The research found that while citizens' backgrounds influenced accessibility to e‐government services in the urban area, geographic location related issues were posing problems to the same in the rural area.   Practical implications While illustrating a digital divide, this implies that the UK government still has challenges to overcome, as it has to obtain and convince the citizens to attain internet access that will allow them to acquire the online products and services offered by the government. Amongst other challenges to be encountered are how to overcome the organisational and technical issues that could impede the desired integration of business processes and technologies across government institutions for effective e‐governance.

On that same day, George Lucas formally announced his donation of $175 million to the USC School of Cinematic Arts, formerly known as USC School of Cinema-Television. The reason that George Lucas renamed the world-renowned film school is due to the growing importance of interactive media in Hollywood and worldwide. Computer games have, for many years, captured the attention of Hollywood moguls such as George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. George, Steven, and many supporters of USC have decided that formal education on interactive media and gaming should be given equal priority and funding as traditional movie making and television production. Therefore, instead of appending ""Interactive Media"" to ""Cinema- Television,"" the USC school simply changed its name to ""Cinematic Arts."" The implication for interactive entertainment cannot be understated. George Lucas has essentially proclaimed that interactive media and gaming are a part of cinematic arts. Will there be a George Lucas or Steven Spielberg-like genius in next-generation interactive entertainment that will win an Oscar? You bet there will be in the near future. In the video interview, you will hear George Lucas' answers to the following questions as well as his comments at the USC School of Cinematic Arts on October 4th: 1. Is your educational foundation ""edutopia"" doing anything about the digital divide, especially in terms of access to interactive entertainment? 2. One of the themes in all of your movies is human relationship to machines and technology - either controlling them, or being controlled by them. Is that true? 3.

Design/methodology/approach The approach adopted was to review the development challenges of developing countries, the in‐trends information handling and the transition from information to knowledge management systems. The next approach was to examine statistically, the internet usage status and information and communication technology facilities in Africa. Based on the data provided and discussed the final approach was to draw up critical roles for developing countries' librarians in the knowledge age.   Findings The findings indicate the abysmal state of internet usage and ICT facilities in Africa in particular and the rest of the developing countries in general.   Research limitations/implications Librarians will be called upon to provide authentic and reliable information, evolve strategic alliances, participate in network activities and contribute to the bridging of the digital divide. They will emerge as technology experts, guides, scouts, researchers, analysts, knowledge engineers, editors, navigators, gatekeepers, brokers and asset managers. Conclusively, librarians will need to acquire new skills to access net resources, and develop new strategies and services to meet the challenges of the knowledge age.   Originality/value The results and discussions imply that it is critically important for information professionals from developing countries to begin to re‐evaluate their roles in terms of how they contribute to the management of technology and information in the knowledge age. They must participate in information and knowledge creation, undertake information resources documentation, provide an information identification service and evolve new means of resource preservation.",The Electronic Library,2006,24,6,847-863,"Omekwu, Charles Obiora",University of Lagos,Nigeria,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019755756,18,"[Sabaratnam, Julie S.]|[]|IFLA Journal|1997|23|3|197-202|10.1177/034003529702300307|pub.1001606429|3;[Zhang, Allison]|[]|Digital Library Perspectives|2000|16|3|107-117|10.1108/10650750010345247|pub.1035365222|3;[Oluić‐Vuković, Vesna]|[ur.07650623433.31]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2000|52|1|54-61|10.1002/1532-2890(2000)52:1<54::aid-asi1058>3.0.co;2-0|pub.1035693319|10;[Omekwu, Charles O.]|[ur.012070724765.34]|Library Review|2003|52|9|444-451|10.1108/00242530310501464|pub.1037400659|3;[Omekwu, Charles O]|[ur.012070724765.34]|Information Technologist (The)|2005|1|1||10.4314/ict.v1i1.31944|pub.1072480932|2"
pub.1009293046,10.1108/13673270910988178,Beyond the digital divide: policy analysis for knowledge societies,"The purpose of this paper is to report the results of using the framework in the field for the purpose of formulating knowledge policies. The framework derives from a conceptual model for analyzing knowledge development overviewed by the authors in a previous paper. The paper uses the conceptual framework of 13 dimensions for knowledge policy‐making analysis and qualitative focus group discussions by means of what is known as a knowledge SWOT analysis. Such an exercise ordinarily determines what is termed as net strength (strengths offset by weaknesses) and net opportunity (opportunities offset by threats). The field research suggests that, whereas quantitative indicators are very commonly used for the purpose of benchmarking and progress tracking, they are limited in terms of determining causes, effects and encapsulating good practices. The present framework provides a means for policy‐makers and analysts to engage in discussion, debates, story‐telling and scenario building in order to understand net strengths and opportunities. The research is limited by the time constraints of the focus group participants and it is not feasible to conduct a K‐SWOT of more than the four societies used for the reason that there are insufficient numbers of informed participants. Developing the knowledge economy has to be more than a management of socio‐economic indicators. Understanding the net strength and opportunity faced by a society in the context of a global knowledge economy allowed insights into gaps that may be addressed with appropriate knowledge policies. There is much work to be done in formulating implementable policy recommendations. It is hoped that a useful and valid policy analysis tool for knowledge development has thus been described.",Journal of Knowledge Management,2009,13,5,373-386,"Sharma, Ravi S.; Samuel, Ekundayo M.; Ng, Elaine W.J.",Nanyang Technological University,Singapore,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009293046,19,"[*, Mark Olssen; Peters, Michael A.]|[; ur.011070424313.29]|Journal of Education Policy|2005|20|3|313-345|10.1080/02680930500108718|pub.1001221463|1316;[Nonaka, Ikujiro; Toyama, Ryoko; Konno, Noboru]|[ur.013013635042.04; ur.010334000545.54; ur.011005326001.77]|Long Range Planning|2000|33|1|5-34|10.1016/s0024-6301(99)00115-6|pub.1002546237|2007;[Mansell, Robin]|[ur.013665171232.89]|Current Sociology|2002|50|3|407-426|10.1177/0011392102050003007|pub.1004956599|130;[Dvir, Ron; Pasher, Edna]|[ur.07627446477.44; ur.014465232373.09]|Journal of Knowledge Management|2004|8|5|16-27|10.1108/13673270410558756|pub.1015476742|131;[Baqir, Muhammad Naveed; Kathawala, Yunus]|[ur.012662530762.28; ur.0753453372.67]|Journal of Knowledge Management|2004|8|5|83-95|10.1108/13673270410558828|pub.1015774149|32;[Sharma, Ravi S.; Ng, Elaine W.J.; Dharmawirya, Mathias; Lee, Chu Keong]|[ur.015610614103.55; ur.012040523411.45; ur.013325011661.43; ]|Journal of Knowledge Management|2008|12|5|151-164|10.1108/13673270810903000|pub.1015917881|25;[Carrillo, Francisco J.]|[]|Journal of Knowledge Management|2004|8|5|28-46|10.1108/1367327041058738|pub.1018997850|113;[Quéau, Philippe]|[]|Development|2002|45|4|10-16|10.1057/palgrave.development.1110398|pub.1019540397|16;[Stajkovic, Alexander D.; Luthans, Fred]|[ur.0754103271.40; ur.064066406.33]|Organizational Dynamics|1998|26|4|62-74|10.1016/s0090-2616(98)90006-7|pub.1021233032|390;[Ergazakis, Kostas; Metaxiotis, Kostas; Psarras, John]|[ur.013042155213.53; ur.012601227167.20; ur.015300614545.60]|Knowledge Management Research & Practice|2006|4|1|46-59|10.1057/palgrave.kmrp.8500089|pub.1022353887|25;[Powell, Walter W.; Snellman, Kaisa]|[ur.014223124105.11; ur.01106040032.79]|Annual Review of Sociology|2004|30|1|199-220|10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100037|pub.1025038191|848;[Zack, Michael H.]|[]|California Management Review|1999|41|3|125-145|10.2307/41166000|pub.1025636514|1045;[Kellerman, Aharon]|[ur.015576577161.13]|Info|2000|2|6|537-541|10.1108/14636690010801708|pub.1027020973|6;[Edvinsson, Leif]|[ur.016556325333.66]|International Handbooks on Information Systems|2004|||153-163|10.1007/978-3-540-24746-3_8|pub.1030801884|13;[Gupta, Anil K.; Govindarajan, Vijay]|[ur.012466336413.16; ur.01141654407.18]|Strategic Management Journal|2000|21|4|473-496|10.1002/(sici)1097-0266(200004)21:4<473::aid-smj84>3.0.co;2-i|pub.1034423327|2298;[Cheng, Philip; Choi, Chong Ju; Chen, Stephen; Eldomiaty, Tarek Ibrahim; Millar, Carla C.J.M.]|[ur.010262104775.50; ur.016612234361.49; ur.015217273361.62; ur.012733623567.46; ur.016513401417.31]|Journal of Knowledge Management|2004|8|5|96-106|10.1108/13673270410558800|pub.1040609096|22;[Harris, Richard G.]|[]|International Journal of Management Reviews|2001|3|1|21-40|10.1111/1468-2370.00052|pub.1044177967|127;[Hearn, Greg; Rooney, David]|[ur.012305501037.61; ur.012001600321.41]|Foresight|2002|4|6|23-33|10.1108/14636680210453461|pub.1044722790|13;[Edvinsson, Leif]|[]|Journal of Intellectual Capital|2000|1|1|12-16|10.1108/14691930010371618|pub.1052371630|98;[Chou, Shih-Wei]|[ur.013101660453.89]|Journal of Information Science|2005|31|6|453-465|10.1177/0165551505057005|pub.1063751013|54;[Hochwarter, Wayne A.; Kiewitz, Christian; Gundlach, Michael J.; Stoner, Jason]|[ur.016130552217.63; ur.01310150712.90; ur.011344410643.26; ur.010623012567.98]|Journal of Leadership & Organizational Studies|2004|10|3|27-40|10.1177/107179190401000303|pub.1063953630|23"
pub.1095667073,10.1109/ipcc.2005.1494194,Manuals for the Elderly: Text Characteristics that Help or Hinder Older Users,"The elderly seem to encounter more problems than most other users when operating modern devices and processing the accompanying instructions. In a rapidly greying society and a growing grey digital divide, it is useful to investigate how instructions can be optimized to meet the needs of elderly users and to make modern technology more accessible to the elderly. In this research project we have looked at differences between age groups, at effects of textual variants and at interactions between these factors. An exploratory investigation indicated that in instructions iconicity, the signaling of steps and the presence of goal and consequence information affect older people's task performance. This article reports three experiments, which investigated these factors more thoroughly. All three experiments included an older and a younger age group. In all three experiments age effects were found: the elderly needed more time and made more errors than the younger participants. In experiment one, iconicity and different types of signaling were investigated. Participants were exposed to simulations of procedures, which they had to judge on correctness. Unexpectedly, neither of the age groups was affected by the text variants. Experiment two investigated iconicity in more detail. Participants performed iconic and non-iconic instructions. Iconicity turned out to have an effect, and there was an interaction with age, but the results were opposite to what was expected. In the third experiment, effects of goal and consequence information were investigated. Participants performed instructions in which goal or consequence information was present or absent. In this experiment, the absence of consequence information hampered task performance in the older age group.","IPCC 2005. Proceedings.

Design/methodology/approach An exploratory approach combining quantitative and qualitative methods. A questionnaire survey was distributed to all HEFCE‐funded institutions in the UK. Six institutions acted as case study sites for in‐depth qualitative investigation using documentary analysis and semi‐structured interviews.   Findings Lack of hardware and network infrastructure posed less of a barrier than lack of ICT skills, lack of motivation either to use computers or to gain ICT skills, and line manager resistance to staff using computers or accessing ICT training in work time. Job function was the factor most associated with lack of access, with cleaning, catering and estates staff least likely to have access. However, there were also many examples of good practice to extend staff access, particularly with regard to ICT training. The research concludes that one of the main concerns for institutions is to “win the hearts and minds” of non‐desk staff and their managers. The development of an institutional communication strategy is identified as being of critical importance.   Research limitations/implications Provides a “snapshot” of the prevailing situation at the point of data collection rather than a longitudinal insight into developments in access over time.

The introduction briefly examines the impact of ICTs on society and calls for alternative channels for government to serve rural communities through the use of Multi-Community Access Centres (MCACs) or information kiosks available at libraries, police stations, tourist information centres and post offices, as an e-governance initiative in the creation of “smart communities” and as a grassroots effort. No analysis of ICTs on government's functions would be complete if we did not address the growing debate on the digital divide. In this paper a section is devoted to this and it summarily addresses the growing divide between the developed and the developing world and the potential of these islands to leap–frog barriers to information flows and access. The heart of the paper examines the impact of the Internet on small island economies and the growing use of the Internet in key sectors of each economy. Since this paper is about governments’ use of ICTs to transfer business transactions onto the Internet to service their populace, some discussion is undertaken and considers ways in which innovation has impacted on governments’ services and the early attempts by some Caribbean administrations to implement e-governance. E-Voices illustrates how certain government measures affect some vulnerable groups in society and ways in which they can broker power to participate in the process.

The resulting digital divide has hitherto left these countries far behind other regions of the world in various aspects of economic development. Many technology-oriented constraints account for the low levels of teledensity in Africa. Teledensity refers to the number of main telephone lines per one hundred inhabitants. The over-dependence of Africa's LDCs on the West has been reflected in various socio-economic dimensions, including the telecommunications industry. A general desire by the LDCs to break the cycle of perpetual dependence has led to calls for a debate on what strategies can be adopted to turn things around. Possible options include the following: (a) self-sufficiency approach by each country, (b) African Regional/Foreign Alliance approach to solve the regional technology- oriented constraints to teledensity, and (c) the 'viagra' approach of total and perpetual dependence on the West to come in and apply a ""band-aid"" fix to the problem, and leave behind an infrastructure with little or no local expertise to manage it. In this paper, the term 'viagra' is used to imply a quick or ""band-aid"" prescription in the guise of a ""solution "". This study examines the perspectives or beliefs of telecommunications stakeholders of Africa's LDCs on strategies for solving the technology-oriented constraints that have been documented in the literature. The findings suggest that Africa's LDCs should adopt a self-sufficiency approach and also create regional alliances for sustainable development of telecommunications infrastructure to spur the much needed teledensity growth in the region",Journal of Global Information Technology Management,2002,5,1,25-42,"Mbarika, Victor W.; Musa, Philip F.; Byrd, Terry Anthony; McMullen, Patrick",Louisiana State University; University of Alabama at Birmingham; Auburn University,United States; United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028980426,14,"[Hardy, Andrew P.]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1980|4|4|278-286|10.1016/0308-5961(80)90044-0|pub.1003695597|271;[Zhang, Yin]|[]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2000|51|1|57-68|10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(2000)51:1<57::aid-asi9>3.0.co;2-w|pub.1018200501|126;[Mbarika, Victor W.; Byrd, Terry Anthony; Raymond, Jennie E.; McMullen, Patrick]|[ur.010076557303.64; ur.010406565231.41; ur.013134055043.57; ur.013744167643.61]|The International Journal on Media Management|2000|2|3-4|133-142|10.1080/14241270009389932|pub.1025941457|10;[Robinson, John P.; Shaver, Phillip R.; Wrightsman, Lawrence S.]|[ur.011553235065.99; ur.0700323406.77; ur.07474216762.17]|Measures of Personality and Social Psychological Attitudes|1991|||1-16|10.1016/b978-0-12-590241-0.50005-8|pub.1052630276|705;[Parapak, J.L.]|[]|IEEE Communications Magazine|1994|32|11|40-41|10.1109/35.330222|pub.1061158990|3;[Peter, J.

pub.1015917881,10.1108/13673270810903000,Beyond the digital divide: a conceptual framework for analyzing knowledge societies,"Purpose  The research reported in this ongoing study aims to investigate the notion of knowledge assets developed within digital communities in the course of their economic or leisure activities. Ideally, the resulting knowledge is universal, affordable and relevant; this inclusiveness is a hallmark of any information or knowledge society.    Design/methodology/approach  The authors first synthesize the related research literature covering the areas of knowledge‐based economies, knowledge societies and knowledge policies. A model using 13 dimensions is then developed, which the authors claim is critical for creating a knowledge community in the digital economy. The model is validated against critique from a Delphi panel of researchers in the area.    Findings   While creating a knowledge society encompasses dimensions pertaining to infrastructure, governance, talent and culture, intangible assets are key to sustaining such societies. Governance and culture are instances of such intangibles. Talent may seem to be tangible but the human capacity for learning and development, which leads to an innovative culture, is less so. In any case, time is the essential ingredient for a knowledge culture to come about.     Research limitations/implications  Knowledge societies are not measurable constructs that can be described quantitatively and benchmarked with weighted summations of scores along prescribed dimensions. It would be a fallacy to treat the notion of a knowledge index as a socio‐economic measure of success.    Practical implications  . conclude with a practical view of how the dimensions may be best exploited in the course of a policy discussion on sustainable knowledge societies.    Originality/value  It is hoped that the research will provide a framework for policy makers and analysts to conduct qualitative discussions on creating and sustaining knowledge societies.",Journal of Knowledge Management,2008,12,5,151-164,"Sharma, Ravi S.; Ng, Elaine W.J.; Dharmawirya, Mathias; Lee, Chu Keong",Nanyang Technological University,Singapore,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015917881,25,"[*, Mark Olssen; Peters, Michael A.]|[; ur.011070424313.29]|Journal of Education Policy|2005|20|3|313-345|10.1080/02680930500108718|pub.1001221463|1316;[Nonaka, Ikujiro; Toyama, Ryoko; Konno, Noboru]|[ur.013013635042.04; ur.010334000545.54; ur.011005326001.77]|Long Range Planning|2000|33|1|5-34|10.1016/s0024-6301(99)00115-6|pub.1002546237|2007;[Mansell, Robin]|[ur.013665171232.89]|Current Sociology|2002|50|3|407-426|10.1177/0011392102050003007|pub.1004956599|130;[]|[]|European Policies for a Knowledge Economy|2003||||10.4337/9781781950432|pub.1010867279|43;[Dvir, Ron; Pasher, Edna]|[ur.07627446477.44; ur.014465232373.09]|Journal of Knowledge Management|2004|8|5|16-27|10.1108/13673270410558756|pub.1015476742|131;[Baqir, Muhammad Naveed; Kathawala, Yunus]|[ur.012662530762.28; ur.0753453372.67]|Journal of Knowledge Management|2004|8|5|83-95|10.1108/13673270410558828|pub.1015774149|32;[Sagasti, Francisco]|[]||2004||||10.4337/9781843769804|pub.1015905409|23;[Ergazakis, Kostas; Metaxiotis, Kostas; Psarras, John]|[ur.013042155213.53; ur.012601227167.20; ur.015300614545.60]|Knowledge Management Research & Practice|2006|4|1|46-59|10.1057/palgrave.kmrp.8500089|pub.1022353887|25;[Powell, Walter W.; Snellman, Kaisa]|[ur.014223124105.11; ur.01106040032.79]|Annual Review of Sociology|2004|30|1|199-220|10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100037|pub.1025038191|848;[Connelly, Catherine E.; Kelloway, E.

pub.1044479591,10.1016/j.intcom.2010.10.004,Surfing the web – Recreation or resource? Exploring how young people in the UK use the Internet as an advice portal for problems with a legal dimension,"Internet use and access in the UK has increased rapidly in the last decade, with the concept of ‘information superhighway’ recognised as an axiom of Internet technology. Despite this, few studies have sought to investigate the incidence of use of the Internet as an advice resource outside of the health information arena. With an increasing impetus in the public sector towards the provision of online delivery mechanisms for civic orientated activities, including advice provision, it is timely to better understand the appropriateness of online advice seeking. Focusing on young people aged between 18 and 24years, we investigated how much the Internet was used to obtain information about everyday problems with a legal dimension, who used it, how it was used and how successful respondents were in searching for information online. Data were extracted from a large-scale household survey of adults’ experience of problems with a legal dimension conducted across England and Wales (10,512 adult respondents). Results revealed significant growth in the use of the Internet to obtain information about such problems, rising from 4% in 2001 to around 18% in 2008. The responses of the 18–24year olds to the survey illustrated that despite having comparatively high levels of Internet access, this age group utilised it to a lesser degree than similarly ‘connected’ age cohorts, and were less successful when doing so. This study highlights aspects of the second digital divide, going beyond access to explore use and outcomes of use. Implications for the future of the Internet in providing information and advice for young people, are discussed.",Interacting with Computers,2011,23,1,96-104,"Denvir, Catrina; Balmer, Nigel J.; Pleasence, Pascoe",University College London,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1044479591,12,"[Bennett, Sue; Maton, Karl; Kervin, Lisa]|[ur.016226000167.84; ur.013434101224.60; ur.016005563305.54]|British Journal of Educational Technology|2008|39|5|775-786|10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00793.x|pub.1002803578|1418;[Dinet, Jérôme; Favart, Monik; Passerault, Jean‐Michel]|[ur.015542211642.19; ur.01041420404.01; ur.013551407515.84]|Journal of Computer Assisted Learning|2004|20|5|338-346|10.1111/j.1365-2729.2004.00093.x|pub.1008138698|28;[Sillence, Elizabeth; Briggs, Pam; Harris, Peter; Fishwick, Lesley]|[ur.0643675121.61; ur.01011637265.51; ur.01126760775.73; ur.012733162376.54]|Interacting with Computers|2007|19|3|397-406|10.1016/j.intcom.2006.10.002|pub.1008175525|94;[Tylee, Andre; Haller, Dagmar M; Graham, Tanya; Churchill, Rachel; Sanci, Lena A]|[ur.01042045070.28; ur.014043754622.69; ur.01072000021.64; ur.01334403165.26; ur.01266055356.05]|The Lancet|2007|369|9572|1565-1573|10.1016/s0140-6736(07)60371-7|pub.1011033207|455;[Eysenbach, Gunther; Köhler, Christian]|[ur.015744165545.08; ur.0611517375.26]|The BMJ|2002|324|7337|573|10.1136/bmj.324.7337.573|pub.1011727692|1314;[Nicholas, David; Huntington, Paul; Gunter, Barrie; Withey, Richard; Russell, Chris]|[ur.011274653015.81; ur.0700306724.27; ur.0746422124.33; ur.010732156607.76; ur.010134576207.33]|Aslib Journal of Information Management|2003|55|5/6|261-276|10.1108/00012530310498842|pub.1015308819|56;[Bilal, Dania]|[ur.011507771634.99]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2002|53|13|1170-1183|10.1002/asi.10145|pub.1015378554|134;[Cheong, Pauline Hope]|[ur.010350772355.00]|New Media & Society|2008|10|5|771-791|10.1177/1461444808094356|pub.1017805728|35;[Borzekowski, D L; Rickert, V I]|[ur.01035376765.16; ur.0775007217.40]|JAMA Pediatrics|2001|155|7|813-817|10.1001/archpedi.155.7.813|pub.1019406948|267;[Sillence, Elizabeth; Briggs, Pam]|[ur.0643675121.61; ur.01011637265.51]|Computers in Human Behavior|2007|23|1|727-748|10.1016/j.chb.2004.11.006|pub.1021874112|28;[Cheong, Pauline Hope]|[ur.010350772355.00]|Women's Studies in Communication|2007|30|2|205-228|10.1080/07491409.2007.10162513|pub.1028304173|25;[Puustinen, Minna; Rouet, Jean-François]|[ur.011000667657.17; ur.01261576173.15]|Computers & Education|2009|53|4|1014-1019|10.1016/j.compedu.2008.07.002|pub.1043944673|82;[Buck, Alexy]|[]|Zeitschrift für Rechtssoziologie|2007|28|2|165-178|10.1515/zfrs-2007-0206|pub.1045040427|4;[Howard, P.E.N.; Rainie, L.; Jones, S.]|[; ur.013223520340.72; ur.015414041740.33]|American Behavioral Scientist|2001|45|3|383-404|10.1177/00027640121957259|pub.1063544514|265;[Skinner, Harvey; Biscope, Sherry; Poland, Blake; Goldberg, Eudice]|[ur.01032252571.08; ur.01120410346.51; ur.0770647626.49; ur.0633267447.81]|Journal of Medical Internet Research|2003|5|4|e32|10.2196/jmir.5.4.e32|pub.1069286391|267;[Attewell, Paul]|[]|Sociology of Education|2001|74|3|252|10.2307/2673277|pub.1070053429|290"
pub.1034976823,10.1108/00251740510603628,Management of infrastructures,"Purpose The aim of this paper is to compare the railway and internet revolutions. What do they have in common and what is different between them, considering the 150‐year time difference in their occurrence? As time passes, can internet developers learn something from the railway industry?   Findings The two industries have a lot of common. Both railways and the internet represent national infrastructures that cannot be managed just based on business management principles. As both are concerned with traffic, either that of physical goods or of messages, the two industries also seem to have a lot in technical terms when one takes a sufficiently abstract point of view. The main message is that in the long term, the railway revolution vanished and the industry turned into a low profit/interest field. The internet might follow the same path.   Research limitations/implications The paper in its current form is based on a literature review only. Its quality could be improved with a detailed empirical study. Other similar infrastructure‐type industries could also be involved.   Practical implications There are several things that could be improved in the management of the internet, but they are large‐scale issues needing co‐operation between the many stakeholders in the internet. Examples are those of avoiding the digital divide and catering for critical “last mile” connections, as well as managing the diversity of different standards.   Originality/value As far as the author knows this is the first paper of its kind comparing these two industries. The message is that more cross‐industrial studies need to be performed.

pub.1009837557,10.1108/14779961011024837,A human environmentalist approach to diffusion in ICT policies,"Purpose Through an evaluation of the information technology (IT) adoption and diffusion models and the free and/or open source policy of the South African Government, the underlying assumption is that the developmental divide between those with and those without access to technology is purely technical. This paper aims to illustrate that if Free and/or Open Source Software is to be used as a building block to bridge the “digital divide” a more social and environmental perspective, which embraces the philosophy behind the software, needs to complement the technical perspective. The human environmental model is presented as a useful alternative which, if embraced, can inform more holistic information and communication technology (ICT) policies.   Design/methodology/approach Through a review of diffusion of innovations models an alternative diffusion framework is described and applied to an interpretive open source case study in South Africa.   Findings Contemporary diffusion and innovation models are narrowly focused on IT as a purely technological linear phenomenon. This perspective also underlies many ICT policies. A more socio‐technical adoption model can assist in providing a more holistic approach to ICT policy development.   Originality/value The application of a new innovation model, the human environmental model, to ICT policy provides a holistic framework in which the complexity of the innovation process can be reflected in policy. Such an approach to ICT policy formulation will assist with broadening the perspective of policy makers from IT as a technical solution to IT as part of a socio‐technical solution and recognise the duality of the innovation process.",Journal of Information Communication and Ethics in Society,2010,8,1,108-123,"Weilbach, Lizette; Byrne, Elaine",University of Pretoria; Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland,South Africa; Ireland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009837557,7,"[Walsham, Geoff; Sahay, Sundeep]|[ur.012623025165.11; ur.012234426741.58]|Information Technology for Development|2006|12|1|7-24|10.1002/itdj.20020|pub.1001019163|291;[Byrne, Elaine; Weilbach, Lizette]|[ur.01342216705.48; ur.014045021027.66]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2008|282||209-222|10.1007/978-0-387-84822-8_14|pub.1007473163|2;[Walsham, G]|[ur.012623025165.11]|European Journal of Information Systems|1995|4|2|74-81|10.1057/ejis.1995.9|pub.1018134921|1749;[Flyvbjerg, Bent]|[ur.015560327303.38]|Qualitative Inquiry|2006|12|2|219-245|10.1177/1077800405284363|pub.1023329272|5918;[Avgerou, Chrisanthi]|[ur.012304503075.13]|Information Systems Journal|2001|11|1|43-63|10.1046/j.1365-2575.2001.00095.x|pub.1031911883|216;[Bayer, Judy; Melone, Nancy]|[ur.011737065761.53; ur.012075166051.90]|Journal of Systems and Software|1989|9|2|161-166|10.1016/0164-1212(89)90018-6|pub.1032517588|53;[Ruddin, Lee Peter]|[ur.07524365745.57]|Qualitative Inquiry|2006|12|4|797-812|10.1177/1077800406288622|pub.1036228730|117;[Prescott, Mary B.; Conger, Sue A.]|[ur.014330606134.38; ur.015422237541.35]|ACM SIGMIS Database the DATABASE for Advances in Information Systems|1995|26|2-3|20-41|10.1145/217278.217284|pub.1036280990|184;[Sahay, S.; Palit, M.; Robey, D.]|[ur.012234426741.58; ; ur.013773673763.76]|European Journal of Information Systems|1994|3|4|248-258|10.1057/ejis.1994.30|pub.1039359352|20;[Jensen, Jason L.; Rodgers, Robert]|[ur.011430330331.82; ur.013152373571.97]|Public Administration Review|2001|61|2|235-246|10.1111/0033-3352.00025|pub.1042588222|164;[Lee, Allen S.; Baskerville, Richard L.]|[ur.015734003331.26; ur.014211036615.49]|Information Systems Research|2003|14|3|221-243|10.1287/isre.14.3.221.16560|pub.1064711692|774;[Moore, Gary C.; Benbasat, Izak]|[; ur.0745713632.15]|Information Systems Research|1991|2|3|192-222|10.1287/isre.2.3.192|pub.1064711710|4532;[Orlikowski, Wanda J.]|[ur.016151230031.17]|Organization Science|2000|11|4|404-428|10.1287/orsc.11.4.404.14600|pub.1064732631|2405;[Boisot, Max]|[]|IN3 Working Paper Series|2004||4||10.7238/in3wps.v0i4.869|pub.1090979319|5"

Similarly, new ‘knowledge management approaches involving such concepts as ‘community of practice’ and ‘individual tacit knowledge’ are related aspirations for capacity‐building on both sides of the so‐called digital divide between rural or developing areas and modern progressive cities and countries. Common to both informal and formal learning models on one hand, and community and enterprise development is an alternately theoretical and informal assumption of “knowledge‐building” which is often contradicted or frustrated in practice because of the difficulty in effectively reconciling or connecting top‐down imperatives and bottom‐up aspects of the local context. In other words, there are some common aspects of (and lessons in) the struggle by educators to effectively integrate ICTs to enhance education on one hand, with achieving sustainable capacity‐building in ICT‐related community development projects and enterprise development initiatives on the other. This paper outlines a framework for better recognizing and engaging with similar and convergent “missing links” in the areas of education and development that have to do with the learning process, cultural change, and new conceptions of both individual and community knowledge. With particular reference to an Asia‐Pacific context, it argues for a kind of ‘dialogical’ approach that is needed in the 21st Century or digital age to better organize, manage, and apply the alternately tacit or informal and explicit connections between human knowledge as both ideas and practice.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2007,32,1,1-11,"Richards, Cameron; Nair, Govindan",University of Western Australia; World Bank,Australia; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099634551,6,"[Rosenberg, Marc J.; Foshay, Rob]|[; ]|Performance Improvement|2002|41|5|50-51|10.1002/pfi.4140410512|pub.1014515148|420;[*, Cameron Richards]|[]|Globalisation Societies and Education|2004|2|3|337-353|10.1080/1476772042000252470|pub.1026867997|41;[Wenger, Etienne]|[]||1998||||10.1017/cbo9780511803932|pub.1098702110|17834"

Inherently, virtual organizations arouse concerns about security and trustworthiness. Those with an E-customer focus further exacerbate the demands and requirements for trustworthy environments. Trust in virtual organizations is a poignant and timely issue in organizational science and the management of information systems. In the last decade, the topic of trust and virtual teams has been the subject of a scarce and rapidly expanding body of literature, which intersects Human Research Development, HRD, and Management of Information Systems, MIS. (Nandhakumar & Baskerville, 2001; Ishaya and Macauley, 2000; Galvin, 2000; Hugli, 2000, Jarvenpaa, Knoll and Leidner, 1998; Jarvenpaa and Leidner, 1998; Iacona and Weisband, 1997; Meyerson, Weick and Kramer, 1996).Entering the 21st century, the velocity of organizational change driven by IT advancements and globalization was already ferocious. However, in the last six months since 9–11, major budget cuts, drastic travel restrictions and sudden geographic distribution have become the norm in many organization to cope with the dire circumstances brought about by the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001 in the United States.

Notably IFIP working group 8.5 (Information Systems in Public Administration) IFIP working group 6.11 (Communication, Information and Security Aspects of E-Business, E-services and E-society) and the CSI SIG on E-Governance (Computer Society of India Special Interest Group on E-Governance) joined forces with the Program Co-chairs to make this stream of the IFIP World Computer Congress indeed outstanding and challenging. At this event, contributions with perspectives from researchers, practitioners and policymakers were presented. Looking at these three angles has led to new perspectives and a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities that come with developing and implementing e-government services and applications. With this new area of IT applications, there is a great need to share good practices across different parts of the world - the developed world and the emerging economies, the domains of government and business, and also to promote academic and research work to build the theoretical foundations for this field. This field has great potential to improve delivery of services from governments to citizens and interaction between different parts of government and public administration, between government and businesses, and of course between government and citizens.

The IEEE Computer Society pioneered the use of the ICT technology to deliver continuing education to its members at an affordable cost. Through the use of the internet, our members can learn at their leisure basic elements in many popular programming languages, operating systems, data base and network systems and project management, among others. Members have free access to 100 Web-based training courses and in 2004 will have free access to 100 online reference books through our new Online Books program. They can also take a course to study elements of software engineering to help them prepare for an examination that would certify them as a qualified software engineer. The digital library provides practicing engineers and researchers key developments in the entire computing field in the last 15 years. Based on the success in the last five years, the Computer Society plans to expand this service to cover even more ground. Long-term plans include additional certification programs, such as a credential for software project management, and additional tutorials to include more advanced topics. Perhaps even in partnership with universities to facilitate the earning of academic credentials by members. The same technology and data base is accessible worldwide and can be used to help engineers and scientists in the developing countries to acquire new knowledge. With the help and cooperation of organizations such as UNESCO and other similar professional societies, we believe the IEEE Computer Society can play an important role in bridging the digital divide.",IFIP International Federation for Information Processing,2005,161,,123-131,"King, Willis K.",University of Houston,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015192967,0,
pub.1049065423,10.1080/1369118x.2010.543141,NON-ADOPTION OF THE INTERNET IN GREAT BRITAIN AND SWEDEN,"Non-use of the Internet has often been researched within the topic of digital divides. The focus of these studies lay mainly on differences in socio-economic backgrounds and resources. This paper goes one step further by attempting to describe various groups of non-users in two highly developed European countries: Great Britain and Sweden. Results from descriptive analyses, multivariate regressions, and principal components analysis with two waves of comparable data from 2007 and 2009 show a more heterogeneous non-user population in Great Britain and a slightly more homogeneous one in Sweden. Socio-economic factors play a bigger role in influencing who is going online in Britain than in Sweden. Education, occupational status, and household income are significant determinants in both countries. The most important determinants of Internet adoption are age and occupational status. The analysis of a 25–55-year-old sub-sample shows that non-users from this age group feature different socio-economic characteristics from older age groups. Middle-aged British non-users share two specific socio-economic characteristics: low income and unemployment; 25–55-year-old Swedish non-users tend to have low incomes, be unemployed, and be single. Non-users' self-assessment of reasons for non-use do not seem to be consistent with the ‘raw data’. Non-users mainly state that they are not interested in the Internet. Many non-users share sceptical attitudes about the Internet, which influences interest in them.

pub.1022232993,10.1108/14779960580000273,Internet research from a gender perspective Searching for differentiated use patterns,"The current scientific and political discussion on the under‐representation of women within the Internet once again associates women with disinterest in technology in an essentialist manner. Gender‐specific attributions are unquestioningly transferred to the new media, and it is assumed that women behave in unfailing conformity with existing gender stereotypes. The intention of this paper is to show that gender research has to perform differentiated empirical studies of actual Internet use. Gender studies can then make a concrete contribution to the task of overcoming the genderdifferentiated inequalities in the access to and the use of the Internet. I shall begin by briefly outlining the dilemma of gender studies in the technical area. In the second section I shall describe the reasons for the gender‐differentiated Internet access data, using quantitative Internet studies from the USA, calling for a de‐dramatisation of difference in this context. In the third section, I will overcome the dichotomous view of the digital divide and present a research framework for differentiated study of differing use habits and use requirements. This section illustrates that such an approach does not make the gender category superfluous, but challenges gender studies to present context‐related studies, in which individual behaviour may be interpreted in the context of gender symbols and structures. My fourth step will be to explain how the new possibilities of online research can and should be used to gain further understanding in the sense of differentiated study designs. Finally, I will finish with a short outlook where I am calling for an equal representation of all societal groups in the Internet and therefore for an empowerment particularly of women.",Journal of Information Communication and Ethics in Society,2005,3,4,199-207,"Winker, Gabriele",Hamburg University of Technology,Germany,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022232993,4,"[Heimrath, Rosie; Goulding, Anne]|[; ur.010652214421.26]|Program|2001|35|2|119-134|10.1108/eum0000000006944|pub.1007759722|17;[Ono, Hiroshi; Zavodny, Madeline]|[ur.01306451573.22; ur.01076707606.12]|Social Science Quarterly|2003|84|1|111-121|10.1111/1540-6237.t01-1-8401007|pub.1024870490|276;[Hauptmanns, Peter; Lander, Bettina]|[ur.013015521141.29; ur.014755547412.66]|Online-Marktforschung|2001|||27-40|10.1007/978-3-322-99429-5_3|pub.1033841200|15;[SINGH, SUPRIYA]|[]|New Media & Society|2001|3|4|395-415|10.1177/1461444801003004001|pub.1049232539|85;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|First Monday|2002|7|4||10.5210/fm.v7i4.942|pub.1072710742|980;[]|[]|Choice|2002|40|02|40-1165-40-1165|10.5860/choice.40-1165|pub.1073382743|884"

Majority of their population are largely concentrated in the rural areas and access to power is often sporadic or altogether lacking. Without power the traditional telecom infrastructure is impossible. So these lower income strata people are living for years without electricity or telephones, relying on occasional visitors and a sluggish postal system for news of the outside world. So if electricity is playing havoc, there is a need to devise low tech solutions to help bridge not only the digital divide but also the electrical divide. One of such solution is a solar and pedal powered remote ICT system by Inveneo a non-profit organization which combines the power of the computer and a clever application of the increasingly popular Wi-Fi wireless technology powered by solar energy. With this system the rural villagers pedal onto the hand-built, bicycle-powered PC in the village which would send signals, via an IEEE 802.11b connection, to a solar-powered mountaintop relay station. The signal would then bounce to a server in the nearest town with phone service and electricity and from there to the Internet and the world. This paper describes a prototype of how the wireless broadband WiMAX technology can be integrated in to the existing system and gain global possibilities. With the new suggested prototype each village will connect to one WiMAX station through the Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) which is powered by a solar means. The WiMAX tower then send the radio signal to fixed fiber backbone that will connect the villages to the Internet and enables VoIP communications.",Proceedings from the International Conference on Advances in Engineering and Technology,2006,,,635-646,"Santhi, K.R.; Kumaran, G.

pub.1002158772,10.1002/asi.20742,Subjectivity and information ethics1,"In “A Brief History of Information Ethics,” Thomas Froehlich (2004) quickly surveyed under several broad categories some of the many issues that constitute information ethics: under the category of librarianship—censorship, privacy, access, balance in collections, copyright, fair use, and codes of ethics; under information science, which Froehlich sees as closely related to librarianship—confidentiality, bias, and quality of information; under computer ethics—intellectual property, privacy, fair representation, nonmaleficence, computer crime, software reliability, artificial intelligence, and e-commerce; under cyberethics (issues related to the Internet, or “cyberspace”)—expert systems, artificial intelligence (again), and robotics; under media ethics—news, impartiality, journalistic ethics, deceit, lies, sexuality, censorship (again), and violence in the press; and under intercultural information ethics—digital divide, and the ethical role of the Internet for social, political, cultural, and economic development. Many of the debates in information ethics, on these and other issues, have to do with specific kinds of relationships between subjects. The most important subject and a familiar figure in information ethics is the ethical subject engaged in moral deliberation, whether appearing as the bearer of moral rights and obligations to other subjects, or as an agent whose actions are judged, whether by others or by oneself, according to the standards of various moral codes and ethical principles. Many debates in information ethics revolve around conflicts between those acting according to principles of unfettered access to information and those finding some information offensive or harmful. Subjectivity is at the heart of information ethics. But how is subjectivity understood? Can it be understood in ways that broaden ethical reflection to include problems that remain invisible when subjectivity is taken for granted and when how it is created remains unquestioned? This article proposes some answers by investigating the meaning and role of subjectivity in information ethics.†",Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,2007,59,2,267-277,"Frohmann, Bernd",Western University,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002158772,8,"[FROHMANN, BERND]|[ur.013107613775.00]|The International Information & Library Review|2000|32|3-4|423-435|10.1006/iilr.2000.0140|pub.1002198678|5;[Hacking, Ian]|[]||1995||||10.1515/9781400821686|pub.1020954912|950;[Hacking, Ian]|[ur.010434003663.44]|Synthese Library|2002|||583-600|10.1007/978-94-017-0475-5_13|pub.1022121865|629;[Buckland, Michael K.]|[ur.015053723765.67]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|1991|42|5|351-360|10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(199106)42:5<351::aid-asi5>3.0.co;2-3|pub.1033632398|591;[Capurro, Rafael]|[ur.011146063713.51]|Ethics and Information Technology|2006|8|4|175-186|10.1007/s10676-006-9108-0|pub.1039036795|73;[Buckland, Michael K.]|[ur.015053723765.67]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|1997|48|9|804-809|10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(199709)48:9<804::aid-asi5>3.0.co;2-v|pub.1042480907|232;[Weiser, Mark; Brown, John Seely]|[; ]|Beyond Calculation|1997|||75-85|10.1007/978-1-4612-0685-9_6|pub.1052940306|453;[]|[]|European Journal of Communication|2005|20|1|142-143|10.1177/026732310502000116|pub.1063796501|41;[Alder, Ken; Edwards, Paul N.]|[; ]|Journal of American History|1997|84|3|1130|10.2307/2953215|pub.1070146700|27;[]|[]|Choice|1995|33|03|33-1829-33-1829|10.5860/choice.33-1829|pub.1073333549|269;[]|[]|Choice|1999|36|09|36-5352-36-5352|10.5860/choice.36-5352|pub.1073357686|77;[]|[]|Choice|2000|38|02|38-1208-38-1208|10.5860/choice.38-1208|pub.1073368050|617;[]|[]|Choice|2005|42|05|42-3066-42-3066|10.5860/choice.42-3066|pub.1073399573|251;[]|[]|Choice|2005|43|04|43-2283-43-2283|10.5860/choice.43-2283|pub.1073406298|259;[]|[]|Choice|2006|44|03|44-1568-44-1568|10.5860/choice.44-1568|pub.1073413268|83;[Frohmann, Bernd]|[]||2004||||10.3138/9781442673779|pub.1099224016|95;[]|[]||2006||||10.5040/9781472546043|pub.1099374356|776;[Edwards, Paul N.]|[]||1997||||10.7551/mitpress/1871.001.0001|pub.1127683744|186"
pub.1046894895,10.1007/978-3-8349-6872-2_3,"Mobility, Sociability and Creativity in a Networked World","When we began our scholarly association and deep friendship with Professor Wolfgang Fritz, the Internet was a young and evolutionary medium. Because of historical reasons, the United States had longer experience with the Internet – mainly because the U.S. Defense Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA) had laid the foundation for a “survivable electronic network” – but the rest of the world was catching up and progressing fast, especially Europe and particularly Germany. Early successes (Dholakia and Dholakia 1999 [10]; Dholakia, Dholakia, Laub, Hwang and Zwick 2002 [12]), as well as wrenching failures (Pandya and Dholakia 2005a [35], 2005b [36]), with electronic commerce came from the United States. Studies of the world of e-commerce, however, increasingly needed global perspectives. The two authors of this article, and our colleague Norbert Mundorf (also a professor at the University of Rhode Island or URI), found out that Professor Wolfgang Fritz at Technischen Universität Carolo-Wilhelmina zu Braunschweig was already a pioneer on research on the Internet and e-commerce in Germany. This led to significant URI-Braunschweig collaborations that resulted in joint publications in Germany (Fritz 1999 [28], 2001 [29]) as well as in the United States (Dholakia, Fritz, Dholakia and Mundorf 2002 [15]). Authors from or connected to URI made multiple contributions to the Internet Marketing book of Wolfgang Fritz on topics like transformation of markets (Dholakia and Dholakia 1999 [10]; Dholakia, Dholakia, Laub and Hwang 1999 [11]), economic models (Dholakia, Dholakia and Park 1999 [13]; Dholakia, Dholakia, Park and Kshetri 2001 [14]), digital divide (Dholakia 1999 [8]; Dholakia and Kshetri 2001 [16]), and e-commerce (Dholakia, Mundorf and Zwick 1999 [17], 2001 [18]).",Das Internet der Zukunft,2011,,,45-59,"Dholakia, Nikhilesh; Dholakia, Ruby Roy",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046894895,1,"[Dholakia, Ruby Roy; Dholakia, Nikhilesh]|[ur.014004014271.17; ur.013327347110.55]|Telecommunications Policy|1994|18|1|21-31|10.1016/0308-5961(94)90090-6|pub.1006095997|8;[Norberg, Patricia A; Dholakia, Ruby Roy]|[; ur.014004014271.17]|Telematics and Informatics|2004|21|2|143-155|10.1016/s0736-5853(03)00053-4|pub.1009010795|18;[Venkatesh, Alladi]|[ur.013347160614.04]|The Information Superhighway and Private Households|1996|||319-337|10.1007/978-3-642-48423-0_27|pub.1011987449|9;[Kshetri, Nir; Dholakia, Nikhilesh]|[ur.010126432036.35; ur.013327347110.55]|Journal of International Management|2009|15|2|225-239|10.1016/j.intman.2008.09.003|pub.1015845326|32;[Fortin, David R.; Dholakia, Ruby Roy]|[ur.013072541175.75; ur.014004014271.17]|Journal of Business Research|2005|58|3|387-396|10.1016/s0148-2963(03)00106-1|pub.1018678421|365;[Zwick, Detlev; Dholakia, Nikhilesh]|[ur.012236530265.79; ur.013327347110.55]|Journal of Macromarketing|2008|28|4|318-325|10.1177/0276146708325381|pub.1024407831|12;[Dholakia, Ruby Roy; Zhao, Miao]|[ur.014004014271.17; ur.010650500514.23]|International Journal of Retail & Distribution Management|2010|38|7|482-496|10.1108/09590551011052098|pub.1028698752|88;[Zhao, Miao; Dholakia, Ruby Roy]|[ur.010650500514.23; ur.014004014271.17]|Managing Service Quality: An International Journal|2009|19|3|286-307|10.1108/09604520910955311|pub.1031615548|82;[Pandya, Anil; Dholakia, Nikhilesh]|[ur.013143060525.44; ur.013327347110.55]|Journal of Electronic Commerce in Organizations|2005|3|1|1-12|10.4018/jeco.2005010101|pub.1035556776|1;[Zwick, Detlev; Dholakia, Nikhilesh]|[ur.012236530265.79; ur.013327347110.55]|Consumption Markets & Culture|2006|9|1|17-43|10.1080/10253860500481452|pub.1038863777|66;[Dholakia, Nikhilesh; Dholakia, Ruby Roy]|[ur.013327347110.55; ur.014004014271.17]|The Columbia Journal of World Business|1995|30|2|94-104|10.1016/0022-5428(95)90028-4|pub.1040308397|4;[Pandya, Anil M.; Dholakia, Nikhilesh]|[ur.013143060525.44; ur.013327347110.55]|Journal of Electronic Commerce in Organizations|2005|3|2|68-81|10.4018/jeco.2005040105|pub.1041010621|19;[Fortin, David R; Dholakia, Ruby Roy; Dholakia, Nikhilesh]|[ur.013072541175.75; ur.014004014271.17; ur.013327347110.55]|Journal of Business Research|2002|55|8|623-627|10.1016/s0148-2963(00)00202-2|pub.1047978670|14;[Dholakia, Ruby Roy; Zhao, Miao]|[ur.014004014271.17; ur.010650500514.23]|International Journal of Retail & Distribution Management|2009|37|10|821-838|10.1108/09590550910988011|pub.1048387142|39;[Zwick, Detlev; Dholakia, Nikhilesh]|[ur.012236530265.79; ur.013327347110.55]|Marketing Theory|2006|6|1|41-62|10.1177/1470593106061262|pub.1064025451|50"
pub.1046614623,10.1016/s1057-2317(03)00020-1,Empowering Development Through E-Governance: Creating Smart Communities In Small Island States,"An attempt is made in this paper to gain an understanding of the current and potential impact of the new information and communication technologies (ICTs) on the Small Island Sates of the Caribbean, in particular those populations living in rural communities. The introduction briefly examines the impact of ICTs on society and calls for alternative channels for government to serve rural communities through the use of Multi-Community Access Centres (MCACs) or information kiosks available at libraries, police stations, tourist information centres and post offices, as an e-governance initiative in the creation of “smart communities” and as a grassroots effort. No analysis of ICTs on government's functions would be complete if we did not address the growing debate on the digital divide. In this paper a section is devoted to this and it summarily addresses the growing divide between the developed and the developing world and the potential of these islands to leap–frog barriers to information flows and access. The heart of the paper examines the impact of the Internet on small island economies and the growing use of the Internet in key sectors of each economy. Since this paper is about governments’ use of ICTs to transfer business transactions onto the Internet to service their populace, some discussion is undertaken and considers ways in which innovation has impacted on governments’ services and the early attempts by some Caribbean administrations to implement e-governance. E-Voices illustrates how certain government measures affect some vulnerable groups in society and ways in which they can broker power to participate in the process.

pub.1009580280,10.1108/03090591111160788,Financial implications of implementing an e‐learning project,"Purpose This paper aims to outline the financial implications, while deploying information and communication technologies for implementing e‐learning, and to elucidate them, while implementing an e‐learning project in a conventional university environment.   Design/methodology/approach The paper is a descriptive account of the various cost factors and benefits accrued in implementing an e‐learning project and draws on a variety of secondary sources both published and unpublished.   Findings The paper identifies the various cost factors as well as the benefits involved in e‐learning implementation in conventional educational institutions, so that e‐learning implementation is a smooth process. Three modes of e‐learning exist, namely, substantially online mode; replacement mode; and supplemental mode, and the costs of e‐learning vary for each. The paper also describes how to assess the success or failure of an e‐learning project.   Research limitations/implications The paper presents a review of literature developed from secondary sources since e‐learning implementation is in a budding stage in conventional universities, particularly in the Asian context.   Practical implications The paper outlines the financial implications of e‐learning and provides information on the various cost factors in implementing an e‐learning project for the first time. These factors should be duly acknowledged and given consideration, if the advantages of e‐learning are to be fully realised and e‐learning implementation is to succeed.   Originality/value This paper provides a valuable summary of the state of affairs of financial implications, for instance the cost factors and benefits accrued while implementing an e‐learning project in the case of conventional universities. From this summary of the current situation, it goes on to suggest potential ways to transform the “digital divide” into “digital opportunities”.",European Journal of Training and Development,2011,35,7,658-686,"Sharma, Kunal",Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology,India,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009580280,5,"[]|[]|ASHE-ERIC Higher Education Report|2000|27|5|21-40|10.1002/aehe.3640270504|pub.1001331709|3;[Du, Jianxia; Havard, Byron; Li, Heng]|[ur.012134555351.87; ur.01255774503.60; ur.013527516351.42]|Educational Media International|2005|42|3|207-218|10.1080/09523980500161221|pub.1010930849|29;[Bates, A W Tony]|[]||2005||||10.4324/9780203463772|pub.1013005616|339;[Ash, Charlotte; Bacsich, Paul]|[; ur.016233522624.04]|Computer Supported Cooperative Work|2002|||27-48|10.1007/978-1-4471-0181-9_3|pub.1020079497|8;[Ross, John A.; Hogaboam-Gray, Anne; Rolheiser, Carol]|[ur.012444227157.45; ur.0604122672.58; ur.014306752135.56]|Educational Assessment|2002|8|1|43-58|10.1207/s15326977ea0801_03|pub.1044512093|50;[Nicol, David; Coen, Michael]|[; ]|Research in Learning Technology|2003|11|2||10.3402/rlt.v11i2.11276|pub.1071276893|10;[Hawkridge, David]|[]|Research in Learning Technology|2011|6|3||10.3402/rlt.v6i3.11164|pub.1071277424|2;[Brown, Stephen]|[]|Research in Learning Technology|2011|6|3||10.3402/rlt.v6i3.11165|pub.1071277425|5;[Hara, Noriko; Kling, Rob]|[; ]|First Monday|1999|4|12||10.5210/fm.v4i12.710|pub.1072710468|215;[]|[]|Virtual Environments for Teaching and Learning|2002||||10.1142/5102|pub.1098906215|7"
pub.1028377981,10.1080/1369118042000284605,‘Reconnecting’ the Unemployed Information and communication technology and services for jobseekers in rural areas,"This paper discusses the potential uses of the Internet and other forms of information and communication technology (ICT) as a tool for delivering information services for unemployed people, comparing the experiences and attitudes of jobseekers in peri-urban and remote rural labour markets. The analysis is based upon research carried out in two areas: the first combining a remote rural town with a much larger, more sparsely populated, rural ‘travel-to-work area’; the second, a centrally located peri-urban labour market. Survey research undertaken in the study areas gathered responses from 490 unemployed jobseekers. Emerging issues were then followed up during twelve focus groups. The study found that the use of ICT for job seeking remained a marginal activity for most unemployed people, but was much more important in remote rural communities. In these areas, jobseekers were more likely to use the Internet as a search tool and were particularly dependent on telephone helplines provided by the public employment service (PES). However, the study also found that a ‘digital divide’ was evident within the unemployed client group. Those with low educational attainment, the long-term unemployed, young people and those perceiving their ICT skills to be ‘poor’ were less likely to use the Internet. Although respondents in rural areas were more likely to use ICT to look for work, they also pointed to the overriding importance of informal, social networks as a means of sharing job information in remote communities. We conclude that ICT may have a future role in the delivery of services for jobseekers, especially in rural areas. However, policies are required to ensure that information provided through ICT-based services is locally relevant, and disadvantaged groups have access to the facilities and training they require.",Information Communication & Society,2004,7,3,364-388,"McQuaid, Ronald; Lindsay, Colin; Greig, Malcolm",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028377981,23,"[Liff, Sonia; Steward, Fred]|[ur.015432352362.07; ur.07710634033.98]|Information Communication & Society|2001|4|3|317-340|10.1080/713768550|pub.1000746199|17;[Servaes, Jan; Heinderyckx, Francois]|[ur.010751772465.57; ur.012733526033.47]|Telematics and Informatics|2002|19|2|91-115|10.1016/s0736-5853(01)00008-9|pub.1002551163|19;[Mansell, Robin]|[ur.013665171232.89]|Current Sociology|2002|50|3|407-426|10.1177/0011392102050003007|pub.1004956599|130;[Burrows, Roger; Nettleton, Sarah; Pleace, Nicholas; Loader, Brian; Muncer, Steven]|[ur.01273352061.20; ur.01367521004.09; ur.01255535170.75; ur.07466121066.46; ur.01270020704.21]|Information Communication & Society|2000|3|1|95-121|10.1080/136911800359446|pub.1008163839|136;[Devins, David; Darlow, Alison; Smith, Vikki]|[ur.015323153775.54; ur.015035161505.02; ur.011243517747.40]|Regional Studies|2002|36|8|941-945|10.1080/0034340022000012360|pub.1009534134|14;[Lindsay, Colin; McCracken, Martin; McQuaid, Ronald W.]|[ur.013235004557.97; ur.07646226343.56; ur.010521665531.52]|Journal of Rural Studies|2003|19|2|187-200|10.1016/s0743-0167(02)00067-0|pub.1009578650|43;[Carter, Chris; Grieco, Margaret]|[; ur.010706615761.80]|Urban Studies|2000|37|10|1735-1748|10.1080/00420980020080361|pub.1009715424|30;[Graham, Stephen]|[]|Urban Studies|2002|39|1|33-56|10.1080/00420980220099050|pub.1010968716|244;[Haddon, Leslie]|[ur.014203031645.98]|New Media & Society|2000|2|4|387-406|10.1177/1461444800002004001|pub.1024226259|84;[Phipps, Linda]|[]|Information Communication & Society|2000|3|1|39-68|10.1080/136911800359419|pub.1026431128|62;[Servon, Lisa J.; Nelson, Marla K.]|[ur.012235551203.08; ur.014320504531.98]|International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|2001|25|2|419-426|10.1111/1468-2427.00320|pub.1030496710|13;[SELWYN, NEIL]|[ur.010274414500.72]|Journal of Social Policy|2002|31|1|1-20|10.1017/s0047279402006487|pub.1035487375|74;[Borgida, Eugene; Sullivan, John L.; Oxendine, Alina; Jackson, Melinda S.; Riedel, Eric; Gangl, Amy]|[ur.016617635476.55; ur.012513746555.18; ur.015362674227.81; ur.016205057705.44; ur.014126235723.73; ur.016316557323.21]|Journal of Social Issues|2002|58|1|125-141|10.1111/1540-4560.00252|pub.1048479053|54;[Loader, Brian D.; Muncer, Steve; Burrows, Roger; Pleace, Nicholas; Nettleton, Sara]|[ur.07466121066.46; ur.010431176324.05; ur.01273352061.20; ur.01255535170.75; ]|International Journal of Social Welfare|2002|11|1|53-65|10.1111/1468-2397.00196|pub.1048999605|66;[Kraut, Robert; Patterson, Michael; Lundmark, Vicki; Kiesler, Sara; Mukopadhyay, Tridas; Scherlis, William]|[ur.01065212052.21; ur.01166444620.99; ur.01234560020.49; ur.01345706760.32; ; ur.010534440251.33]|American Psychologist|1998|53|9|1017-1031|10.1037/0003-066x.53.9.1017|pub.1051620085|2732;[Mcquaid, Ronald W.]|[ur.010521665531.52]|Regional Studies|2002|36|8|909-919|10.1080/0034340022000012333|pub.1052714796|41;[Huggins, Robert; Izushi, Hiro]|[ur.011253325321.73; ur.011332420503.59]|Local Economy The Journal of the Local Economy Policy Unit|2002|17|2|111-122|10.1080/02690940210129870|pub.1058312313|42;[Silcock, R]|[]|Parliamentary Affairs|2001|54|1|88-101|10.1093/pa/54.1.88|pub.1059968080|184;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]||2001||||10.1017/cbo9781139164887|pub.1098663486|2054"
pub.1016645720,10.1108/14777830910950667,CSR in Ghana? Diversity should not mean dumping,"The purpose of this paper is to explore corporate social responsibility in context of the dumping of electronic waste (e‐waste), inferior products and second‐hand goods, and related activities of multinational corporations' (MNCs') subsidiaries in Ghana. It aims to suggest examples and recommendations to help curb the negative effects of dumping in Ghana. Research into specific e‐waste and scavenging activities and its impact on indigenous people and the environment is analyzed. Furthermore, findings on relevant stakeholders who have interest in this menace are reviewed. There is also a general discussion of the effect of other import/export activities that are tantamount to dumping. One can often observe ignorant scavengers around “recycling sites” demarcating their portions of the waste which includes discarded computers, televisions, micro‐waves, radio sets, and VCR amongst others. These wastes are often carried to strategic points where these people they extract some “valuable” components. It is known that MNCs find it expensive to re‐cycle these wastes in their home countries, thereby diversifying them to “new markets” often termed as “bridging the digital divide”. The hazards involved do not only affect the environment, but also the health of the indigenous people. Furthermore, there is the increase of inferior products as well as second‐hand goods in the country. Governments can set import restrictions, the pressure groups can help take appropriate actions to mitigate the effects. Educating the indigenous people in consciousness in the health hazards in e‐waste becomes necessary. Proper disposal and re‐cycling activities should be implemented by the government and collaborated by MNCs. This paper can be seen as an initial attempt to integrate the effect of dumping and contributions from stakeholders to enforce MNCs and their subsidiaries to be socially responsible in the Ghanaian business environment.",Management of Environmental Quality An International Journal,2009,20,3,271-277,"Ndzibah, Emmanuel",Vaasa University of Applied Sciences,Finland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016645720,9,"[Ketola, Tarja]|[ur.013502511507.44]|Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management|2006|13|2|98-107|10.1002/csr.113|pub.1011291250|33;[Schoenung, Julie M.; Ogunseitan, Oladele A.; Saphores, Jean Daniel M.; Shapiro, Andrew A.]|[ur.0740573341.69; ur.0657627020.29; ur.01271174165.27; ur.0725742220.66]|Journal of Industrial Ecology|2004|8|4|59-85|10.1162/1088198043630496|pub.1021185325|40"
pub.1047049146,10.4018/978-1-59140-789-8.ch238,Toward U-Government in Japan,"Japan is set to move forward to developing a broadband and ubiquitous network society as envisioned under the concept of an advanced information society. And the successful implementation of e-government in Japan will serve as the foundation to achieving this goal. How does e-government affect the government itself, the business sector and the citizens? According to a 2005 user survey by the Institute of E-Government, the two main benefits of e-government are improved accessibility to information and transaction, and greater accountability from the government. To administer e-government in the country, the role of public sector and computerizations in various government agencies were taken into consideration. However, if computerization is limited to central government, this is of limited benefit to citizens. Thus, for communication between citizens and government, there is a need to go mainly through local government, not the central government directly. There is also a need to refer to e-municipality or e-local government, considering it of equal importance to e-government. It is also important to take into account issues against some aspects of an information society, but being overly anxious about them causes obstacles to promoting e-government. These issues include information security problems, lack of unified management of agencies and the risk of socio-economic digital divide. As such, one of the problems that every country has to face in promoting e-government is the legal system, embedded in every democratic government. Computerization and informatization of the government is, in one respect, an effective administrative and fiscal reform, but requires legal mandates. Thus, reforms in the legal system, including regulation system, are inevitably called for.",Encyclopedia of Digital Government,2007,,,1554-1561,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Malkia, Matti; Obi, T.",Waseda University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047049146,1,
pub.1018302776,10.1108/00012530810908210,Flickr: a case study of Web2.0,"Purpose The “photosharing” site Flickr is one of the most commonly cited examples used to define Web2.0. This paper aims to explore where Flickr's real novelty lies, examining its functionality and its place in the world of amateur photography. Several optimistic views of the impact of Flickr such as its facilitation of citizen journalism, “vernacular creativity” and in learning as an “affinity space” are evaluated.   Design/methodology/approach The paper draws on a wide range of sources including published interviews with its developers, user opinions expressed in forums, telephone interviews and content analysis of user profiles and activity.   Findings Flickr's development path passes from an innovative social game to a relatively familiar model of a web site, itself developed through intense user participation but later stabilising with the reassertion of a commercial relationship to the membership. The broader context of the impact of Flickr is examined by looking at the institutions of amateur photography and particularly the code of pictorialism promoted by the clubs and industry during the twentieth century. The nature of Flickr as a benign space is premised on the way the democratic potential of photography is controlled by such institutions. The limits of optimistic claims about Flickr are identified in the way that the system is designed to satisfy commercial purposes, continuing digital divides in access and the low interactivity and criticality on Flickr.   Originality/value Flickr is an interesting source of change, but can only be understood in the perspective of long‐term development of the hobby and wider social processes. By setting Flickr in such a broad context, its significance and that of Web2.0 more generally can be fully assessed.",Aslib Journal of Information Management,2008,60,5,493-516,"Cox, Andrew M.",University of Sheffield,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018302776,30,"[Whiteman, John L.]|[]|Prometheus|1990|8|1|35-49|10.1080/08109029008631872|pub.1006854081|18;[]|[]|WISSEN HOCH 12|2008|||60-63|10.1007/978-3-540-74547-1_16|pub.1012053894|1;[Machin, David]|[]|Visual Communication|2004|3|3|316-336|10.1177/1470357204045785|pub.1014408740|161;[Marlow, Cameron; Naaman, Mor; Boyd, Danah; Davis, Marc]|[ur.010401226453.62; ur.015357052212.33; ur.01122301013.46; ur.015511336653.29]|Proceedings of the seventeenth conference on Hypertext and hypermedia  - HYPERTEXT '06|2006|||31-40|10.1145/1149941.1149949|pub.1020716815|562;[]|[]|The Lancet Neurology|2007|6|11|950|10.1016/s1474-4422(07)70260-0|pub.1028984473|11;[Schwartz, Dona]|[]|Research on Language and Social Interaction|1987|21|1-4|251-281|10.1080/08351818709389292|pub.1030891439|2;[Davies, Julia]|[]|E-Learning and Digital Media|2006|3|2|217-234|10.2304/elea.2006.3.2.217|pub.1053784978|27;[Watney, Simon]|[]|Screen|1984|25|1|67-73|10.1093/screen/25.1.67|pub.1060025363|2;[Cohen, Kris R.]|[]|Media Culture & Society|2005|27|6|883-901|10.1177/0163443705057675|pub.1063749953|77;[Kilborn, Richard]|[]|European Journal of Communication|1994|9|4|421-439|10.1177/0267323194009004003|pub.1063797503|73;[Schwartz, Dona]|[]|Journal of Contemporary Ethnography|1986|15|2|165-195|10.1177/089124168601500202|pub.1063868302|18;[Werry, Chris]|[]|First Monday|1999|4|9||10.5210/fm.v4i9.690|pub.1072710510|28;[Meyer, Eric T.; Hara, Noriko; Rosenbaum, Howard S.]|[; ; ]|SSRN Electronic Journal|2005||||10.2139/ssrn.1353879|pub.1102262778|4"

Such an instrument, tapping into digital divides, could fill the existing void that exists between previously developed computer literacy or experience scales and the ever faster development of Internet technology. The research was conducted in 2 stages. The first study (N = 284) tested 52 Internet fluency items. A principle component factor analysis with varimax rotation resulted in 21 remaining items in 4 constructs: computer fluency (α = .85), e-mail fluency (α = .89), Web navigation (α = .84), and Web editing (α = .82). The 4-factor solution accounted for more than 67% of the total variance. Correlation analysis showed that there was no multicolinearity of items. The second study (N = 143) aimed at testing the CEW Fluency Scale for reliability and validity. Participants completed a 77-item questionnaire containing the CEW Fluency Scale, the Computer Use Scale (Panero, Lane, & Napier, 1997), items from the Georgia Tech WWW survey (GVU, 1998), and demographic items. The 4 constructs of the CEW Fluency Scale held up in the reliability analysis, as Cronbach's alphas were as follows: computer fluency (α = .72), e-mail fluency (α = .75), Web navigation (α = .64), and Web editing (α = .79). Correlation analysis showed that comfort with the computer or the Internet, or satisfaction with one's skills, correlated highly with the CEW fluency items. Regression analysis revealed that duration of Internet usage and level of expertise as defined by the Georgia Tech WWW survey were the strongest predictors of CEW fluency, R = .614, adjusted R² = .368, F(2, 131) = 39.643, p < .001.

pub.1025933710,10.1145/1562164.1562201,Technical opinion Falling into the net: main street America playing games and making friends online,"In 1999, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration report Falling through the Net noted that ""NTIA has found that there is still a significant ""digital divide"" separating American information ""haves"" and ""have nots."" Indeed, in many instances, the digital divide has widened in the last year."" From the Internet's earliest days, there has been concern about its possible pernicious social effects. Even as millions began Internet surfing, critics averred the Internet was also harming users by destroying social interaction and eroding community involvement. Yet we may ask, what have been the experiences of the bulk of Internet users? Have they experienced loss of friends and involvement in the world due to Internet use, as claimed? Has their social world become hollow? These questions need to be addressed with the best data available. We are trying to answer these questions as part of the Syntopia Project, which has tracked growth and influence in ordinary life of the Internet since the mid-1990s. The Project's basic conclusion in 2002 was that the online and off-line world are becoming blended, and that concerns about lack of community are overblown. This view has been further reinforced by results from our most recent survey.  In February and March, 2007, we conducted a nationally representative survey of 1404 Americans 18 years of age and older. This survey explored several dimensions of the way people are using the Internet, including how much they are involved in games and online simulations, their feelings of community, and the extent to which they are making online friendships, including friendships that migrate from the virtual world to the physical world. We found that 67% of respondents (N = 943) were Internet users (compared to the 71% reported by the Pew Internet in American Life Project, and the 70% reported by Internet World Stats, (both of which included people below the age of 18). Surprisingly, in light of all the concern about a gender gap in terms of Internet usage, there were almost identical levels of usage by men and women (a trend that we discerned as early as our 2000 survey). Many respondents use the Internet intensively. About one out of three respondents say they spend three or more hours on the Internet in a typical day, while two thirds of users spend one or two hours a day (47% estimate one hour a day, and 20% estimate two hours per day). 28% estimate they use it between three to nine hours per day, and 5% are online more than nine hours a day. There were no significant differences between males and females across these levels of Internet usage. Given its image as something that only teens do (and that we only surveyed those 18 or older), our results showed that multiplayer gaming is thriving with 9.7% of Internet users playing them. We asked ""Do you play online games that involve other players? Like Second Life, World of Warcraft or the SIMS""? Males (5.4%) play them in slightly greater proportion than females (4.3%). At the Internet's outset, there was much concern about the isolating and potentially depressing effects of the Internet. While our 2007 survey did not definitively address these questions, it did find that one-fifth of Internet users consider themselves to be ""a member of an online community."" There was practically no difference between males and females in the answers to this question. Moreover, there was very little difference between the genders in terms of how many friends they made online -- a median of about five. In fact, far from isolating people from social interaction, the Internet is a source of new face-to-face friendships, perhaps restoring some of the sociability that has been eroded due to television and suburbia (as argued persuasively by Putnam in Bowling Alone [2001]). As Table 1 shows, the Internet has spawned many new virtual friendships. About 16% of respondents have made a friend through the Internet. As was the case with Internet community, there is virtually no difference in male (17%) versus female (14%) responses to these questions. In addition, just over half (54%) of these people who have made a new online friend have gone on to meet the new friend in person, with slightly more males (59%) than females (50%) doing so. A quick but very rough extrapolation can be made to estimate the number of new face-to-face friendships. In the United States there are approximately 225 million people over the age of 18; as approximately 70% of them are online, this means that there are approximately 157.5 million adults online. Assuming 16% of these made even just one friend on line, this results in an estimated 25.2 million new friendships. Continuing the assumption, if 54% of those went on to meet two new friends in person (based on our data, and assuming just one meeting with each), that would mean that there have been 27 million face-to-face meetings due to the Internet involvement. Of course, this is only crude estimate, yet nonetheless it clearly gives a sense that the Internet is a pro-social technology. Our data also refute the notion that the Internet is still the domain of males, geeks, and young people. In 1999, the NTIA report there is still a significant digital divide. While these groups continue to have an impressive presence online, the face of the today's Internet is much more reflective of the overall population, at least with respect to gender. In particular, sharp assertions about the Internet being discriminatory against, irrelevant to, or unfriendly towards females finds very little support it in our current national survey (as in our 2000 survey). To the extent computer professionals dedicated to producing new Internet-based services may have labored under a cloud of fear that their work was exacerbating loneliness, gender divides, or the dissipation of social engagement, the findings of this recent survey represent good news.",Communications of the ACM,2009,52,9,149-150,"Katz, James; Rice, Ronald E.","Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey; University of California System",United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025933710,6,"[Putnam, Robert D.]|[]|Proceedings of the 2000 ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work  - CSCW '00|2000|||357|10.1145/358916.361990|pub.1098865239|10614"
pub.1042329554,10.1007/978-3-540-39966-7_46,Intertwined Digital Rays in Discrete Radon Projections Pooled over Adjacent Prime Sized Arrays,"Digital projections are image intensity sums taken along directed rays that sample whole pixel values at periodic locations along the ray. For 2D square arrays with sides of prime length, the Discrete Radon Transform (DRT) is very efficient at reconstructing digital images from their digital projections. The periodic gaps in digital rays complicate the use of the DRT for efficient reconstruction of tomographic images from real projection data, where there are no gaps along the projection direction. A new approach to bridge this gap problem is to pool DRT digital projections obtained over a variety of prime sized arrays. The digital gaps are then partially filled by a staggered overlap of discrete sample positions to better approximate a continuous projection ray. This paper identifies primes that have similar and distinct DRT pixel sampling patterns for the rays in digital projections. The projections are effectively pooled by combining several images, each reconstructed at a fixed scale, but using projections that are interpolated over different prime sized arrays. The basis for the pooled image reconstruction approach is outlined and we demonstrate the principle of this mechanism works.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2003,2886,,485-494,"Svalbe, Imants; Kingston, Andrew",Monash University,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042329554,3,"[Salzberg, Pablo M.; Figueroa, Raul]|[ur.016671141157.48; ur.013577111757.04]|Applied and Numerical Harmonic Analysis|1999|||417-434|10.1007/978-1-4612-1568-4_19|pub.1005069357|9;[Svalbe, Imants]|[ur.01200347405.36]|Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science|2001|46||269-284|10.1016/s1571-0661(04)80992-7|pub.1020781837|5;[Svalbe, Imants; van der Spek, Dimitri]|[ur.01200347405.36; ]|Linear Algebra and its Applications|2001|339|1-3|125-145|10.1016/s0024-3795(01)00487-6|pub.1023348810|38;[Svalbe, Imants]|[ur.01200347405.36]|Discrete Applied Mathematics|2004|139|1-3|265-281|10.1016/j.dam.2002.11.005|pub.1030578710|10;[Svalbe, Imants; Kingston, Andrew]|[ur.01200347405.36; ur.01022567614.71]|Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics|2003|12||154-165|10.1016/s1571-0653(04)00482-2|pub.1046375036|9;[Matus, F.; Flusser, J.]|[ur.014356036053.38; ur.01065304627.40]|IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|1993|15|10|996-1006|10.1109/34.254058|pub.1061155928|143;[Beylkin, G.]|[ur.016177613765.89]|IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing|1987|35|2|162-172|10.1109/tassp.1987.1165108|pub.1061520106|298"
pub.1095613624,10.1109/wts.2007.4563309,Wireless Internet Competition: Municipal Wireless vs. 3G mobile Service,"With an emphasis on creating ubiquitous Internet access to bridge the digital gap between location and access speed, the refinement of wireless technologies has it so that cities can reap the socio-economic benefits of the Internet. The 3rd generation (3G)and wireless fidelity (WiFi) are the two main wireless technologies which access Internet using wireless devices. Some major cities in the U.S. have either deployed or have future plans to roll-out city-wide broadband wireless network using WiFi technology. Even if 3G and WiFi have different origins and features, they will become competing wireless Internet access services in the near future. In this paper, using a game theory, the authors build a competition model of 3G and WiFi and demonstrate which technology will have a better market position and what an optimal pricing strategy is through equilibrium analysis. The authors found that in the equilibrium analysis, WiFi could have a better market position in the future. On the other hand, by using a higher pricing strategy, the profit of 3G providers would be higher than that of WiFi providers. Finally, the municipal WiFi could be useful as a public Internet access method and prove to be competitive in this market with its attractive low pricing.",2007 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium,2007,,,1-6,"Shim, J.

It can be considered as a way to bridge the digital gap. How a computer novice performs in such virtual and asynchronous learning environments is an interesting issue in human–computer interaction research. This paper presents the results of a study to investigate on-line learning performance and computer anxiety for unemployed adult novices. In this study, we propose a novel idea that integrates the concept of Shannon entropy into a grey relational analysis model. The proposed method was used to measure human information behavior in relation to on-line learning performance and computer anxiety. A total of 115 unemployed adults voluntarily participated in the experimental study. All experimental subjects were divided into groups according to individual differences in gender, age ranges, educational levels, and learning performances. Taking advantage of the grey relation entropy operation, we derived the perceptive correlations among different classified groups in terms of the accessibility of on-line learning and computer anxiety scales, respectively. Through the empirical study, certain on-line learning characteristics were also identified.",Information Processing & Management,2009,45,2,200-215,"Chou, Jyh-Rong; Tsai, Hung-Cheng",Fortune Institute of Technology; National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology,Taiwan; Taiwan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018066287,28,"[Mikkelsen, Aslaug; Øgaard, Torvald; Lindøe, Preben H.; Olsen, Odd Einar]|[ur.01001764652.33; ur.013244517007.81; ur.016255532341.65; ur.014172270023.40]|Computers in Human Behavior|2002|18|3|223-239|10.1016/s0747-5632(01)00051-6|pub.1002823128|34;[Tsuchiya, Toshio; Maeda, Tatsushi; Matsubara, Yukihiro; Nagamachi, Mitsuo]|[ur.013260700624.91; ur.015500614233.74; ur.012111323735.00; ur.07426332072.20]|International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics|1996|18|2-3|135-145|10.1016/0169-8141(95)00076-3|pub.1003313428|45;[Korukonda, Appa Rao]|[ur.014376566014.28]|Computers in Human Behavior|2007|23|4|1921-1942|10.1016/j.chb.2006.02.003|pub.1007080772|49;[Todman, John; Day, Kenneth]|[ur.015120571004.55; ]|Computers in Human Behavior|2006|22|5|856-869|10.1016/j.chb.2004.03.009|pub.1012097707|30;[Bozionelos, Nikos]|[ur.013707647723.08]|International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|2004|61|5|725-746|10.1016/j.ijhcs.2004.07.001|pub.1016064429|60;[Smith, Brooke; Caputi, Peter]|[; ]|Behaviour and Information Technology|2001|20|4|265-273|10.1080/01449290110069392|pub.1020994750|24;[Brosnan, M.

pub.1070759339,10.2457/srs.39.465,電気通信事業のユニバーサルサービスに関する分析,"The primary theme of this report is the study and estimation of universal services of telephone carriers. Telephone services spread throughout Japan by the telecommunication policy after World War II. Now telephone has become indispensable for present day life. In this regard, to provide equal telecommunication services, “universal services” have been promoted by a law that obliges telephone carriers to complete basic infrastructures throughout the nation. As a result, telephone services with uniform charges have spread throughout Japan. Development of telecommunication technology has drastically changed the communication tools from fixed-line phones to cellular phones. Moreover, due to a wide range of access platforms including internet services and broadband, the telephone policies both for providing new services and for attaining optimum distribution of resources need to be re-considered. In this paper, we analyze basic economic theory and practices including the basic concept of universal services. This study also shows that technological advances in telephone functions require an amendment to the present universal services and enforcement of adequate public policies. The major findings are summarized as follows. First, landlines spread all over Japan after World War II when the government incorporated the rules of universal service systems. Now everybody can equally and uniformly access the services. Second, theoretically universal services are necessary to increase the external effects of networking and to diminish the digital divide. Third, our empirical examination showed a great difference in the maintenance costs of equipment per capita and this difference is mainly due to differences in population density. This means that without the promotion of universal services, the services can not be provided in high cost areas. In this regard, newcomers such as cellular phones can never provide their services to uncommercial regions.

Today every policy initiative and strategy formulated by the government and private sectors, be it Broadband policy, e-governance, triple play, expanding telemedicine capabilities, distance education, computing grid for research and development or digital entertainment, assumes a robust, high speed and end- to-end connectivity infrastructure. Though there has been a considerable growth of telecom in India over the past few years and a sizeable infrastructure has already been developed, in a vast country like India this touches only a smaller proportion of the population and the geographic spread. Last miles are still a problem area for many operators owing to lack of economic viability. Therefore, Innovative and non-conventional alternatives are to be explored for infrastructure expansion. Convergence of power and telecom infrastructures is viewed, world-over, as a viable alternative to address rapid expansion and better reach. Power transmission networks being the most pervasive and readily available network, are already being exploited as ready infrastructures for overlaying telecom networks (fiber networks). While the present level of infrastructure convergence Is more on the backbone network side (use of Optical Ground Wire (OPGW) on power transmission infrastructure), innovative concepts such as Broadband over Power Line (BPL) unleashes a truly powerful convergence enabling delivery of high speed telecom bandwidth to home on existing power sockets thus promising not only a networked home but an intelligent power utility grid too. With the concept of BPL, power infrastructure provides an end-to-end infrastructure to build telecom highways and tributaries as well. This paper discusses the potential of power-telecom convergence in addressing the backbone, middle mile and last mile needs of telecom and also dwells on upcoming concept of BPL and the challenges posed.",IETE Technical Review,2005,22,5,367-372,"Santhosh, Jayashree; Nair, Santhosh S; Jayasankar, M N",Power Grid Corporation (India),India,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049995008,0,

Design/methodology/approach The survey has covered 17 libraries belonging to Shahid Bahonar University, Kerman Medical University and Islamic Azad University. Two kinds of questionnaires were distributed to libraries – one for librarians and the other for library staff. The findings of the survey have been analyzed using SPSS software.   Findings Results show that the level of application of information technology in Kerman academic libraries is acceptable but they should improve their status to match with ever increasing demand for better librarian services at universities; the most important problem and serious difficulty is the lack of educated librarians, which needs a suitable investment and planning; and, although about 70 percent of librarians in Kerman academic libraries have participated in related training courses, the most serious difficulty in using information technology is still the lack of educated librarians.   Practical implications Based on the research findings, several suggestions for improvements can be made, for example: recruitment of multi‐skilled librarians familiar with information technologies related to the mechanism of work in academic libraries; planning and designing ongoing courses of information technology and related skills; promotion and introduction of various academic library services through compiling and publishing manuals and guides; equipping academic libraries with more information technology facilities; having a special budget for development of information technology infrastructure; overcoming telecommunication barriers and shortcomings to better use of information technology; and mechanization of all academic library departments to provide information services more optimally and speedily.   Originality/value The research studies the rate of using information technologies in Iran as a developing country.

pub.1003440018,10.1145/2072069.2072093,Empirical study of factors influencing acceptance of e-government services in India,"Around the world, governments have increased the use of Information and Communication Technologies to improve public services delivery and dissemination of information to public. Most of the developed nations are at the advanced stage of e-governance implementation while the developing nations have increased their focus only in the last decade. Among the developing countries, India has made significant progress in the technical implementation of e-governance benefitting from the easy availability of technical resources in-house, highly professional civil services and committed leadership. However, the adoption and dissemination is constrained on one hand by digital divide and on the other hand by the issues related to the adoption of technology. One of the most important and advanced e-governance initiatives, e-filing of income tax returns, is a glaring example where just 10% of the total returns filed in 2009 were through e-filing [18]. This requires examination of the factors influencing the citizen's adoption of e-government services. Since e-filing has been a flagship implementation of e-governance in India and has a huge potential for cost savings, this study focused on the individual tax payer's adoption of e-filing. The study is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model and is extended to include perceived risk and user experience with computer systems and tax calculations. To test the model, a survey was administered to 189 taxpayers and regression analysis is used to test the model hypotheses. The result supports the impact of perceived risk on the behavioral intention. The tax payers are not comfortable with the transaction happening without face to face contact and are worried that their personal information will leak into third parties. Thus, in order to attract taxpayers for e-filing, the government has to improve the performance expectancy, effort expectancy and provide confidence to tax payers about the safe and risk free system.",Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance - ICEGOV '11,2011,,,141-146,"Israel, Duraipandian; Tiwari, Rakesh",Xavier School of Management,India,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1003440018,6,"[Im, Il; Kim, Yongbeom; Han, Hyo-Joo]|[ur.014116505705.47; ur.015760665144.14; ur.013343736465.89]|Information & Management|2008|45|1|1-9|10.1016/j.im.2007.03.005|pub.1001596620|296;[Cronbach, Lee J.]|[ur.013704476074.07]|Psychometrika|1951|16|3|297-334|10.1007/bf02310555|pub.1002958101|24262;[Fu, Jen-Ruei; Farn, Cheng-Kiang; Chao, Wen-Pin]|[ur.011634627236.25; ur.015703507726.19; ur.010602337615.08]|Information & Management|2006|43|1|109-126|10.1016/j.im.2005.04.001|pub.1011641532|184;[Featherman, Mauricio S.; Pavlou, Paul A.]|[ur.012750605455.40; ur.016166254325.43]|International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|2003|59|4|451-474|10.1016/s1071-5819(03)00111-3|pub.1019784411|1411;[Carter, Lemuria; Bélanger, France]|[ur.010501313522.42; ur.07347634165.87]|Information Systems Journal|2005|15|1|5-25|10.1111/j.1365-2575.2005.00183.x|pub.1020923035|1145;[Ajzen, Icek]|[ur.011652717561.39]|Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|1991|50|2|179-211|10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-t|pub.1028082114|43112;[Davis, Fred D.; Bagozzi, Richard P.; Warshaw, Paul R.]|[ur.014060724401.60; ur.0712073700.63; ur.015250026703.09]|Journal of Applied Social Psychology|1992|22|14|1111-1132|10.1111/j.1559-1816.1992.tb00945.x|pub.1035983250|3300;[Compeau, Deborah R.; Higgins, Christopher A.]|[ur.07600141101.06; ur.014370362035.54]|Information Systems Research|1995|6|2|118-143|10.1287/isre.6.2.118|pub.1064711981|763;[Sebie, Madi Al; Irani, Zahir]|[ur.015504357042.32; ur.012462056043.16]|Electronic Government an International Journal|2005|2|3|247|10.1504/eg.2005.007778|pub.1067427484|43;[Schaupp, Ludwig Christian; Carter, Lemuria; Hobbs, leff]|[ur.012213624463.45; ur.010501313522.42; ]|2009 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|2009|1||1-10|10.1109/hicss.2009.171|pub.1093636724|12;[Thompson, Ronald L.; Higgins, Christopher A.; Howell, Jane M.]|[; ; ]|MIS Quarterly|1991|15|1|125|10.2307/249443|pub.1102514883|1717;[Davis, Fred D.]|[]|MIS Quarterly|1989|13|3|319|10.2307/249008|pub.1102514932|25625"

One of the most successful industries in using ICT as a means for development of new products as well as marketing and sales activities, is the entertainment industry. The games industry is developing rapidly and has penetrated every layer of society. In 1998 video and electronic game revenues reached USD 5.5bn in North American markets alone. The annual increase has been approximately 25% during a number of years.The success of ICT based entertainment products depends to a high degree on the penetration of PCs and Internet connections. Many governments all over the world have strategies and programs in order to reduce the digital divide and to offer all citizens Internet access. In the not so distant future Internet access will be as natural as water, electricity, radio or telephone.Time is more and more becoming an important variable for market segmentation. Everybody has 24 hours per day and night at his or her disposal. However, the perception of time varies. Some feel they have too much time and they are time-rich. Some feel that they have too little time and they are time-poor.Traditionally, time-rich people were also money-rich, but the big majority was both time-poor and money-poor. This is completely turned upside down in the Information society. Nowadays people are equally divided between time-rich and money-poor, and time-poor and money-rich. Both time-rich and time-poor need entertainment and are potential consumers of entertainment especially games as e-services but in different ways.This is a conceptual paper and its purpose is to investigate the importance of the division on time-rich and time-poor for the entertainment industry and practical implications with a special focus on computer games as products and e-services.",International Business & Economics Research Journal (IBER),2011,2,7,,"Lindskog, Helena; Larsson, Rasmus",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1068743946,0,

Design/methodology/approach Desk research was conducted using secondary data sources followed by a field survey conducted with 412 sample respondents in three major cities of Jordan. Following the triangulation approach, the responses of university professors and the common people were also secured.   Findings The Jordanian government's efforts towards e‐governance are commendable in the Middle East. However, there are certain impediments that are witnessed in the form of the digital divide, corruption, social bottlenecks, the stage of democratization, the lack of marketing to stakeholders, and the citizen's lack of adoption of technology. Educated people are aware of the merit of e‐governance contrary to the uneducated ones and perceive that corruption in the Jordanian public sector is increasing.   Research limitations/implications The study mainly reflects the views of the educated people. The views of the uneducated ones are secured through basic interactions as they expressed their inability to respond to the questionnaires. Somehow, the respondents are not very open to freely share their opinions or have abstained from participation‐since they consider this a sensitive issue within the Jordanian cultural and political setup. Further, asking opinions of members of the public might not be the ideal way of judging the level of corruption, or changes in it.   Originality/value People's perception is that Jordan is affected by a low level of corruption and that its citizens lack awareness of e‐governance. To remedy this, its citizens need to be motivated to trust and to participate in the process of e‐governance and to increase their understanding of the tools and technologies available.",Journal of Information Communication and Ethics in Society,2008,6,4,317-333,"Belwal, Rakesh; Al‐Zoubi, Khalid",Sohar University,Oman,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016972321,28,"[Zekos, Georgios I.]|[ur.015662415541.90]|Journal of Management Development|2004|23|7|631-647|10.1108/02621710410546641|pub.1000161904|28;[Brown, George]|[]|Journal of Financial Regulation and Compliance|2007|15|2|180-185|10.1108/13581980710744066|pub.1001311305|3;[Marche, Sunny; McNiven, James D.]|[ur.012615377351.59; ur.01150221542.25]|Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences / Revue Canadienne des Sciences de l Administration|2009|20|1|74-86|10.1111/j.1936-4490.2003.tb00306.x|pub.1004613078|166;[Bishop, Patrick]|[]|Australian Journal of Public Administration|2004|63|2|117-118|10.1111/j.1467-8500.2004.00383.x|pub.1013753474|1;[Ampratwum, Edward Fokuoh]|[ur.014431016325.14]|Journal of Money Laundering Control|2008|11|1|76-87|10.1108/13685200810844514|pub.1014141754|38;[Mahmood, Rumel]|[]|Perspectives on Global Development and Technology|2004|3|3|347-373|10.1163/1569150042442539|pub.1017656686|37;[Bowman, Diana; Gilligan, George]|[; ]|Journal of Financial Crime|2007|14|4|438-452|10.1108/13590790710828154|pub.1019726354|22;[Pathak, R.

They can boost business, support education and health systems and also enhance the governance that is a major and vital factor in the development process. It is commonly agreed that e-Government systems enhance governance, but, unfortunately, there is a lack of empirical evidence to build upon this hypothesis, which, legitimately, creates reluctance among key decision makers, slows down the dissemination of technology as a decision support tool and as development enabler/infrastructure and contribute to the very dangerous phenomena known as the digital divide. In the context of Fez e-Government Project, that is being led in Morocco, in a close collaboration with the municipality of the Moroccan city of Fez, authors have developed a pilot e-Government system that facilitates citizens’ access to governmental information and services. From the outset of this 30 months project, the goal was to collect and analyze experimental data in order to see how the development/deployment of e-government systems impacted the governance process. This research has set up a methodology that emphasizes good governance at each step of an e-Government project and enables the researchers to continuously assess the outcomes of the resulting e-Gov system on governance. The ultimate goal is to reduce, as much as possible, the reluctance of politicians and decision makers and to contribute in the dissemination of technology for development purposes thru a scientific and proven methodology that systematically links e-Government outcomes to good governance attributes. In this chapter, authors present the main phases of this methodology and lessons learned during the e-Fez Project. This approach may benefit similar projects, especially in developing countries that are willing to create and deploy e-Government systems for the benefit of their citizens.",Handbook of Research on E-Government Readiness for Information and Service Exchange,2010,,,435-464,"Rahman, Hakikur; Kettani, Driss; Moulin, Bernard; Mahdi, Asmae El",Al Akhawayn University; Université Laval,Morocco; Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1012150618,0,"[Heeks, Richard]|[]||1999||||10.4324/9780203204962|pub.1018877449|291;[Moloi, Julie; Mutula, Stephen]|[; ur.013325104101.71]|Information Development|2007|23|4|290-306|10.1177/0266666907084765|pub.1023841160|28;[Kettani, Driss; Gurstein, Michael; Moulin, Bernard; El Mahdi, Asmae]|[ur.016405776517.81; ur.012073246717.52; ur.010077271365.16; ]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2006|4277||301-310|10.1007/11915034_53|pub.1025649553|6;[Braibant, Guy]|[]|International Review of Administrative Sciences|2002|68|3|333-343|10.1177/0020852302683002|pub.1033097464|8;[Peters, B Guy]|[]|Asian Journal of Public Administration|2002|24|2|153-183|10.1080/02598272.2002.10800399|pub.1039808999|16;[Felts, Arthur A.; Jos, Philip H.]|[ur.016671450445.33; ur.014666325130.22]|Administrative Theory & Praxis|2000|22|3|519-533|10.1080/10841806.2000.11643469|pub.1047160357|13;[Brinkerhoff, Derick W.; Goldsmith, Arthur A.]|[ur.014277064103.42; ur.010400717355.29]|Administration & Society|2005|37|2|199-224|10.1177/0095399704272595|pub.1063731017|55;[Brewer, Gene A.; Neubauer, Bruce J.; Geiselhart, Karin]|[ur.012210243621.38; ur.014152352565.49; ur.014331751713.82]|Administration & Society|2006|38|4|472-499|10.1177/0095399706290638|pub.1063731069|74;[Bislev, Sven]|[ur.010566124743.34]|International Political Science Review|2004|25|3|281-296|10.1177/0192512104043017|pub.1063752642|20;[Picciotto, Robert]|[]|American Journal of Evaluation|2003|24|2|227-234|10.1177/109821400302400206|pub.1063979884|17;[Tafor, Vivan]|[]|ESARBICA Journal Journal of the Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Branch of the International Council on Archives|2004|22|1||10.4314/esarjo.v22i1.30957|pub.1072476816|6;[]|[]|Choice|2002|40|02|40-1165-40-1165|10.5860/choice.40-1165|pub.1073382743|884;[Kettani, Driss; Moulin, Bernard; Mahdi, Asmae El]|[ur.016405776517.81; ur.010077271365.16; ur.015227420403.46]|2008 International MCETECH Conference on e-Technologies (mcetech 2008)|2008|||227-231|10.1109/mcetech.2008.35|pub.1094338886|3;[Heeks, Richard]|[]||2006||||10.4135/9781446220191|pub.1099335017|215"
pub.1143070080,10.1115/imece2001/bed-23098,Development of an Input Interface Using Ocular Potential for Handicapped Users of Health Care Supporting Computer,"Abstract Numerous attempts to adapt multimedia communication to medical care have been reported recently. It is our view that spiritual support is more important in medical care, while so-called high technology may be necessary for medical practice. Therefore, we proposed the concept of the Hyper Hospital [1–3], to offer patients a means of effective human communication during medical care. The Hyper Hospital is a medical system constructed on a computer and multimedia based-network, which patients use to participate in medical and care activities through improved communication media. It is sometimes difficult for physically handicapped patients, such as PMD (progressive muscular dystrophy), ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), and traumatic cervical injury patients, to operate a computer, because of their disabilities. Therefore, there is a serious digital divide between physically disabled patients and healthy people. To remedy this, various communication devices, such as those using winking, eye gaze, voice, and electrical biological signals (event-related potential [4–5], electrooculogram, etc.) have been proposed and tested. These are designed to enable seriously handicapped patients to use a computer without using the usual mechanical input devices, such as a keyboard, mouse, or joystick. Although an EEG (electroencephalogram) offers one source of such potential electrical biological signals, it produces a very weak electrical signal that contaminating noise makes difficult to process. On the other hand, the ocular potential generated by the dipolar potential of the eyeball has a much larger gain in potential than the EEG. Moreover, the ocular potential can be easily controlled by the user, and eye-movement ability remains largely intact, even after neurological diseases progress to a very advanced stage. Therefore, this report studied the development of an input interface for computers using an electrooculogram.",Advances in Bioengineering,2001,,,197-198,"Mizuno, F.; Harada, A.; Yamaguchi, T.",Nagoya Institute of Technology,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143070080,0,

It has its starting point in the Swedish Government’s endeavour to turn Sweden into the first ‘information society for all’. When the available statistics concerning the access to a PC and the Internet in Swedish homes are studied it is easy to think that this vision may soon be realised. Of course, access to the technical equipment is a fundamental condition in order to be able to use the Public Information Systems, but unfortunately, is not the only one. Several studies have shown that it is not possible to equate possession and use. A number of access models or frameworks designed to judge whether or not a person has access to the ICTs do exist. However, it is my opinion that there is a deficiency in these models; they do not start out from the individual user’s prerequisites, but rather judge the external conditions available for possible access. Assisted by four empirical studies, interviews and questionnaires, a number of access barriers experienced by the users have been identified. The studies show that in addition to the technological hindrances, a series of more elusive ones also exist originating from prevailing norms and values in the environment the user lives in. The barriers are categorised into five groups: to have, to be able, to will, to may and to dare. Together these notions form the User Centred Access Model, UCAM, which is suggested for use in charting and communicating the necessary considerations that must be taken into account in the development of Public Information Systems aimed for e-governmental issues.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2006,223,,445-455,"Nilsson, Olof",Mid Sweden University,Sweden,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040950985,0,"[Kvasny, Lynette; Trauth, Eileen M.]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.07421642022.90]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2003|110||273-291|10.1007/978-0-387-35634-1_14|pub.1001667144|19;[Popper, Karl R.; Eccles, John C.]|[ur.015402116117.04; ]||1977||||10.1007/978-3-642-61891-8|pub.1006241923|1649;[Gurstein, Michael; Clement, Andrew; Shade, Leslie R.]|[; ur.01204320102.19; ur.07604737473.51]|Community Informatics|2000|||32-51|10.4018/978-1-878289-69-8.ch002|pub.1021193211|57;[van Dijk, Jan; Hacker, Kenneth]|[; ]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|315-326|10.1080/01972240309487|pub.1047421245|709;[Science Institute, Informing]|[ur.015774355540.59]|Informing Science|2002|5||113-114|10.28945/541|pub.1092399669|1;[Carveth, Rod; B.

pub.1068622867,10.18352/lq.7798,Crossroads - Bridging the Digital Divide,"It’s so good to be in Cambridge, it feels almost like home. Let me start by stating that in the past year ITMB, a successful map publisher in British Columbia, Canada published more paper map titles than at any time in their history. Similarly, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) recently announced that they have ceased producing paper from their aerial photography archive and will only produce digital copies. I believe that both of these facts speak to the future of maps and digital data. It means there will be paper maps well into the future and there will be an increasing array of digital data - some of it reformatted, as in the USGS case, and most of it will be born digital. When asked to speak about GIS and its role in libraries I often find myself in a conundrum - am I here to slay the dragon, or to pet the dragon. The role of technology in libraries is not one that has been embraced by everyone, and often the technology itself seems to have been force-fed upon us. The library profession is not one that has historically been a proponent of change and the very nature of GIS is change. In one sense, we have been given the choice of becoming paper museums or, at the very least, making GIS technology available in our collections. Today, I would like to review the many ways that GIS is, or will, affect our collections. I will divide the presentation into a general overview of GIS in libraries, how it affects our acquisitions or collection development policies, its effect on cataloging, on reference services, staffing, and our web services. Then I will shift the focus a little and discuss the current situation at the Harvard Map Collection, the future role of legacy collections, and a look to the future.",LIBER Quarterly The Journal of the Association of European Research Libraries,2005,15,1,,"Cobb, David",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1068622867,0,

Since January 2000, the Camfield Estates-MIT Creating Community Connections Project, a partnership between the Camfield Tenants Association and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has taken place at Camfield Estates, a 102-unit, low-to moderate-income housing development in Roxbury, Massachusetts, and its surrounding environs. With support from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, Hewlett-Packard, RCN Telecom Services, Microsoft, and others, every family at Camfield has been offered a state-of-the-art desktop computer, software, high-speed Internet connection via cable-modem, and eight weeks of comprehensive courses — free of charge. Camfield residents are also supported by the Creating Community Connections (C3) System, a web-based, community building system designed at the MIT Media Laboratory, to establish and strengthen relationships between community residents, local businesses, and neighborhood institutions (e.g., libraries, schools, etc.) and organizations. Of the 102 units at Camfield, approximately 80 are presently occupied, while approximately 60 units have elected to participate in the project in some capacity, from among two rounds of sign-ups in September 2000 and January 2001. This paper is a case study of the Camfield Estates-MIT project to-date, including the history and background of the project, the theoretical frameworks guiding the initiative, the project methodology that has been employed to foster resident engagement and integrate community technology and community building, early results, and a set of recommendations and lessons learned for other initiatives.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2002,2362,,110-124,"Pinkett, Randal D.",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013121950,3,"[Resnick, Mitchel; Bruckman, Amy; Martin, Fred]|[ur.01302447054.58; ur.016564766223.99; ur.013373276333.83]|Interactions|1996|3|5|40-50|10.1145/234757.234762|pub.1030563847|126;[]|[]||2002||||10.4018/978-1-93070-833-4|pub.1096031160|20;[]|[]|High Technology and Low-Income Communities|1998||||10.7551/mitpress/3504.003.0017|pub.1110922869|4"

pub.1024249483,10.1080/13691180701193127,Tackling the digital divide: Exploring the impact of ICT on managing heart conditions in a deprived area,"The Internet is increasingly used to communicate health knowledge and there is growing belief that it can help transform both personal and public health. There is no lack of information on healthy lifestyles, but the manner of communication of risk and the level of support for lifestyle change need improvement, especially among deprived populations. Assisting vulnerable persons to increase their health knowledge could help them to be more responsible for maintaining their health. The Internet offers potential for interactivity by providing a dynamic medium for influencing learning and behaviour change, especially in so far as it enables inter-subjective communication among peers. This paper examines how the Internet might help tackle health inequalities by improving communication of risk and providing support for those who are most susceptible to changing their behaviour. The authors provide a descriptive account of whether facilitated access to the Internet may improve the capacity of older men to manage their heart conditions. Nine men aged 50 to 74 living in multiply deprived areas of Salford were given computers, Internet access and training for six months. Interviews and qualitative data were collected to assess the influence the Internet had on the management of their heart conditions before they were given the computers, after six months and three years after they were introduced to the Internet. The study was exploratory but its results suggest that interactive learning is worthwhile because it can help strengthen social support and influence behaviour change. Home access to the Internet via their own personal computer had a beneficial influence in building confidence and facilitating healthy behaviour change.

Some of the unique needs of these populations include information to aid with coping skills and social inclusion, as well as culturally specific information resources. Moreover, immigrant communities have information networks that span national boundaries, which affects their needs and uses of information and communication technologies (ICTs). This panel will focus on the role of ICTs in mediating the information environments of immigrant and diasporic communities. While focusing on how ICTs mediate immigrant information needs, this panel also contextualizes immigrant information behavior research within globalization and diaspora studies. For instance, the concept of “e-diaspora” is a term gaining in popularity, but rarely invoked in relation to immigrant information behavior research. How do new media technologies mediate and influence the information needs and behaviors of immigrant populations? Are localized immigrant information needs mediated by diasporic information sources? The panelists will focus on ICT-mediated services for immigrant populations within the context of both local and global information environments. Questions addressed include: In what ways do diasporic information environments shape local immigrant information needs and their social inclusion into the host society? How does the “digital divide” manifest itself in studies of ICT-mediated immigrant information behavior? The issues addressed by the panel are both timely and critical as evidenced by the ongoing debates in Europe, North America and elsewhere on immigration policy, on integration and identity, and the role of ICTs in a globalized world.

pub.1133390058,10.15353/joci.v1i1.2060,n-Logue: The Story of a Rural Service Provider In India,"Can rural Information Communication Technology (ICT) be an effective tool to bridge the digital divide? How can the Internet help developing nations and their disadvantaged in particular? Those who lobby in favour of rural ICT believe that Internet is not just a means of communication but is also an enabler of livelihood in rural areas and therefore, power. For a very long time now, the developing world has carried the burden of colonization and slavery. This has resulted in a lack of confidence among developing economies and the belief that they are not at par with the rest of the world. The lack of ""access"" has curtailed their ability to compete. In fact, ingenuity and hard work hasn't been adequate for one to enjoy economic and social benefit. In order to acquire these benefits, access to resources like education, health and employment become critical. Internet has been a boon in this regard. Today, one can be in the remotest corner of the world and as long as there is access to Internet enjoy access to education, health and resources. This allows them to compete and use their ingenuity and hard work to bring about a significant difference to their lives. This paper concentrates on how ICT can affect the lives of rural people in the developing world. The total rural population of the developing world is about 3.5 billion, with their average per capita income being no more than $200 per year. India, with 700 million rural people located in 600,000 villages, is a reflection of the developing world. The key issue that is addressed in the paper is whether technology can bring about a difference in the lives of people who earn less than half a dollar a day. Can health and education be made available to them? Can they afford the Internet? And ultimately, can it significantly enhance their livelihoods and income?",The Journal of Community Informatics,2004,1,1,,"Jhunjhunwala, Ashok; Ramachandran, Anuradha; Bandyopadhyay, Alankar",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133390058,19,
pub.1093727364,10.1109/auswireless.2007.27,"Analogy of Promising Wireless Technologies on Different Frequencies: Bluetooth, WiFi, and WiMAX","The explosive growth of the Internet over the last decade has led to an increasing demand for high-speed, ubiquitous Internet access. Broadband wireless technologies are increasingly gaining popularity by the successful global deployment of the wireless personal area networks (Bluetooth-IEEE 802.15.1), wireless local area networks (WiFi- IEEE 802.lln), and wireless metropolitan area networks (WiMAX- IEEE 802.16). New ICT and e-Learning strategies and advances in wireless standards and technologies- particularly in the areas of Bluetooth, WiFi (wireless fidelity), WiMAX (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) and mobile computing can help to bridge the digital divide in education and research. Using open broadband Wireless technologies and implementing mobile computing architectures, one can overcome the challenges of ground, infrastructure, and finance to increase access; deploy broadband quickly and cost-effectively to areas currently not served; and extend the benefits of digital revolution to previously unreachable populations. These technologies aim to provide low-cost, high-performance Wireless access to residential and business applications. As technology evolves to address portable and mobile applications, the required features and performance of the system will increase. Evolution toward the phase called ""full mobility"" provides incremental support for low latency, low packet loss and real-time handoff of subscriber terminals operating at high speeds. This paper presents the analogy of promising wireless technologies on different frequencies: Bluetooth, WiFi, and WiMAX. This paper is organised into four parts: part I describes the functionality and usage of Bluetooth in the wireless personal area networks, part II presents the WiFi- IEEE 802.1 In strategies for users considering higher-bandwidth alternatives to existing wireless personal area networks, part III discusses how the WiMAX is used as a current standard for Wireless data transmission technology, which is optimized to deliver high, bursty data rates to mobile subscribers, and to support real-time multimedia and Voice over IP (VoIP) applications, and part-TV explores how these emerging Wireless technologies differ from one another.",The 2nd International Conference on Wireless Broadband and Ultra Wideband Communications (AusWireless 2007),2007,,,14-14,"Dhawan, S.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093727364,32,

This study looks at policymakers’ dissemination of a National Cancer Institute (NCI) Web-based, preventive health education intervention to low-income people in Northern New Mexico and Southern Colorado through free Internet access. Although free public access Internet telecenters would appear to offer the potential of bridging these gaps, knowledge and information gaps persist because of the differentials between free and pay Internet access, as well as access through direct personal ownership of computers with Internet connections. The rate of increase of knowledge diffusion is much higher for individuals and communities of higher socioeconomic status who pay for access than for those with lesser means and who access free electronic resources. Pay-for-Internet cybercafes and free Internet telecenters have different accessibility thresholds, offer different user environments, and attract at least two different types of customers or clients. The socioeconomic differences in the two types of patrons are presented in this study by way of the results of an electronic user survey and a telecenter survey in the aforementioned project locales. While a learning and knowledge gap is evident between patrons of pay and free access sites, both types of public Internet access are, in relative terms, severely limited. Residually, a large knowledge gap persists among users of public access sites compared to computer owners with their own Internet connections. These disparities have implications for the dissemination of Web-based health information, particularly among the poor in minority communities. The Internet access evaluation is placed in the larger context of the NCI project, the Health Communication Intervention Research Initiative, looking (1) at broader concerns of cultural communications and policy and program implementation (2) across social and programmatic networks, with consideration to (3) pedagogical applications of the case in the MPA classroom.",Journal of Public Affairs Education,2006,12,2,213-232,"Medina, Una E.; Rivera, Mario A.; Rogers, Everett M.; Woodall, W.

pub.1041776260,10.4018/978-1-60566-026-4.ch262,Global Digital Divide,"Despite rapidly falling costs of hardware, software and telecommunications services, a wide gap persists between rich and poor nations in terms of their capabilities of accessing, delivering, and exchanging information in digital forms (Carter and Grieco, 2000). According to a report published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in 2006, a person in a high-income country was more than 22 times likely to use the Internet than someone in a low-income country (UNCTAD, 2006). The ratios were 29 times for mobile phones and 21 times for fixed phones. An estimate suggested that more than 95% of e-commerce transactions in 2003 were industrialized countries (Tedeschi, 2003). Another estimate suggested that 99.9% of business-to-consumer e-commerce in 2003 took place in the developed regions of North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific (Computer Economics, 2000). This is a form of commercial divide (UN Chronicle, 2003). Another estimate suggests that 80 percent of the global trade in high technology products originates from Europe, the U.S., and Japan (Bowonder, 2001) and 92 % of the patents granted in the world are owned by the members of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Archibugi and Iammarino, 2000). Whereas high-income countries have income 63 times that of low-income countries, the respective ratios are 97 for PCs, 133 for mobile phones, and over 2,100 for Internet hosts (Dholakia and Kshetri, 2003). While reliable data on e-commerce transactions are not available, the ratio is likely to be even higher for e-commerce transactions since e-commerce is virtually non-existent in many developing countries. The pattern indicates that the gap between developed and developing countries is wider for more recent technologies such as PC, mobile phone, and the Internet than for technologies which were introduced earlier. This article provides an assessment of three computer networks that redefine the conventional definition of market value by allowing developing nations and communities (Brooks, 2001) reap the benefits of modern ICTs: Global Trade Point Network (GTPNet) and Little Intelligent Communities (LINCOS).","Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, Second Edition",2009,,,1664-1670,"Khosrow-Pour, Mehdi; Kshetri, Nir; Dholakia, Nikhilesh",University of North Carolina at Greensboro; University of Rhode Island,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041776260,2,"[Goodman, S.; Press, L.; Ruth, S.; Rutkowski, A.]|[; ; ; ]|Communications of the ACM|1994|37|8|27-31|10.1145/179606.179733|pub.1000993278|60;[Carter, Chris; Grieco, Margaret]|[; ur.010706615761.80]|Urban Studies|2000|37|10|1735-1748|10.1080/00420980020080361|pub.1009715424|30;[Edejer, Tessa Tan-Torres]|[ur.01073101714.78]|The BMJ|2000|321|7264|797|10.1136/bmj.321.7264.797|pub.1014835973|166;[Hedley, R.

pub.1015613763,10.1145/1721654.1721693,Individual resistance to IT innovations,"Adoption of an information technology (IT) innovation is a much more attractive and frequently examined area to study than non-adoption. This is mainly due to the pro innovation bias that is found in the existing IT and information systems literature. Companies spend millions of dollars advertising their new gadgets to consumers. However, many IT innovations face varying degrees of resistance in their lifetime. An IT innovation is a product, practice, or process that relies extensively on technological advances such as computer hardware, computer software, and telecommunications. One of the most visible IT innovations is the personal computer (PC), which was introduced almost three decades ago. Factors such as age, income, and technological complexity are significant barriers to PC adoption. The presence of multiple computer households and the replacement of older machines can explain the continued annual sale of personal computers. Through PC adoption, the Web has also given birth, to many other innovative technologies such as, peer to peer networks, social computing, and mobile applications. Many of these innovations are targeted at individual users. In spite of the success of the personal computer, only 51% of U.S. households had at least one computer during the 2000 census. Factors such as income, education, and the digital divide all play a contributing role in the penetration of PCs in U.S. households. Further, the non-adoption of IT innovations is also influenced by factors associated with individual expectations and behaviors. The IT adoption literature has used ""intention to adopt"" as a reasonable proxy for actual adoption behavior and continued use of a technology. This is a very useful practice especially in an experimental setting or with early distribution of the product. Possibly, more important than the intention to adopt, is the intent 'not to adopt' a new technology. IT innovations are complex and content-sensitive and differ across a variety of factors including features, usability, and connectivity. If companies can better understand the non-adopter, they can use creative strategies to move such individuals into the adopter category, which can ultimately increase product visibility and revenue generation.",Communications of the ACM,2010,53,4,144-146,"Joseph, Rhoda C.",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015613763,32,"[Wei, Ran]|[]|Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly|2001|78|4|702-719|10.1177/107769900107800406|pub.1028872900|59;[Szmigin, Isabelle; Foxall, Gordon]|[ur.011013446723.09; ur.01365771022.19]|Technovation|1998|18|6-7|459-468|10.1016/s0166-4972(98)00030-3|pub.1041416036|147"
pub.1107182443,10.1787/5kml8rfg777l-en,Indicators of Broadband Coverage,"The aim of this report is to assist policy makers in providing an overview of how broadband physical coverage and availability can be measured. It first summarises what data are available from official and non-official sources. The approach taken by the report is to consider coverage and availability related to different types of technologies. These include Digital Subscriber Line (DSL or xDSL), cable networks (i.e. cable modem), Fibre to the Premises (i.e. FTTH/B for homes and businesses), 3G (including WCDMA and CDMA-2000), satellite and WiMAX technologies. This is because every technology capable of providing high speed Internet access involves specific issues when measuring coverage and availability. Accordingly, categorisation by technology is the most consistent way to approach this task. For every broadband technology, the available indicators will be presented, and this report discusses to what extent they are comparable. This report does not address metrics on the actual take-up of broadband services or penetration rates which are based on different measures and for which cross-country data are much more consistent. The report is aimed at providing information on the advantages and pitfalls of existing indicators used to measure broadband coverage. There is not necessarily a single indicator which should be used when assessing broadband coverage since this depends on what measures policy makers require: for example measuring the digital divide which may exist in a country, measuring the availability of broadband access for business, measuring broadband availability for residential customers, etc. There is no attempt in the paper to draw a conclusion as to the ideal indicator which should be used. However, it is important that OECD countries try to ensure a better consistency in the use of indicators to measure availability of broadband. The paper, in certain tables, lists all OECD countries even though they may be using different indicators to measure broadband coverage. The purpose in doing so is to show which indicators countries use and not to try and equate indicators that are by nature different.",,2009,,,,"Díaz-Pinés, Agustín",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107182443,4,
pub.1026335791,10.1108/01443570810895276,"E‐procurement in the United Nations: influences, issues and impact","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors influencing e‐procurement adoption in the United Nations (UN) system of organizations are examined.   Design/methodology/approach This paper reports on an extended multi‐method case study of e‐procurement in the UN. A three stage methodology is adopted – a questionnaire survey of UN organizations, case studies of e‐procurement issues in three UN organizations, and an interactive workshop with the heads of purchasing of UN organizations.   Findings The paper finds that e‐procurement is being used in the UN for transactions of routine, non‐strategic purchases. UN development agencies are more likely to adopt e‐procurement than humanitarian aid agencies as their operations are more predictable. The intention of the majority of UN organizations to adopt e‐procurement within three years has been reversed following the workshop, which revealed that adoption of e‐procurement would run counter to UN policies of supporting less developed nations, regions and organizations. A more cautious, “wait and see” approach has been taken rather than to unilaterally promote e‐procurement across the UN system.   Research limitations/implications This research focuses on the UN, yet could have implications for other complex systems of organizations such as the public sector, or multinational companies considering implementing e‐procurement with suppliers in developing countries.   Practical implications E‐procurement needs to be considered in the context of other procurement policy objectives. What may be good e‐procurement practice in a profit‐making firm may be viewed as competing with broader policy objectives of not‐for‐profit organizations. The digital divide is a salient contextual factor for the UN, and brings about unforeseen issues regarding e‐procurement adoption which may have resonance for other organisations.   Originality/value Much research on e‐procurement has been conducted in the private sector and this paper contributes to the small but growing number of studies of e‐procurement in the context of the public and not‐for‐profit sectors by studying e‐procurement in the UN.",International Journal of Operations & Production Management,2008,28,9,831-857,"Walker, Helen; Harland, Christine",University of Bath,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026335791,35,"[Liao, Shu-Hsien; Cheng, Ching-Hsue; Liao, Wei-Bang; Chen, I-Liang]|[ur.010451735365.36; ur.014416521145.65; ur.07436046102.46; ]|Technovation|2003|23|6|521-532|10.1016/s0166-4972(02)00006-8|pub.1001622296|29;[Dasgupta, Susmita; Lall, Somik; Wheeler, David]|[ur.07725533447.34; ur.016411736217.36; ]|Oxford Development Studies|2005|33|2|229-243|10.1080/13600810500137889|pub.1002252553|85;[Osmonbekov, Talai; Bello, Daniel C.; Gilliland, David I.]|[ur.015014004741.13; ur.011132705161.27; ur.010115365427.44]|Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing|2002|17|2/3|151-166|10.1108/08858620210419781|pub.1004595672|69;[Hartley, Janet L.; Lane, Michelle D.; Duplaga, Edward A.]|[ur.013552731500.94; ur.015645130615.91; ur.011153531133.07]|International Journal of Operations & Production Management|2006|26|2|202-221|10.1108/01443570610641675|pub.1004712993|29;[Frohlich, Markham T.]|[ur.012775345615.10]|Decision Sciences|2002|33|4|537-556|10.1111/j.1540-5915.2002.tb01655.x|pub.1005942830|240;[Croom, Simon R.]|[ur.015246675446.74]|International Journal of Operations & Production Management|2005|25|1|55-73|10.1108/01443570510572240|pub.1006232208|107;[Panayiotou, Nikolaos A.; Gayialis, Sotiris P.; Tatsiopoulos, Ilias P.]|[ur.07641562747.16; ur.010527353137.71; ur.01152437103.57]|International Journal of Production Economics|2004|90|1|79-102|10.1016/s0925-5273(03)00103-8|pub.1007432383|117;[Olhager, Jan; Selldin, Erik]|[ur.016277771257.22; ur.012433257131.51]|European Journal of Operational Research|2003|146|2|365-373|10.1016/s0377-2217(02)00555-6|pub.1008338765|146;[Lund, Mark J.

The South Pacific Region has many problems related to environmental and economic issues. The University of the South Pacific (USP) is an ideal platform for provision of development of Human Resources and enhancement of Human Security in the Pacific. Current dynamic Internet developments and continuous demand for the ubiquitous connectivity combined with the next generation of networks contributes towards creation the future cyberspace infrastructures worldwide. Implementation of the cyberspace in the government and corporate infrastructures, contributes towards creation of new paradigm in the decision making processes. Decisions that are currently governed by the human intelligence knowledge and intuition may be influenced by the cyber-data and processes. Future cyberspace will ultimately impact the decision making processes by government, corporate, industrial and academic institutions worldwide. Main objective of ICT Development is to build human-resource for ICT capacity development all across developing countries in the south pacific while “bridging the digital divide”. Main Goal was to provide the south pacific region with appropriate resources to take the lead role in driving the Pacific through Human Resource Development Programs. Specific Goal is to focus on developing and strengthening ICT skills applicable at the e-services level. The author discusses the development of new Japan Pacific Information Communications Technologies (ICT) Centre at the University of the South Pacific and ICT for Human Development and Security in the South Pacific Region. The main objective is to accommodate increasing demand for ICTrelated education and training in the region and to accelerate research and development activities in the Pacific. The ICT Centre will play a facilitator role for ICT related education, Training; and Research and Development for the Pacific. In conclusion the author promotes discussion on the role of the role of the ICT in the South Pacific Region.

pub.1026986423,10.1108/14779961111167630,"IT for a better future: how to integrate ethics, politics and innovation","Purpose The paper aims to explore future and emerging information and communication technologies. It gives a general overview of the social consequences and ethical issues arising from technologies that can currently be reasonably expected. This overview is used to present recommendations and integrate these in a framework of responsible innovation.   Design/methodology/approach The identification of emerging ICTs and their ethical consequences is based on the review and analysis if several different bodies of literature. The individual features of the ICTs and the ethical issues identified this way are then aggregated and analysed.   Findings The paper outlines the 11 ICTs identified. Some of the shared features that are likely to have social relevance include an increase in natural interaction, the invisibility of technology, direct links between humans and technology, detailed models and data of humans and an increasing autonomy of technology that may lead to power over the user. Ethical issues include several current topics such as privacy, data protection, intellectual property and digital divides. New problems may include changes to the way humans are perceived and the role of humans and technology in society. This includes changing power structures and different ways of treating humans.   Research limitations/implications The paper presents a piece of foresight research which cannot claim exact knowledge of the future. However, by developing a detailed understanding of possible futures it provides an important basis for current decisions relating to future technology development and governance.   Practical implications The paper spells out a range of recommendations for both policy makers and researchers/industry. These refer to the framework within which technology is developed and how such a framework could be designed to allow the development of ethical reflexivity.   Social implications The work described here is likely to influence EU policy on ICT research and technology research and innovation more broadly. This may have implications for the type of technologies funded and broad implications for the social use of emerging technologies.   Originality/value The paper presents a novel and important broad view of the future of ICTs that is required in order to inform current policy decisions.",Journal of Information Communication and Ethics in Society,2011,9,3,140-156,"Stahl, Bernd Carsten",De Montfort University,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026986423,44,"[Floridi, Luciano]|[ur.015031603611.12]|The Information Society|2007|23|1|59-64|10.1080/01972240601059094|pub.1010649691|119;[van Eck, Nees Jan; Waltman, Ludo]|[ur.011612755475.45; ur.01203665252.25]|Scientometrics|2009|84|2|523-538|10.1007/s11192-009-0146-3|pub.1018275818|5017;[Stahl, Bernd Carsten; Heersmink, Richard; Goujon, Philippe; Flick, Catherine; van den Hoven, Jeroen; Wakunuma, Kutoma; Ikonen, Veikko; Rader, Michael]|[ur.015337552312.43; ur.012055366131.19; ur.010476011475.03; ur.016661536425.41; ur.0576121205.37; ur.015346511117.30; ur.015010736167.53; ]|International Journal of Technoethics|2010|1|4|20-38|10.4018/jte.2010100102|pub.1021356907|36;[van Eck, Nees Jan; Waltman, Ludo]|[ur.011612755475.45; ur.01203665252.25]|Studies in Classification, Data Analysis, and Knowledge Organization|2007|||299-306|10.1007/978-3-540-70981-7_34|pub.1022631905|239;[Karafyllis, Nicole C.]|[ur.010241041165.80]|The International Library of Ethics, Law and Technology|2009|3||93-117|10.1007/978-90-481-2229-5_8|pub.1022997659|10;[Martin, Ben R.]|[ur.014544256205.43]|Technological Forecasting and Social Change|2010|77|9|1438-1447|10.1016/j.techfore.2010.06.009|pub.1030203306|132;[Grunwald, Armin]|[ur.012666201633.65]|NanoEthics|2010|4|2|91-101|10.1007/s11569-010-0088-5|pub.1034300159|59;[Moor, James H.]|[]|Information Technology and Moral Philosophy|2008|||26-39|10.1017/cbo9780511498725.003|pub.1040512800|19;[Cuhls, Kerstin]|[ur.07647045105.21]|Journal of Forecasting|2003|22|2‐3|93-111|10.1002/for.848|pub.1050681501|213;[Weizenbaum, Joseph; McCarthy, John]|[; ]|Physics Today|1977|30|1|68-71|10.1063/1.3037375|pub.1057897337|305;[Fischer, John Martin]|[]|Ethics|1999|110|1|93-139|10.1086/233206|pub.1058552071|277;[GRUNWALD, Armin]|[]|Ethische Perspectieven|1999|6|2|170-182|10.2143/ep.6.2.505355|pub.1069078453|44;[van Eck, Nees Jan; Waltman, Ludo; Janvanden, Berg]|[ur.011612755475.45; ur.01203665252.25; ]|16th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA'05)|2005|||405-409|10.1109/dexa.2005.23|pub.1095116803|13;[Stahl, Bernd Carsten]|[ur.015337552312.43]||2004||||10.4018/978-1-59140-172-8|pub.1096031184|22"
pub.1013269398,10.1145/1613858.1613973,Harnessing accelerometer technology for inclusive mobile learning,"The goal of this research is the establishment of a usable and accessible mobile learning system for the inclusion of both blind and vision-impaired students within mainstream education through independent, collaborative and ubiquitous mobile learning environments. An essential component of this work is the enhancement of the field to enable all students to work successfully together despite vision disabilities for the achievement of a learning outcome. Given the advancements in mobile technologies, and the personal nature of mobile devices, there is a lot to be gained, especially for the vision-impaired, by harnessing new technologies for education. Some technological advances can increase the divide between such students and their fully sighted peers. However the incorporation of technologies such as the accelerometer, now standard within many modern mobile phones, provides an opportunity to develop new inclusive mobile learning applications. The accelerometer could enable us to present a visionimpaired student with the capability to successfully play and interact directly with their fully sighted peers within a collaborative game to achieve a single outcome. This could be achieved without the heavy reliance on visual interfaces that were a necessary part of earlier mLearning models. The student would interact with the game through specific movements of their mobile handheld device. The device, for example, would be moved in one direction to give a specific command, while tilting and shaking the device would be used to command separate specific functions of the game. The student's interaction through the accelerometer could be enhanced through the provision of both haptic and audio feedback as they twist and tilt the handheld mobile device to interact with a learning game, removing altogether the need for the incorporation of a visual interface. The incorporation of wireless technologies such as Bluetooth, would allow for the provision of a collaborative environment for mobile learning, allowing all students to communicate via their handheld device, regardless of the disabilities faced by individual learners. Providing the ability to create an engaging, level playing field for such students could reduce the digital divide currently in existence for the future success of mobile learning environments.",Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services - MobileHCI '09,2009,,,100,"Mehigan, Tracey J.",University College Cork,Ireland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013269398,11,

A total of 90 urban impoverished women homeworkers and 40 sectoral stakeholders were interviewed. They are from different races, ages and types of home‐based work and included the chronically ill or those with physically and mentally challenged dependents. Focus group discussions, oral histories and case studies/observations offer insights of gender issues and glimpses into their otherwise invisible lives. Most homeworkers were initially ‘greened’ as ‘unskilled’ workers or cheap secondary labour in the mushrooming industries. They subsequently withdrew and entered home‐based work after marriage and childbirth. Many were spatially confined by their religious and traditional sense of duty and their responsibility to their family, especially disabled children. Others were restricted by their immobility in a disable unfriendly environment. Homeworking enables them to be economically productive and empowers them. However, due to their isolation, atomization, lack of recognition as ‘workers’ and inadequate safeguards to protect their welfare, many homeworkers, subcontracting from factories or selling through middlepersons, suffer from exploitation. Many assistance schemes of the Malaysian Government for vulnerable groups do not target homeworkers. Its heavy investment in ICT infrastructure has yet to narrow the digital divide. While all homeworkers have access to some form of ICT tools, many do not personally own the tools. Fewer have access to computer and Internet. Although they are aware of the potential of ICT for work, few explore its full potential because of their limited education, lack of literacy or their inability to demystify technology. Those supported by organisations have better access to training and utilize ICT tools in varying degrees for their work. They increase their clientele and widen their markets. With greater gender justice, these homeworkers will be able to transform gender relations and technology issues to be empowered to gain knowledge and use ICTs to access wider markets, skills and opportunities and uplift their lives and that of their families.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2007,32,1,1-14,"Loh‐Ludher, Lee Lee",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099630363,7,"[Standing, Guy]|[]|World Development|1989|17|7|1077-1095|10.1016/0305-750x(89)90170-8|pub.1045749766|398;[]|[]|Choice|1992|29|07|29-4214-29-4214|10.5860/choice.29-4214|pub.1073309827|175"
pub.1021118034,10.1108/073788309,Measuring the institution's footprint in the web,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide an alternative, although complementary, system for the evaluation of the scholarly activities of academic organizations, scholars and researchers, based on web indicators, in order to speed up the change of paradigm in scholarly communication towards a new fully electronic twenty‐first century model.   Design/methodology/approach In order to achieve these goals, a new set of web indicators has been introduced, obtained mainly from data gathered from search engines, the new mediators of scholarly communication.   Findings It was found that three large groups of indicators are feasible to obtain and relevant for evaluation purposes: activity (web publication); impact (visibility) and usage (visits and visitors). As a proof of concept, a Ranking Web of Universities has been built with Webometrics data. There are two relevant findings: ranking results are similar to those obtained by other bibliometric‐based rankings; and there is a concerning digital divide between North American and European universities, which appear in lower positions when compared with their USA and Canada counterparts.   Research limitations/implications Cybermetrics is still an emerging discipline, so new developments should be expected when more empirical data become available.   Practical implications The proposed approach suggests the publication of truly electronic journals, rather than digital versions of printed articles. Additional materials, such as raw data and multimedia files, should be included along with other relevant information arising from more informal activities. These repositories should be Open Access, available as part of the public web, indexed by the main commercial search engines. It is expected that these actions could generate larger web‐based audiences, reduce the costs of publication and access and allow third parties to take advantage of the knowledge generated, without sacrificing peer review, which should be extended (pre‐ and post‐) and expanded (closed and open).   Originality/value A full taxonomy of web indicators is introduced for describing and evaluating research activities, academic organizations and individual scholars and scientists.

Resulta impensable concebir una sociedad que no conozca en la teoría y en la práctica los lenguajes y las tecnologías de información y la comunicación; para lograr ese propósito es fundamental contar con software económicamente accesible. Hoy, gracias a la solidaridad planetaria, el software libre es una excelente opción, que está siendo utilizado con mucho éxito en varios países, en campos como la administración pública, la investigación y la enseñanza, entre otros. Además se menciona el proceso que ha seguido la Universidad de Costa Rica para hacer frente a este problema.   This topic review approaches the subject of free software as a strategy for dealing with the demands of the software companies and the high prices of commercially available software. Conceiving a society that does not know the languages and technology of the information era in theory or in practice is now unthinkable; to achieve this today, the access to affordable software is indispensable. Recently, thanks to planetary solidarity, free software is an excellent option; successfully used in many countries and in fields such as public management, research and teaching, among others.

pub.1001434559,10.1108/14636691111101865,Restricted mobility and fixed‐mobile convergence in Brazil,"Purpose  This article aims to explore the impact of a particular regulatory framework for CDMA and GSM use by fixed‐phone companies in Brazil on access, local‐loop competition and fixed‐mobile convergence.    Design/methodology/approach  The paper is based on the analysis of the three most significant cases in Brazil and the discussion of recent regulatory changes that facilitate access to radio spectrum on a secondary basis.    Findings  Among the findings of the study is that while fixed‐wireless access (FWA) systems using CDMA seem to be more suitable to high‐density, well‐served areas, in which a large operator attempts to address a low‐income market satisfied with restricted mobility – GSM systems deployed on a secondary basis are best fitted to address the digital gap in low‐income, underserved areas, promoting local‐loop competition in markets of little interest to traditional operators.    Practical implications  The conclusion outlines regulatory recommendations for promoting competition and the growth of innovative, small‐scale operators that take advantage of new wireless technologies to address service coverage gaps.    Originality/value  The paper presents the first attempt to address the Brazilian CDMA‐ and GSM‐based fixed wireless access experience from a regulatory perspective and analyzes the “ruralfone” case, which uses a fixed phone license to deliver GSM‐based services in underserved communities, surpassing incumbent penetration in cities where there is no cellular network yet under a given regulatory environment in Brazil.",Info,2011,13,1,32-42,"Aranha, Márcio; Galperin, Hernán; Bar, François; Villela, Marina",University of Southern California,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001434559,1,"[Frempong, Godfred]|[ur.01044026755.48]|Info|2009|11|2|79-94|10.1108/14636690910941902|pub.1005347234|24;[Tan, Zixiang; Chen, Hsiang; Liu, Xiaozhong]|[ur.014712572367.13; ; ]|Info|2006|8|6|69-78|10.1108/14636690610707491|pub.1008718285|4;[Mariscal, Judith]|[ur.07365701451.47]|Info|2009|11|2|24-41|10.1108/14636690910941867|pub.1020619584|8;[Trinkwon, David]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1997|21|5|437-450|10.1016/s0308-5961(97)00017-7|pub.1024954659|1;[Pereira-Filho, José Leite]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|2003|27|5-6|333-350|10.1016/s0308-5961(03)00008-9|pub.1026342015|4;[Weiss, Martin]|[]|Info|2006|8|2|74-82|10.1108/14636690610653608|pub.1040294707|11;[Galperin, Hernan; Bar, François]|[ur.010322365021.09; ur.010701270553.44]|Information Technologies and International Development|2007|3|2|73-86|10.1162/itid.2007.3.2.73|pub.1063351766|24;[Mannisto, H.; Tuisku, K.]|[; ]|Proceedings of 1994 International Conference on Personal Wireless Communications|1994|||37-39|10.1109/icpwc.1994.567909|pub.1094711210|2;[Haugen, R.B.; Olsen, B.T.; Eskedal, B.E.]|[ur.013661443143.62; ur.013416240003.02; ur.015254404143.54]|Proceedings of 1994 International Conference on Personal Wireless Communications|1994|||17-24|10.1109/icpwc.1994.567905|pub.1095135025|2"
pub.1095749632,10.1109/iceit.2010.5607641,The Implementation of Government Information Systems and Computer Education within Aboriginal Community In Australia,"Information and Communications Technology (ICT) can be used as a catalyst for economic and social development in the modern society. It can be used to improve the economic and social living conditions of the society at large or even a section of it. In the 21st Digital Century businesses, non-profit organisations, and governments around the world are relying on ICT for achieving its aims and obligations towards the society and stakeholders. This study looks at the implementation of information technology and information systems by government organisations in Australia in relation to the development of the Indigenous population in the country. Studies such as done by Taylor (2004), show that ICT should be used as a tool, not only for commercial ventures, but for the overall development of the society. It can be seen that the indigenous population in the country is seen as a separate social class and the teaching syllabus is based on the assumption that they are not equipped to become a part of the mainstream Australian society. The paper shows that there is enough literature to provide that an ICT infrastructure can provide a strong foundation for the development of any society or class in any country. This implies that ICT can be used for the overall development of the Indigenous community also. In this context, it is essential that all the stakeholders involved, including the Indigenous community be involved in the development an information technology infrastructure. Moreover, a networked system whereby relevant knowledge is made available to its members should also be put in place. The government should make attempts to preserve the Indigenous knowledge developed over centuries using ICT. There are also issues of commoditization of Indigenous knowledge, culture, and art by unscrupulous entrepreneurs. There is also an apparent digital divide with regard to the usage of information technology when comparing the Indigenous population and the immigrants in Australia. The current educational system shows that school dropouts among the Indigenous population are also high in comparison. This study is intended to create a situation where ICT can be implemented for the overall and sustainable development of the Indigenous community in Australia.

pub.1022887684,10.4018/978-1-87828-991-9.ch113,The Cross-Cultural Dimension of Gender and Information Technology,"The underrepresentation of women in the information technology (IT) sector has been widely studied in the contexts of western countries such as North American and Western European countries. These studies indicate that the underrepresentation of women in the IT sector is unveiled in multiple perspectives, including IT access, the development, adoption and use of IT, IT education, and the IT workforce in general and within the IT workforce structure itself (e.g., different levels of IT positions) (Cooper & Weaver, 2003; Gürer & Camp, 2002; Hartzel, 2003; Klein, Jiang & Tesch, 2002; Margolis & Fisher, 2002; Rommes, 2002; Trauth, 2002; von Hellens, Neilsen, & Beekhuyzen, 2001; Webster, 1996). Why is it important to study issues related to gender and information technology? First, it is argued that the information technology sector should value and leverage all kinds of diversity (including gender diversity as one dimension) to enhance productivity, to facilitate IT innovation, and to develop IT for a wide variety of people (Avgerou, 2002; Roberts, 2003; Trauth, Huang, Morgan, Quesenberry, & Yeo, 2006). Second, it is also argued that women’s underrepresentation in and exclusion from information technology can be attributed to power and socio-cultural reproduction of inequality through technology development and use, and the historically socialconstruction of technology fields as “masculine” domains, which result in a gendered digital divide (Cockburn, 1985; Kvasny & Trauth, 2002; Kvasny & Truex, 2001; Wajcman, 1991, 2004; Woodfield, 2000). Ignorance or failure to address issues related to gender and IT will further marginalize women’s participation in future economic and social development, and will endanger social equality and social welfare in general (Kvasny & Trauth, 2002). A significant trend of the contemporary information technology industry is towards globalization, which is manifested through a variety of established practices such as IT offshore outsourcing, global software development, and innovation through global R&D (research & design) collaboration (Sahay, Nicholson, & Krishna, 2003; Walsham, 2000, 2001, 2002). Such a globalization trend of the IT industry and market has put forward new challenges to gender and IT research, to incorporate the cross-cultural dimension. Similar to the rationale for studying gender and IT in developed countries (leveraging diversity and improving social inclusion), Hafkin and Taggart (2001) argued that it is imperative to examine the cultural factors while studying gender and IT in developing countries",Human Computer Interaction,2009,,,1753-1760,"Ang, Chee Siang; Zaphiris, Panayiotis; Huang, Haiyan",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022887684,0,
pub.1022656591,10.1108/02640470610689197,Development of a web‐based self‐training package for information retrieval using the distance education approach,"The purpose of this project was to develop a web‐based self‐training package for information retrieval using the distance education approach. The package was developed using the distance education approach with STOU Plan, STOU Plan 2000 and GMS‐VU applied. The distance education model for the web‐based self‐training package was composed of five stages: identifying the learners, design of the package, production of the package, establishing the delivery system, and evaluation. The system development methodology was based on the system development lifecycle (SDLC) with a combination of waterfall, phased and prototyping approaches. There are several phase in SDLC to carry out: problem and objective identification, requirement determination, requirement analysis, package design, package implementation, delivery system and evaluation. Evaluation of the package was conducted in two phases: formative evaluation and summative evaluation using the focus group discussion method. Formative evaluation was conducted during the package development by experts in the field prior to the summative evaluation. The summative evaluation was conducted after the package development had been completed as a pilot study for field trial by target users, consisting of junior library staff and library users. All comments were reviewed and refined in terms of instructional content, design, overall opinion and learning progress before put on production. The package consists of three main components: About the project, Study modules, References and further readings. Study modules, which is the most important component, consists of ten instructional modules focusing on information retrieval, and self‐assessment through pre‐test and post‐test. The package includes multimedia such as images and sound to attract learners during their learning session. The delivery mode for the self‐training package offers both online and off‐line modes. Online mode is offered when there is network facility and internet connection available, while offline mode is offered through CD‐ROM without requiring network and internet connection. The features and functions of both modes are identical. Moreover, print materials are also included as supplementary media. Since the module is a self‐directed learning or self‐training tool in information retrieval it can be employed for junior library staff and library users; it provides a training tool for librarians to train library users and supports human resource and development to narrow digital divides and support the right to access information.",The Electronic Library,2006,24,4,501-516,"Sacchanand, Chutima; Jaroenpuntaruk, Vipa",Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University,Thailand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022656591,11,"[RIGGS, DONALD E.]|[]|College & Research Libraries|1997|58|3|208-209|10.5860/crl.58.3.208|pub.1007174750|6;[Vishwanatham, Rama; Wilkins, Walter; Jevec, Thomas]|[ur.014250541367.81; ; ur.013623556307.28]|College & Research Libraries|1997|58|5|433-444|10.5860/crl.58.5.433|pub.1008755769|14;[Cavanagh, Anthony K.]|[ur.07666002763.43]|Journal of Library Administration|2001|31|3-4|149-166|10.1300/j111v31n03_13|pub.1012867961|3;[Stoker, David]|[]|Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|1995|27|1|3-5|10.1177/096100069502700101|pub.1018539580|3;[Peters, Otto]|[]|Open Learning The Journal of Open Distance and e-Learning|1989|4|3|3-8|10.1080/0268051890040302|pub.1021594670|37;[Dhanarajan, Gajaraj]|[ur.015125240653.54]|Open Learning The Journal of Open Distance and e-Learning|2001|16|1|61-68|10.1080/02680510124465|pub.1023891966|36;[DRAGULANESCU, NICOLAE-GEORGE]|[ur.015340644563.92]|The International Information & Library Review|2002|34|3|247-254|10.1006/iilr.2002.0205|pub.1035224732|47;[Brown, Cecelia M.]|[ur.011770560463.97]|College & Research Libraries|1999|60|5|426-438|10.5860/crl.60.5.426|pub.1039988065|28;[Caspers, Jean; Fritts, Jack; Gover, Harvey]|[ur.013323271061.37; ; ur.013005662745.51]|Journal of Library Administration|2001|31|3-4|127-148|10.1300/j111v31n03_12|pub.1041274300|6;[Sacchanand, Chutima]|[ur.011717531261.13]|IFLA Journal|1999|25|2|97-100|10.1177/034003529902500206|pub.1046231319|2;[Casey, Des]|[]|ACM SIGCSE Bulletin|1998|30|3|51-54|10.1145/290320.283018|pub.1048985704|4"

Typical objectives of electronic voting are to enhance security and to grant easy accessibility. Security can be pursued by means of several strategies oriented to secrete the vote, to check the voter identity, to decouple the voter from his choice and to allow the ballot to be audited. On the other hand, accessibility too can be greatly improved by providing the opportunity to vote remotely or by using voting machines, located at polling stations, equipped with appropriate interfaces for disabled people.In this paper a Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) based voting system is presented. This kind of electronic voting technology allows disabled users (especially people with mobility problems), but not only, to cast their vote from home and, above all, by using common well-known devices. In fact, the needed basic equipment are a TV set, a Set Top Box (STB) with its remote control and a telephone line. The complete infrastructure consists of an MHP (Multimedia Home Platform) application that acts as a client application; a server application that acts as a network/counting server for e-voting; and a security protocol based on asymmetric key encryption to ensure authentication and secrecy of the vote. The MHP application is broadcasted by a certified (e.g. national) TV channel that grants its originality. The user needs a smart card issued by a national authority (e.g. the electronic identity card) to authenticate himself to the application and to sign the encrypted ballot to send to the server application. The voter can simply browse the application, displayed on his TV screen, by acting on the STB remote control. The server application is in charge to verify user identity, to gather and store user’s encrypted ballots and finally to count votes. The communication between the client application and the server takes place by means of a secured channel (using HTTPS), established over the common telephone line, while the voting operations are secured with the help of asymmetric keys encryption. The whole infrastructure has been proven in laboratory tests and also in a public demonstration for USA Presidential Election on 2008 November 4th.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2009,305,,13-25,"Caldelli, Roberto; Becarelli, Rudy; Filippini, Francesco; Picchioni, Francesco; Giorgetti, Riccardo",University of Florence,Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046962457,0,"[Garera, Sujata; Rubin, Aviel D.]|[ur.011626543555.84; ur.01202677520.79]|Proceedings of the 14th ACM conference on Computer and communications security  - CCS '07|2007|||256-265|10.1145/1315245.1315278|pub.1042682152|11;[Chaum, D.]|[ur.016170202225.46]|IEEE Security & Privacy|2004|2|1|38-47|10.1109/msecp.2004.1264852|pub.1061421879|224;[Chaum, David; Essex, Aleks; Carback, Richard; Clark, Jeremy; Popoveniuc, Stefan; Sherman, Alan; Vora, Poorvi]|[ur.016170202225.46; ur.015247277115.45; ur.07553275450.34; ur.010653745371.06; ur.015241444155.69; ur.015601434643.36; ur.011574564272.60]|IEEE Security & Privacy|2008|6|3|40-46|10.1109/msp.2008.70|pub.1061423064|121"
pub.1027059346,10.1108/10650741111181607,Enhancing the quality of e‐learning through mobile technology,"Purpose This paper aims to present part of the work of an ongoing research project that is looking at socio‐ cultural and technological developments from a mobile technology convergence view; in order to show how culturally aware convergence developments in mobile technology can be adopted and employed for the betterment of society.   Design/methodology/approach The paper presents a scenario for a mobile technology enabled learning environment in support of the conventional learning approach with a focus on enabling parental involvement and contribution to the daily learning objectives of their children and hence enhancing a quality learning experience. It further critically discusses issues of interface design – at both the device and application levels – that will have an impact on the quality of e‐learning, with a focus on mobile technology.   Findings The paper shows how interface design can positively enhance the quality defining characteristics of learning in an e‐learning environment. Ways of achieving these characteristics of learning through effective e‐learning are reported. This is done by addressing requirements for quality‐learning through effective interface‐design considerations, towards meeting the overall quality requirements of learning that should be intrinsic to a holistic e‐learning environment. The value of human computer interaction and the critical factors of promoting productive interaction are addressed.   Research limitations/implications There are several factors affecting quality of e‐learning as a tool and approach to flexible and independent learning. The advent and use of mobile technology has been investigated in this work from a socio‐cultural and technological perspectives in two continents. The limitations lie in the depth of investigations and how far the findings can be applied to the diversity of learners.   Practical implications As the effects of cultures and the rapid technological advancements take toll on teaching and learning the findings reported in this paper have far reaching implications for learners from different cultures and also for attempts at bridging existing digital divide.   Originality/value The approach adopted in the research is unique by virtue of new findings and ideas presented.

pub.1115132138,10.11444/sisj1986.2000.111,情報化の産業・社会へのインパクト,"It has taken quite a while for “informatization” to progress, yet currently, it is expanding at an alarming pace. “Informatization” is the intensive utilization of IT, Information Technology. At present, the contributing boosting factors of “Informatization” are realized through both supply and demand components; namely, the expansion of Information Technology, widespread use of the Internet, and the introduction of re-engineering, mainly by corporate enterprises of developed countries. “Informatization” will ultimately resolve into a network society which will run close to a “perfect marketplace”, where information is passed on instantly-ignoring the time/space constraint-at low cost. As a result, intermediary business agents that evolved from the information gap as an added-value will lose existence value, and hence disappear, while optimization of global procurement of materials and components will be made possible, thereby, increasing efficiency in procurement and sales. Furthermore, consumer lifestyles will change. Therefore, companies are expected to face up to the evolution of a network society and approach business expansion accordingly. The biggest problem facing the network society is the digital divide. Moreover, a new type of Information Appliance is in demand for this network society-one with easy operation along with high quality network capability and digital security-which will take over the role of personal computers. In Japan, as part of corporate reform strategies, investment in IT is in full swing. In fact, IT investment is said to be the driving force behind Japan's capital investment. In addition to IT investments by corporate enterprises, “informatization” is accelerated by widespread use of the Internet, and furthermore, new stock exchange markets have been set up, all resulting in the emergence of Internet-related entrepreneurs in Japan. This phenomenon is expected to stimulate the industry and economy of Japan, which has been suffering from post-bubble stagnation. Yet on the other hand, “Internet-bubble” is a new phrase that has emerged up recently, indicating that this may end up as a one-off trend. “Informatization” itself is irreversible; therefore, deregulation, for example, is needed to encourage further entrepreneurs entering the market, and appropriate management of the newly opening stock market is expected, all in an effort to stop this becoming a one-off boom. The future of 21st century Japan depends on whether or not Japan can adapt into the network society.

pub.1072500624,10.4314/udslj.v9i1.26660,"Gender Analysis Of Electronic Information Resource Use: The Case Of The University Of Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania","This article is based on an empirical study that examined the association between gender and the use of electronic information resources among postgraduate students at the University of Dar es salaam, Tanzania. The study was conducted in December 2005 and integrated both qualitative and quantitative research designs. A sample of 100 postgraduate students was selected using a stratified proportionate random sampling procedure with a 97% response rate. Face to face interviews was the major technique of data collection. In addition, focus group discussions (FGDS), key informant interviews, analysis of records and observations were employed in data collection. Data analysis involved the use of cross-tabulation and qualitative descriptions. Findings revealed that gender is associated with the use of electronic information resources and male postgraduate students were more likely to use electronic information resources than female students. Results further showed that even when we controlled for attitude toward the use of electronic information resources or training in the use of e-resources the relationship between gender and electronic information resource use was maintained. Other variables that were found to have positive association with the use of electronic information resources included: training in the use of electronic information resources, access to e-resources, awareness of the availability of resources and year of study. Generally this study revealed that the use of electronic databases and electronic journals among postgraduate students is low although the use of internet search engines such as google, yahoo and other free internet resources was found to be high and frequent. Specifically, female students faired low in the use of electronic information resources. Based on the findings the study concluded that access and use of electronic information resources creates a “social digital divide” along gender lines. The study recommends that: high speed internet connectivity be made available to postgraduate students; and establish computer rooms for female graduate students which are conveniently located. Design and implement free literacy classes for female postgraduate students for capacity building. Develop web site for postgraduate students and a listserv for postgraduate female students only. Computer labs at the University should keep gender disaggregated statistics in the use of electronic information resources. Finally, the library needs to change its marketing strategies on the availability of electronic information resources to increase awareness of these resources.

pub.1027549948,10.4018/978-1-59904-947-2.ch078,"Drop the ""e""","This chapter was prepared originally for the 2002 Task Force of the OECD Project on the Impact of E-Government and was updated in 2004 for inclusion in the book, Practicing E-Government: A Global Perspective. The chapter addresses the risk of low public awareness and declining political interest as barriers to e-government, and considers ways governments can develop better marketing techniques to “sell” online services and the e-government concept to both groups. The term “marketing” is used loosely to mean both the presentation and promotion of actual online services to encourage people to use them, and the presentation and promotion of the theory and concept of e-government to ensure political understanding of its benefits to society. The chapter has two parts plus an initial Executive Summary that summarizes the points raised in both sections. Part A discusses demand-side issues: the lack of awareness and confusion among users and potential users of electronic services and how these issues can be addressed with various marketing techniques. While the greatest factor contributing to low take-up of electronic services continues to be poor Internet access and a lack of computer skills, the purpose of this report is not to address social exclusion issues. It is recognized that the digital divide is gradually being bridged and therefore the chapter primarily considers the person who has access to a computer but, for a variety of reasons, does not use it to access government services. Part B looks at the supply side and ways to market the concept of e-government to decision-makers — politicians and senior level bureaucrats — who are responsible for supporting and funding the development of online services and for removing remaining regulatory and legal barriers. The chapter does not address culture change within the public sector and the need to shift the mindset of government employees from traditional department-centric thinking into more customer-centric and user-friendly approaches. Overcoming employee resistance to new working methods requires more management skills than marketing skills. But marketing techniques can be used to address the risk of a backlash against e-government as declining political interest in the Internet generally and in e-government specifically coincides with the need to develop more complex and expensive electronic services and information systems.

pub.1050821935,10.1108/14684520510628909,Revolutionising the voting process through online strategies,"Purpose To provide practitioners of information management with an overview and framework to explore the various controversies associated with the methods of traditional methods of voting with electronically enhanced voting via the internet (I‐voting). The current paper is centered on the assumption that I‐voting is the next logical step in applying online information‐gathering and retrieval technologies to the field of e‐government.   Design/methodology/approach A review of the applied literature on electronically enhanced voting methods with potentials associated with internet voting, as well as from practical experience, resulted in a basic model for discussion of the emergent nature of I‐voting.   Findings I‐voting would reduce the cost for staffing polling stations, and also the funds needed to pay for voting machines. I‐voting could also reduce the number of errors made by both the voters and the electoral administrators, and allow for easier adoption of uniform standards in the ballot format, since it could be transmitted via the internet from a central election agency to all local and regional polling places. Bridging the digital divide and internet security issues may be the most important barriers that must be overcome if I‐voting becomes a viable option in the USA.   Research limitations/implications It may be years, if ever, before a truly secure, relatively risk‐free internet service, such as I‐voting, is developed. However, despite the controversies associated with election fraud, the numerous current voting systems that are in place suffer from the same problems associated with online informational exchanges; but, for the most part, nations still conduct their businesses and the political systems are still relatively stable.   Practical implications Owing to recent voting débâcles in the USA, the public is demanding a more reliable and secure method of voting. Currently, many nations are moving more toward electronically enhanced voting methods with the long‐term goal being internet voting. Unfortunately, there are heated debates about the pros and cons of handing over the right to vote, using a system that is prone to security risks from outside sources.   Originality/value In the short term, there should be increased interest in establishing national and international standards for testing and certification of electronic and I‐voting systems and their IT‐infrastructure. It is a basic premise of the present study that voting online increases voter participation, which can only be viewed in a positive light.",Online Information Review,2005,29,5,513-530,"Smith, Alan D.; Clark, John S.",Robert Morris University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050821935,12,"[Gefen, David; Rose, Gregory M.; Warkentin, Merrill; Pavlou, Paul A.]|[ur.010724440512.07; ur.012601410205.94; ur.014404213724.32; ur.016166254325.43]|Journal of Global Information Management|2005|13|1|54-78|10.4018/jgim.2005010103|pub.1003512069|110;[Smith, Alan D.; Rupp, William T.]|[ur.015062661765.66; ur.016455622765.36]|Information Management & Computer Security|2002|10|4|178-183|10.1108/09685220210436976|pub.1007192953|49;[GIBSON, RACHEL]|[]|Political Science Quarterly|2001|116|4|561-583|10.2307/798221|pub.1010471932|60;[Smith, Alan D.; Rupp, William T.]|[ur.015062661765.66; ur.016455622765.36]|Services Marketing Quarterly|2003|25|1|47-74|10.1300/j396v25n01_04|pub.1025419024|4;[Rubin, Aviel D.]|[ur.01202677520.79]|Communications of the ACM|2002|45|12|39-44|10.1145/585597.585599|pub.1030184287|80;[Kawalek, Peter; Wastall, David]|[ur.010652275447.99; ur.010150047173.08]|Journal of Global Information Management|2005|13|1|79-101|10.4018/jgim.2005010104|pub.1032524137|30;[Smith, Alan D.; Rupp, William T.]|[ur.015062661765.66; ur.016455622765.36]|Information Management & Computer Security|2002|10|2|64-72|10.1108/09685220210424113|pub.1033775264|41;[Smith, Alan D.; Rupp, William T.]|[ur.015062661765.66; ur.016455622765.36]|Services Marketing Quarterly|2004|25|3|53-75|10.1300/j396v25n03_04|pub.1039409748|13;[Phillips, Deborah M.; von Spakovsky, Hans A.]|[; ]|Communications of the ACM|2001|44|1|73-ff.|10.1145/357489.357512|pub.1045705328|28;[Tan, Chee-Wee; Pan, Shan L.; Lim, Eric T.K.]|[ur.010575342171.01; ur.014246137254.98; ur.016667225543.30]|Journal of Global Information Management|2005|13|1|31-53|10.4018/jgim.2005010102|pub.1047237663|88;[Grant, Gerald; Chau, Derek]|[ur.014437343351.01; ur.013304476217.26]|Journal of Global Information Management|2005|13|1|1-30|10.4018/jgim.2005010101|pub.1050886570|144"

Today consumers are looking for a single device capable of fulfilling their daily communication, computing, and personal productivity application needs. Businesses are working tirelessly to offer enhanced quality of service and application portability to consumers irrespective of their locality, mobility, and system preferences. These user preferences squarely challenge existence of stovepipe platforms, islands of interoperable systems, centralized command and control structure, and fragmented connectivity landscape. The new paradigm is all about being technology, platform, operating system, and network agnostic. There are clear indications, which confirms this transformation - e.g. connectivity migrating form circuit switched to packet switched, system resources and application transitioning from centralized to distributed (e.g. thin client, P2P), applications becoming platform and operating systems agnostic (e.g. Java applets), fixed and mobile convergence (IP centric - IMS), and aggregation of voice, data, and video (triple play).This paradigm shift brings challenges and opportunities to system developers and raises the threshold of entry. To become a successful player in this new world one needs to understand the full value chain of the new ecosystem. The existing base of deployed system, equipments, and hierarchies can’t be overhauled overnight due to business, political, and regulatory reasons and one need to work in the confine of these constraints. Coexistence and collaboration across the heterogeneous systems and platforms need to be evaluated and commonality across must be exploited. We have to take advantage of the recent advancements in VLSI, system integration, and signal processing technologies. The mobile industry has been in the forefront and enabler of this transformation. They have taken full advantage of Moore’s law in integrating myriad of complementary applications such as WLAN, BT, 3D gaming, GPS, camera, audio/video streaming, and personal productivity gadgets to name a few. And this all has been done under the constraints of the device size and battery power. It is no coincidence that today’s mobile device deliver the capabilities of PC of yester years.There has been a lot of progress already made towards the global convergence but more needs to be done. If current trend continues then there is a safe bet to say that today’s mobile evolution would be able to reduce the “digital divide” for the human kind globally.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2007,4516,,5-5,"Jha, Uma S.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007606834,0,
pub.1002228281,10.1145/1693042.1693074,Managing rural citizen interfaces in e-governance systems: a study in Indian context,"In business parlance, management of ""user interfaces"" is one of the most challenging tasks for the organizations using information and communication technologies (ICT). Despite prolific advances in ICT, maturity in development of innovative ICT enabled tools for business processes, challenges of managing user expectations are still many. Dimensions of such challenges are quite diverse in the e-governance parlance as well. In most of the nations today, government systems are gradually and effectively embracing ICT in various forms to provide simple, moral, accountable, responsive and transparent (SMART) governance for their citizens. These governments are also facing challenges similar to the enterprises because of the same unique reason i.e. ""user interface"". Indian government systems are quite aggressively incorporating ICT enabled government processes to provide SMART governance in the country. National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) is formulated to provide the required support. NeGP recognizes ""citizen interface"" as an important link in the delivery system. Drawing experiences of ""user interface"" and its effect in successful implementations for enterprise wide ICT enabled processes and services; it is quite relevant that ""citizens"" are the most critical ""users"" in the e-governance systems. In Indian context, this carries enormous challenge to cater to the varied needs of rural citizens who are influenced by diverse socio-economic conditions and digital divides. Thus there is a need to study this important ""citizen interface"" issue. In this paper, it is argued that in addition to SMART governance systems, a demand driven ""citizen interface"" would enhance the success of e-governance services in India. Since a large section of India resides in rural areas, successful ""citizen interface"" is mostly contingent upon provisioning of demand driven services in these areas. Rural citizens in India reside in villages and their aggregated needs do not reflect adequately at the state and/or national level. However, various common services including e-governance services are rendered at the village level based on the policies framed at state/national level. Therefore, it is important that gross national estimates of demand on e-governance systems should also take cognizance of individual household needs. In this paper, a framework is presented to understand the citizen interface issues, identify the factors responsible for demand assessment and influencing access to e-governance services. This framework also aims to discuss contributors to a successful e-governance set up in the village on a sustainable basis. Two cases are discussed to examine the underpinnings of the framework.",Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance - ICEGOV '09,2009,,,155-162,"Misra, Harekrishna",Institute of Rural Management Anand,India,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002228281,7,"[Misra, D.

South Africa is Botswana's neighbor and both countries are leading economies in Africa.   Design/methodology/approach The paper draws on a survey that was carried out in information communication technology (ICT)‐intensive government ministries in Botswana in May 2008. The study sought to establish availability of policy framework, level of usage of open source software, government support, motivations for implementing open source software in government, availability of skills, attitude of it managers in government toward open source software and challenges of open source software deployment in the public sector. The population of the study consisted of information technology (IT) managers who were purposively selected from ICT‐intensive government ministries and interviewed. The study was extended to cover South Africa through review of literature on the same issues as those studied in Botswana.   Findings Compared with other countries in developed and developing countries including South Africa, there is limited use of open source software in the public sector in Botswana. However, IT managers in government of Botswana demonstrate a positive attitude toward open source software, and seem to have adequate understanding of its potential benefits. Comparatively, South African government provides support for harnessing open source software; awareness among top government officials is high and attitude toward open source software seems positive; skills are generally available and hardly any challenges of using open source software were identified.   Research limitations/implications This study was limited to purposively selected government ministries which are ICT‐intensive in Botswana, while for South Africa, the study was based on secondary sources of data and focused on deployment of open source software in government agencies.   Practical implications Despite the increasing deployment of open source software in government across the world, the Botswanan government is yet unlikely to put in place an enabling open source software policy to harness the potential of the Software.   Originality/value Open source software deployment in government across the world is gaining momentum purportedly to enhance universal access, reduce costs associated with commercial software bridge the digital divide, grow indigenous IT skills, etc. Botswana and South Africa are the economic frontline states in Africa, and their leadership role in this matter among counterparts on the African continent is pertinent.",Library Hi Tech,2010,28,1,63-80,"Mutula, Stephen; Kalaote, Tumelo",University of Zululand; University of Botswana,South Africa; Botswana,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043641198,18,[]|[]|The Success of Open Source|2004||||10.4159/9780674044999|pub.1144928218|219

It is widely accepted that men tend to be the first to use new technologies and to gain significant benefits from doing so, both at home and work. However, further research on gender and new technologies, such as ICTs, is still needed in order to better understand differences between men and women. On the one hand we show that percentage of ICTs users is higher among men. On the other hand, our results confirm that women also present lower frequency of ICTs use. We examine how the differences in adoption and use of ICTs are moderated by cultural and socioeconomic aspects. Differences appear mainly in the lower levels of education and in the rural area. Therefore, it highlights the necessity of taking into account those aspects to remove the gender digital divide totally. We also underline the importance of changes in gender roles and the increase of the participation of women in the Spanish labour force. El objetivo principal de este trabajo es analizar el impacto del gnero en la adopcin y utilizacin de las tecnologas de la informacin y la comunicacin (TIC) en Espaa. Est generalmente aceptado que los hombres tienden a ser los primeros en usar las nuevas tecnologas y en obtener ventajas significativas de ello, tanto en el hogar como en el trabajo. Sin embargo, sigue siendo necesarios nuevos estudios sobre la relacin entre el gnero y las nuevas tecnologas, como las TIC, para entender mejor las diferencias entre hombres y mujeres. Por un lado, se observa que el porcentaje de usuarios de las TIC es ms alto entre los hombres. Por otro lado, nuestros resultados confirman que las mujeres tambin presentan menor frecuencia de uso de las TIC. Se muestra tambin como las diferencias de adopcin y uso de las TIC son moderadas por aspectos culturales y socioeconmicos. Las diferencias aparecen principalmente en los niveles inferiores de educacin y en las reas rurales.

pub.1139273782,10.29173/irie18,Information Rights: Trust and Human Dignity in e-Government,"The words - Rights, - Trust, - Human Dignity, - and even - Government - have widely varying meanings and connotations, differing across time, languages and cultures. Concepts of rights, trust, and human dignity have been examined for centuries in great depth by ethicists and other philosophers and by religious think-ers, and more recently by social scientists and, especially as related to information, by information scientists. Similarly, discussions of government are well documented in writings back to Plato and Aristotle, with investi-gations of electronic government (often referred to as e-government) dating back only to the early 1990s with the advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web. At first e-government was described in glowing, positive terms. Little, if any, attention was paid to two critical questions: 1) Will people trust e-government? and 2) How will cultural differences affect individuals‘ trust in government and their perceptions of govern-ment‘s effect of their human dignity? Examinations of trust and distrust by individuals within organizations have addressed questions of motives and intentions, expectations of behavior, protection of interests, confi-dence in accuracy and reliability of information, vulnerability, and reciprocity, among other complex topics. Establishing e-government services often requires going through several phases: 1) publish (using ICT to improve access to government information), 2) interact (broadening participation in government through 2-way communications, and 3) transact (making actual services available online; and 4) transform (fundamen-tally changing government to make it truly citizen-centric). Building and maintaining trust in e-government require developing an understanding both of the many levels of interactions where trust must be earned and of cultural differences. Another challenge in developing such a framework is that e-government, itself, is very dynamic, changing rapidly over time. Trust in content or a system available one day may not carry over when the content and/or system changes dramatically. Components of a framework must include the follow-ing dimensions: conceptual domains, cultural dimensions, information content dimensions, and system di-mensions. Of course, these dimensions must be considered within the context of rapidly changing govern-ments, ICT services, the digital divide, and other factors. This paper provides a very brief overview of some of the notions of trust and distrust, concentrating on those concerning trust as it relates to notions of power, trust in organizations, and trust in information and information systems as one part of a framework to ad-dress the question of trust in e-government. It also makes a few recommendations for how to build citizen-centric e-government to ensure information rights through a focus on human dignity, fundamental human rights, and earning trust.",The International Review of Information Ethics,2007,7,,168-174,"Carbo, Toni",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139273782,5,
pub.1000066419,10.4018/978-1-59140-815-4.ch202,Women in the Free/Libre Open Source Software Development,"Free/libre open source software (FLOSS) has become a prominent phenomenon in the ICT field and the wider public domain for the past years. However, according to a FLOSS survey on FLOSS developers in 2002, “women do not play a role in the [FLOSS] development; only 1.1% of the FLOSS sample is female.” (Ghosh, Glott, Krieger, & Robles, 2002). In the mainstream research on FLOSS communities, many researchers also overlook different processes of community-building and diverse experiences of members, and presume a stereotyped male-dominated “hacker community” (e.g., Levy, 1984; Raymond, 2001; Himanen, 2001; Thomas, 2002). Moreover, issues around gender inequality are often ignored and/or muted in the pile of FLOSS studies. Female programmers often are rejected ex/implicitly from the software labour market (Levesque & Wilson 2004). The requirements of female users are not respected and consulted either (European Commission, 2001). This feature is opposite to the FLOSS ideal world where users should be equally treated and embraced (op. cit.). While many researchers endeavour to understand the FLOSS development, few found a gender-biased situation problematic. In short, women are almost invisible in current FLOSS-related literature. Most policies targeting at advocating FLOSS are also gender blind. Thus, this essay highlights the need for increased action to address imbalances between women’s and men’s access to and participation in the FLOSS development in cultural (e.g., chauvinistic and/or gender-biased languages in discussions on mailing lists or in documentations), economic (e.g., unequal salary levels for women and men), political (e.g., male-dominated advocacy environment) and technical (e.g., unbalanced students gender in technical tutorials) spheres. On the other hand, it also emphasises the powerful potential of FLOSS as a vehicle for advancing gender equality in software expertise. FLOSS helps transport knowledge and experience of software engineering through distributing source code together with the binary code almost without any limit. Many FLOSS licences such as the General Public Licence (GPL) also facilitates the flow of information and knowledge. In other words, if appropriately harnessed, FLOSS stands to meaningfully contribute to and mutually reinforce the advancement of effective, more expedited solutions to bridging the gender digital divide. In the end, this article points out that while women in more advanced countries have a better chance of upgrading their ICT skills and knowledge through participating in the FLOSS development, the opportunity is less available for women in the developing world. It is worth noting that although the gender issues raised in this article are widespread, they should not be considered as universally indifferent. Regional specificities in gender agenda in software engineering should be addressed distinctly (UNDP/UNIFEM, 2004).",Encyclopedia of Gender and Information Technology,2006,,,1286-1291,"Trauth, Eileen M.; Lin, Yuwei",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1000066419,7,

While many of these surveys emphasize the importance of technological issues, such as Web sites, interoperable data standards, and security protections, considerably less attention has been focused on the legislative environment that either facilitates or hinders the development of e-government at the national level. Like all countries, the United States has long grappled with the problem of how to centrally coordinate a diverse and sometimes incongruous collection of departments and agencies to achieve improved efficiencies, while maintaining a level of flexibility that enables these entities to carry out their specialized responsibilities effectively. This challenge can be made harder by the integration of information technology into government, by reifying organizational boundaries in the form of so-called “stove pipes” and “islands of automation.” To combat these problems, national governments are attempting to use legislative means to harmonize a cacophony of independent initiatives, and establish benchmarks for oversight. On December 17, 2002, President George W. Bush signed the E-Government Act of 2002 (116 Stat. 2899; P.L. 107-347) into law. Although there are many existing laws regarding issues such as information technology (IT) management, privacy, and information security, the E-Government Act of 2002 is the first national law that specifically addresses e-government in the United States. Prior to the passage of the E-Government Act, the law frequently cited as the most comprehensive information technology-related law was the Clinger-Cohen Act, signed into law in 1996, just 5 years after the development of the World Wide Web (1991) and at a time when the potential uses of the Internet were just beginning to be recognized by the larger, general public. The Clinger-Cohen Act provisions focus primarily on a narrow range of issues, including the decentralization of IT management within the U.S. federal government, pilot testing of new IT procurement procedures, and the establishment of chief information officer (CIO) positions in the major departments and agencies. In contrast, the provisions of the E-Government Act, described in greater detail below, address a much more comprehensive range of issues, suggesting that the integration of IT into government operations has reached a critical turning point. Some of these provisions include information security, IT management and training, the digital divide, and the creation of an Office of Electronic Government to coordinate and oversee e-government initiatives government-wide, among other duties.",Encyclopedia of Digital Government,2007,,,476-481,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Malkia, Matti; Seifert, J.

Design/methodology/approach The study utilised a cross‐sectional survey approach because it was restricted to final year students in the 2003–2004 year graduating class. The study also employed a convenience sampling technique and was executed by means of questionnaire administration and personal interviews. The final year students were asked to fill the questionnaires before a business policy lecture. The basic research instrument used in this research was a structured questionnaire with both open and close ended questions. Apart from questionnaires, in‐depth interviews with the respondents were also conducted with the respondents because we felt that because we were dealing with a research that had to do with technology, there could be latent issues that could only be uncovered by open discussions. Data were analysed and presented by means of simple descriptive statistics.   Findings Developing countries, especially in sub‐Saharan Africa, are often rich in the resources of people and staffing, if not in material resources. The promotion of information literacy is essentially dependent on using people differently, that is to better effect, not on injecting more resourcing into under‐funded services (although this is also important in many regards). Authorities at teaching universities, including lecturers, and heads of departments, must, as a matter of urgency, adopt mechanisms for creating better information skills and internet usage awareness among the students. This should focus on what the internet is, the services available through the internet, and the basic skills required to use the internet. This policy is not limited by resourcing, it is simply a new way to better use the richest resource of developing nations, the people and their talents.   Research limitations/implications Owing to the exploratory nature of the research, the results cannot be generalised with certainty. The research however gives pointers to gaps in the internet use propensities of business students in Ghana's business school and an internet education policy has to be instituted immediately to properly prepare students for an increasingly online Ghanaian business environment.   Practical implications The University of Ghana Business School should move towards the setting up of instructional labs.

pub.1019149003,10.4018/978-1-59904-947-2.ch013,E-Government Act of 2002 in the United States,"The United States is frequently ranked among the most advanced e-government countries in the world (Accenture, 2004; United Nations, 2003; West, 2004). While many of these surveys emphasize the importance of technological issues, such as Web sites, interoperable data standards, and security protections, considerably less attention has been focused on the legislative environment that either facilitates or hinders the development of e-government at the national level. Like all countries, the United States has long grappled with the problem of how to centrally coordinate a diverse and sometimes incongruous collection of departments and agencies to achieve improved efficiencies, while maintaining a level of flexibility that enables these entities to carry out their specialized responsibilities effectively. This challenge can be made harder by the integration of information technology into government, by reifying organizational boundaries in the form of so-called “stove pipes” and “islands of automation.” To combat these problems, national governments are attempting to use legislative means to harmonize a cacophony of independent initiatives, and establish benchmarks for oversight. On December 17, 2002, President George W. Bush signed the E-Government Act of 2002 (116 Stat. 2899; P.L. 107-347) into law. Although there are many existing laws regarding issues such as information technology (IT) management, privacy, and information security, the E-Government Act of 2002 is the first national law that specifically addresses e-government in the United States. Prior to the passage of the E-Government Act, the law frequently cited as the most comprehensive information technology-related law was the Clinger-Cohen Act, signed into law in 1996, just 5 years after the development of the World Wide Web (1991) and at a time when the potential uses of the Internet were just beginning to be recognized by the larger, general public. The Clinger-Cohen Act provisions focus primarily on a narrow range of issues, including the decentralization of IT management within the U.S. federal government, pilot testing of new IT procurement procedures, and the establishment of chief information officer (CIO) positions in the major departments and agencies. In contrast, the provisions of the E-Government Act, described in greater detail below, address a much more comprehensive range of issues, suggesting that the integration of IT into government operations has reached a critical turning point. Some of these provisions include information security, IT management and training, the digital divide, and the creation of an Office of Electronic Government to coordinate and oversee e-government initiatives government-wide, among other duties.",Electronic Government,2008,,,154-161,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Seifert, Jeffrey W.; Relyea, Harold C.",University of Memphis,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019149003,0,

Findings of this survey would then be used to coin a national ICTs policy and the e‐strategy to provide a roadmap towards a knowledge society. In a quest to assess the country's e‐readiness the Harvard University Guide (HUG) was used. Development in this paper is referred to as a process of change, which sets in motion principles whose objective is to eradicate poverty, injustice and various forms of exploitation. The pursuit of development therefore becomes the central pillar for policies. This paper seeks to provide a critical analysis of Zimbabwe's e‐readiness survey report and also focuses on the bedrock upon which the survey was carried out. It seeks to perceive an imperative to the e‐readiness assessment as also hinged on the technological determinist perspective as propounded by Marshal McLuhan (1964). This theory will be compounded by the diffusion of innovations model as coined by Everett Rogers (1962). The model strongly emphasizes the adoption of new technologies as the panacea for social change and development. The argument posited by the e‐readiness survey report is that in order to bridge the digital gap, Zimbabwe needs to build infrastructure to allow ICTs to be accessible. However, the e‐readiness survey report does not show a connection between the spread of ICTs infrastructure on the one hand and the economic and social development on the other. There is need to consider non‐quantifiable variables, such as poverty and social justice. The other factor as suggested above is the need for Zimbabwe to address current political and economic problems, as this isolation would impact heavily on the need to be interconnected.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2006,28,1,1-16,"Mhlanga, Brilliant",University of KwaZulu-Natal,South Africa,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099634010,7,"[Maddison, Simmon]|[]|Electronics Education|2002|2002|2|13-16|10.1049/ee.2002.0020|pub.1056749644|20;[Mudhai, Okoth Fred]|[ur.015566273615.55]|Ecquid Novi African Journalism Studies|2004|25|2|313-335|10.1080/02560054.2004.9653300|pub.1084541643|14;[Melkote, Srinivas; Steeves, H.]|[ur.014552667562.19; ur.016575264771.18]||2001||||10.4135/9788132113751|pub.1099297880|193;[]|[]|America Calling|1992||||10.1525/9780520915008|pub.1135926927|387"
pub.1003018299,10.4018/978-1-59140-562-7.ch102,Using Mobile Communication Technology in Student Mentoring,"Information technology (IT), computer science, and other related disciplines have become significant both in society and within the field of education. Resulting from the last decades’ considerable developments towards a global information society, the demand for a qualified IT workforce has increased. The integration of information technology into the different sectors of every day life is increasing the need for large numbers of IT professionals. Additionally, the need for nearly all workers to have general computing skills suggests possibilities for an individual to face inequality or suffer from displacement in modern society if they lack these skills, further contributing to the digital divide. Thus, the importance of IT education has a greater importance than ever for the whole of society. Despite the advances and mass adoption of new technologies, IT and computing education continually suffers from low participant numbers, and high dropout and transfer rates. This problem has been somewhat addressed by introducing mentoring programs (von Hellens, Nielsen, Doyle, & Greenhill, 1999) where a student is given a support person, a mentor, who has a similar education background but has graduated and is employed in industry. Although the majority of these programs have been considered successful, it is important to note that it is difficult to easily measure success in this context. In this article, we introduce a novel approach to mentoring which was adopted as part of an ongoing, traditional-type mentoring program in a large Australian university. The approach involved introducing modern communications technology, specifically mobile phones having an integrated camera and the capability to make use of multimedia messaging services (MMS). As mobile phones have become an integrated part of our everyday life (with high adoption rates) and are an especially common media of communication among young people, it was expected that the use of the phones could be easily employed to the mentoring program (phones were provided for the participants). Short message service (SMS), for example text messaging, has become a frequently used communication channel (Grinter & Eldridge 2003). In addition to text, photo sharing has also quickly taken off with MMS capable mobile phones becoming more widespread. The ability to exchange photos increases the feeling of presence (Counts & Fellheimer, 2004), and the possibility to send multimedia messages with mobile phones has created a new form of interactive storytelling (Kurvinen, 2003). Cole and Stanton (2003) found the pictorial information exchange as a potential tool for children’s collaboration during their activities in story telling, adventure gaming and for field trip tasks. Encouraged by these experiences, we introduced mobile mentoring as part of a traditional mentoring program, and present the experiences. It is hoped that these experiences can affirm the legitimacy of phone mentoring as a credible approach to mentoring. The positive and negative experiences presented in this article can help to shape the development of future phone mentoring programs.",Encyclopedia of Human Computer Interaction,2006,,,680-685,"Ghaoui, Claude; Häkkilä, Jonna; Beekhuyzen, Jenine",University of Oulu; Griffith University,Finland; Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1003018299,0,
pub.1047746058,10.4018/978-1-59140-789-8.ch150,Implementing E-Government Systems in Transition Economics,"In the last 20 years, the explosive development of telecommunication and computer technology has transformed information in the most important economic and social asset. The information society has changed the rules of interactions between people and organisations, increasing the power of individuals. The specific characteristics of the Internet permit freedom of expression and interaction, to a level unmatched by the traditional channel of communications. As the use of the Internet became more spread in the society, the governments understood that it is risky and ineffective to ignore the possibilities provided by online information and communication. Since the Internet cannot be controlled by any single institution, the only possibility to influence public opinion is to participate in online exchanges. From this perspective, the Internet can be defined as a highly democratic media channel, which allows not only one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many communication, but also the storage and retrieval of historical data. On the other hand, Internet communication can improve the efficiency of various administrative operations and reduce costs. E-government tends to be multidimensional, impacting above all on economic, social and governance dimensions. The benefits of introducing online system in the area of government and public administration are many and varied, such as: cost-effective delivery of services, improved revenue collection on taxes and service levies; IT literacy and reduction of the internal digital divide; increased access to and quality of education; improved education management capacity; improved social security; improved social welfare; integration and coordination of social and economic policy; improved public safety and security; increased capacity for a rational distribution of public funds (geographically and among population groups); greater accountability and transparency in public administration; better coordination and cooperation among government agencies and among different levels of government; improved public relations and communications; increased awareness of rights of civil society and obligations of government; greater public participation in governments’ affairs (United Nations, 2003). The implementation and effective co-ordination of e-government systems is complex and difficult, requiring knowledge and substantial resources. The implementation process will be most probably influenced by the level of economic development of every country, as well as by the political agenda of the ruling party. From this perspective, there might be significant differences between the developed economies that have a stable democratic system, and the developing countries, or the economies in transition. These countries, some of them with a fairly developed financial and technological infrastructure, experience specific conditions in terms of knowledge, technological abilities, IT market, telecommunication infrastructure, and regulations. Many of these countries are presently attempting to transform a traditional economy, into an e-society in which Internet communication and interaction pays a central role.",Encyclopedia of Digital Government,2007,,,1000-1005,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Malkia, Matti; Gurau, C.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047746058,1,

pub.1039296054,10.1145/1168987.1168988,Technology and older adults:: designing for accessibility and usability,"Two major demographic trends underscore the importance of considering technology adoption by older adults: the aging of the population and rapid dissemination of technology within most societal contexts. In the past decade, developments in computer and information technologies have occurred at an unprecedented rate and technology has become an integral component of work, education, healthcare, communication and entertainment. At the same time that we are witnessing explosive developments in technology the population is aging. In 2003 people aged 65+ yrs. in the United States numbered about 35 million and represented approximately 13% of the population. By 2030 this number is expected to increase to about 71 million representing 20% of the population). Moreover, there will be a dramatic increase in those aged 85+ yrs. increasing in numbers from about 4 million in 2000 to nearly 21 million by 2050. Recent data for the U.S. also indicate that although the use of technology such as computers and the Internet among older adults is increasing there is still an age-based digital divide.Not having access to and being able to use technology may put older adults at a disadvantage in terms of their ability to live independently. For example, the Internet is rapidly becoming a major vehicle for communication and information dissemination about health, community and government services. Technology also offers the potential for enhancing the quality of life of older people by augmenting their ability to perform a variety of tasks and access information. To make technology useful to and usable by older adults a challenge for the research and design community is to ""know thy user"" and better understand the needs, preferences and abilities of older people. It is fairly well established that many technology products and systems are not easily accessible to older people. There are of course a myriad of reasons for this such as cost, lack of access to training programs, etc. However, to a large part it is because designers are unaware of the needs of users with varying abilities or do not know how to accommodate their needs in the design process.Although, older adults today are healthier, more diverse and better educated than previous generations, there are age-related changes in functional abilities that have relevance to the design of technology systems. These include changes in sensory/perceptual processes, motor abilities, response speed, and cognitive processes. The likelihood of developing a disability increases with age, and many older people have at least one chronic condition such as arthritis or hearing and vision impairments. This presentation will discuss the implications of age-related changes in abilities that have relevance to system design and provide a summary of what is currently know about the adoption and use of technology by older people. Recommendations to accommodate these age-related changes in abilities will also be discussed. In addition, a brief discussion of strategies to include the needs of older people in the design process will be presented. It is hoped that this presentation will highlight some important issues and in doing so help bridge the existing age-related digital divide.",Proceedings of the 8th international ACM SIGACCESS conference on Computers and accessibility  - Assets '06,2006,,,1-1,"Czaja, Sara J.",University of Miami,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039296054,8,

By so doing, readers faced with similar teaching challenges might be better prepared to respond to the many challenges, both in the context of the preparations they will be required to make as well as in the context of their actual content delivery at their workshops.",The International Information & Library Review,2010,42,2,111-123,"Fahmy, Engy I.; Rifaat, Nermine M.",American University in Cairo,Egypt,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1003773729,4,"[Gross, Melissa; Latham, Don]|[ur.010145152227.20; ur.010462754167.96]|Library & Information Science Research|2007|29|3|332-353|10.1016/j.lisr.2007.04.012|pub.1008186819|136;[Amsberry, Dawn]|[ur.010504327551.20]|The Journal of Academic Librarianship|2008|34|4|354-357|10.1016/j.acalib.2008.05.007|pub.1012293376|25;[Jackson, Pamela A.]|[]|Reference Services Review|2005|33|2|197-209|10.1108/00907320510597408|pub.1014754364|63;[Kraemer, Elizabeth W.; Lombardo, Shawn V.; Lepkowski, Frank J.]|[ur.016572432446.12; ur.014300260353.55; ]|College & Research Libraries|2007|68|4|330-342|10.5860/crl.68.4.330|pub.1016708670|39;[Pinto, María; Sales, Dora]|[ur.011215107767.10; ur.012571202705.21]|Journal of Information Science|2007|33|5|531-550|10.1177/0165551506076404|pub.1021496459|23;[Hmeidi, Ismail; Kanaan, Ghassan; Evens, Martha]|[ur.010674542421.54; ur.015002404240.95; ur.01360412560.70]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|1997|48|10|867-881|10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(199710)48:10<867::aid-asi3>3.0.co;2-#|pub.1023715192|31;[Hegazi, Nadia; Ali, Nabil; Abed, Ehsan]|[ur.016232214623.23; ; ur.014041673223.89]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|1987|38|2|133-137|10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(198703)38:2<133::aid-asi8>3.0.co;2-p|pub.1031623391|5;[Boekhorst, Albert K.; Horton, Forest Woody]|[ur.014010235775.47; ur.07656374431.17]|The International Information & Library Review|2009|41|4|224-230|10.1080/10572317.2009.10762818|pub.1032139132|2;[Dutta, Renee]|[]|The International Information & Library Review|2009|41|1|44-51|10.1080/10572317.2009.10762796|pub.1037958119|62;[Gremmels, Gillian S.; Lehmann, Karen Shostrom]|[ur.010550520675.48; ]|College & Research Libraries|2007|68|6|488-502|10.5860/crl.68.6.488|pub.1039286984|11;[Pinto, Maria; Doucet, A.-Vinciane]|[ur.011215107767.10; ur.016311374001.16]|The Journal of Academic Librarianship|2007|33|5|604-611|10.1016/j.acalib.2007.05.005|pub.1043599356|10;[Avery, Susan]|[]|The Reference Librarian|2008|49|2|109-118|10.1080/02763870802101260|pub.1044161159|8;[Moukdad, Haidar; Large, Andrew]|[ur.015562656665.30; ur.011042355725.38]|Libri|2001|51|2|63-74|10.1515/libr.2001.63|pub.1049826139|18;[Al‐Qallaf, Charlene L.; Mika, Joseph J.]|[ur.011731315413.45; ur.015404633473.88]|Public Library Quarterly|2009|28|2|127-161|10.1080/01616840902892390|pub.1052751865|3"
pub.1095275906,10.1109/lisat.2011.5784226,Service-Learning Computing Courses Assist with Technology Needs in Community Based Organizations Serving Older Adults,"The rapidly exploding aged 60 and over population is expected to comprise 22% of the general population by 2020 and is the same age group which has the greatest digital divide. The senior citizen population in New York is notably higher than the national average. The high tech world that surrounds the older adult population relies on smartphones to servers and being connected to the Internet. The elderly have nothing to relate technology to in their past learning experiences, thus find it difficult to incorporate computing skills into long-term memory. Many senior citizens know they have to learn how to operate a computer because the world will leave them behind. The Internet proves essential to the elderly in not only connecting with family, friends, and lost acquaintances, thus avoiding social isolation, but provides valuable health related information and healthcare options. Moreover, research has shown frequent Internet use by older adults stimulates cognition. Other studies have shown technology enriches daily functions and improves the overall life quality of older adults. Older adults are often not comfortable with the swiftly advancing technology. Many older adults feel computers are intimidating and fear breaking the machine, thus reluctant to learn how to use them. Furthermore, many residents in skilled nursing facilities have hearing, visual, and motor skill impairments making computer utilization an immense challenge. Thus, this aged population that has so much to gain from using a computer for email, web surfing, online shopping, and connecting to the world around them are often unwilling or unable to operate a computer. The core of the research project discussed in this paper is a unique course entitled, Intergenerational Computing. Intergenerational Computing is an undergraduate service-learning course offered within the school of computer science for non-majors in collaboration with nursing faculty. Students enrolled in the course provide technology instruction to older adults as part of their service-learning experience. Older adults receive individualized tutoring in a non-threatening learning environment. Student-teachers assist to overcome the computer fears of the elderly while the elderly learn a new set of communication skills, while being mentally challenged. Other computing courses, including Computer Systems and Hardware, as well as Networking Technologies, contain service-learning term projects in the curriculum. Students select to build computer labs, install networks, and distribute refurbished computer equipment to disadvantaged senior citizens. Some students additionally chose to modify traditional mice and develop prototypes of Nintendo Wii™ remotes to be more accessible to older adults. Other students have installed software and hardware in computer labs, as well as virtually designed housing for a livable community project via Second Life –– all specifically for the benefit of senior citizens. This paper presents a research project including objectives, description, assessments, lessons learned, and suggestions for successful replication. Tips for low or no budget training, as well as guidance for integrating service-learning projects into the IT course syllabus will be discussed.","2011 IEEE Long Island Systems, Applications and Technology Conference",2011,,,1-6,"Wexler, Sharon Stahl; Drury, Lin J.; Coppola, Jean F.; Tschinkel, Brian J.; Thomas, Barbara A.",Pace University; Westchester Community College,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095275906,3,"[Brooks, Christopher H.]|[ur.015354662567.22]|ACM SIGCSE Bulletin|2008|40|1|352-356|10.1145/1352135.1352256|pub.1003792481|15;[Kiel, Joan M]|[ur.01270137467.99]|Informatics for Health and Social Care|2005|30|1|19-23|10.1080/14639230500066900|pub.1004423046|88;[Seals, Cheryl D.; Clanton, Kelley; Agarwal, Ravikant; Doswell, Felicia; Thomas, Chippewa M.]|[ur.01177233420.58; ur.013637521105.68; ur.016335562222.52; ur.014031670473.62; ur.014203606526.82]|Educational Gerontology|2008|34|12|1055-1069|10.1080/03601270802290185|pub.1008726261|31;[Cresci, M Kay; Jarosz, Patricia A]|[ur.01012350243.13; ur.0707517043.15]|Geriatric Nursing|2010|31|6|455-463|10.1016/j.gerinurse.2010.10.006|pub.1019327388|17;[Goldweber, Mikey; Davoli, Renzo; Little, Joyce Currie; Riedesel, Charles; Walker, Henry; Cross, Gerry; Von Konsky, Brian R.]|[ur.014617032273.21; ur.014550557265.52; ur.07533257653.36; ur.016640760503.03; ur.016434316455.82; ur.015774202125.20; ur.015357517025.79]|ACM Inroads|2011|2|1|64-82|10.1145/1929887.1929907|pub.1022669328|31;[Kenworthy-U’Ren, Amy L.]|[ur.010004656133.76]|Journal of Business Ethics|2007|81|4|811-822|10.1007/s10551-007-9549-3|pub.1028098761|53;[Cresci, M.

pub.1046286284,10.4018/978-1-59140-789-8.ch233,The Telehealth Divide,"In the United States, the public is accessing the Internet to provide information and deliver services, and to interact with citizens, business, and other government agencies (Bimber, 1999; Pardo, 2000; West, 2003, 2004). As with any change between citizen-government interactions, e-government is accompanied by speculation on its impact to both citizen and government. E-government capability of continual service delivery can make government efficient and transparent to the public (Norris, 1999; West, 2003), and more responsive to public needs through fast and convenient communication options (Thomas & Streib, 2003). It permits quicker material update than traditional distribution methods (Pardo, 2000). However, other literature suggests e-government will not live up to these prospects. A separation exists among citizens that use and do not use the Internet. This separation is based on a number of factors, including inequalities in Internet access “digital divide” and technological skills, along with psychological and cultural barriers. Literature extensively shows the differences in United States Internet use to fall along important socioeconomic and demographic factors, such as age, race, education, and income (Mossberger, Tolbert, & Stansbury, 2003; Neu, Anderson, & Bikson, 1999; Pew Internet & American Life Project, 2003c; U.S. Department of Commerce, 2002; Wilheim, 2000). E-government may create inequalities in the delivery of government information and services. Telehealth is a specific form of e-government aimed at improving the accessibility and quality of healthcare, and reducing service costs (Schmeida, 2004a). It relies on electronic information and telecommunication technology innovation (H.R. 2157, 2001). As nations contend with expensive healthcare, the promise of better healthcare service delivery at a reduced cost has made teleheath an increasingly attractive policy option in the United States and internationally. Telehealth advancement greatly reflects the dramatic changes in the telecommunication industry. In the 1990s, we witnessed considerable advancement, such as the use of digital technology—interactive video and Internet. Interactive video, for example, can link doctors and medical students afar improving medical education. Rural citizens can interact with specialist(s) through interactive video rather than traveling great distances for a medical consultation. The Internet can bring health related information into the home for better healthcare decision-making. Telehealth can be conceptualized as both an administrative reform policy and regulatory policy. As a hybrid policy type, it mostly exhibits the characteristics of administrative reform, such as e-government (McNeal, Tolbert, Mossberger, & Dotterweich, 2003; Schmeida, McNeal, & Mossberger, 2004) driven by the goals of cost reduction and increasing efficiency, paramount to telehealth adoption and implementation. Administrative reform policy does not involve the direct and coercive use of government power over citizens and are therefore associated with low levels of conflict (Ripley & Franklin, 1980). Regulatory policy, on the other hand tends to be politically salient among citizens as well as controversial among the actors within the policy community. Traditionally, those interests who are regulated have been important players in the policy process. Important telehealth players are physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and health insurers. Since telehealth straddles both administrative and reform policy areas, it is difficult to predict the actors that will play the greatest role in assisting or impeding its implementation. Execution of regulatory policy is highly volatile and controversial with shifting of alliances and players. However, administrative policy innovations are low salience, and as some regulatory policies it involves technical issues, often driven by professional networks and elected officials.",Encyclopedia of Digital Government,2007,,,1524-1528,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Malkia, Matti; Schmeida, M.; McNeal, R.",Cleveland Clinic; University of Illinois at Springfield,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046286284,0,
pub.1039499574,10.4018/978-1-59140-815-4.ch024,The Cross-Cultural Dimension of Gender and Information Technology,"The underrepresentation of women in the information technology (IT) sector has been widely studied in the contexts of western countries such as North American and Western European countries. These studies indicate that the underrepresentation of women in the IT sector is unveiled in multiple perspectives, including IT access, the development, adoption and use of IT, IT education, and the IT workforce in general and within the IT workforce structure itself (e.g., different levels of IT positions) (Cooper & Weaver, 2003; Gürer & Camp, 2002; Hartzel, 2003; Klein, Jiang & Tesch, 2002; Margolis & Fisher, 2002; Rommes, 2002; Trauth, 2002; von Hellens, Neilsen, & Beekhuyzen, 2001; Webster, 1996). Why is it important to study issues related to gender and information technology? First, it is argued that the information technology sector should value and leverage all kinds of diversity (including gender diversity as one dimension) to enhance productivity, to facilitate IT innovation, and to develop IT for a wide variety of people (Avgerou, 2002; Roberts, 2003; Trauth, Huang, Morgan, Quesenberry, & Yeo, 2006). Second, it is also argued that women’s underrepresentation in and exclusion from information technology can be attributed to power and socio-cultural reproduction of inequality through technology development and use, and the historically social-construction of technology fields as “masculine” domains, which result in a gendered digital divide (Cockburn, 1985; Kvasny & Trauth, 2002; Kvasny & Truex, 2001; Wajcman, 1991, 2004; Woodfield, 2000). Ignorance or failure to address issues related to gender and IT will further marginalize women’s participation in future economic and social development, and will endanger social equality and social welfare in general (Kvasny & Trauth, 2002). A significant trend of the contemporary information technology industry is towards globalization, which is manifested through a variety of established practices such as IT offshore outsourcing, global software development, and innovation through global R&D (research & design) collaboration (Sahay, Nicholson, & Krishna, 2003; Walsham, 2000, 2001, 2002). Such a globalization trend of the IT industry and market has put forward new challenges to gender and IT research, to incorporate the cross-cultural dimension. Similar to the rationale for studying gender and IT in developed countries (leveraging diversity and improving social inclusion), Hafkin and Taggart (2001) argued that it is imperative to examine the cultural factors while studying gender and IT in developing countries. Although the research on the cross-cultural dimension of gender relations with information technology is limited, Galpin (2002) pointed out that the underrepresentation of women in IT seems to be a worldwide phenomenon indicated by statistics. Galpin (2002) also pointed out that there is a wide range of participation in IT by women, which is influenced by complex cultural and societal factors that are different from country to country. Models related to gender relations to IT developed in certain socio-cultural contexts may not be applicable to others (Clarke & Teague, 1994a; El Louadi & Everard, 2005; Mukhopadhyay, 1996, 2004). In addition to the importance of studying gender and IT within a specific cultural context, there is another perspective of the cross-cultural dimension of gender and IT: the increasingly diversified global IT workforce as a result of the IT skill shortage, global IT outsourcing, and other global IT collaborations. For example, under the pressure of the skill shortage of the IT workforce in America, the IT institutions and industry turn to the global intellectual pool for recruiting talented international students and skilled IT workers through F-1 and H1-B visas (National Research Council, 2001). According to the 2005 ITAA (Information Technology Association of America) report, the representation of Asian IT workers in the IT workforce doubled the number of Asian worker in the overall workforce in America (ITAA, 2005). Globally, an increasing number of countries have a maturing IT sector, which enables them to enter the global IT outsourcing market or to engage in globally distributed collaborative software work through virtual environment (Trauth et al., 2005). The mobility and cultural diversity of the global IT workforce will add more complexity to articulate their gender relations to IT since individuals may have different cultural backgrounds and experiences. Therefore, it is important for scholars and practitioners to explore the cross-cultural dimension of gender and IT to understand how the nuances of different cultural influences shape women’s relations with IT, to build knowledge with respect to the plural perspective of gender and IT research, and to prepare future global IT workforce. In this article, I first articulate the theoretical underpinnings of cross-cultural dimension of gender and IT research, then review some current studies related to this research area, and finally discuss some future research agendas.",Encyclopedia of Gender and Information Technology,2006,,,147-153,"Trauth, Eileen M.; Huang, Haiyan",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039499574,0,

pub.1068641750,10.18438/b8sp7f,Canadian Public Library Users are Unaware of Their Information Literacy Deficiencies as Related to Internet Use and Public Libraries are Challenged to Address These Needs,"A Review of: Julien, Heidi and Cameron Hoffman. “Information Literacy Training in Canada’s Public Libraries.” Library Quarterly 78.1 (2008): 19-41. Objective – To examine the role of Canada’s public libraries in information literacy skills training, and to ascertain the perspectives of public library Internet users with regard to their experiences of information literacy. Design – Qualitative research using semi-structured interviews and observations. Setting – Five public libraries in Canada. Subjects – Twenty-eight public library staff members and twenty-five customers. Methods – This study constituted the second phase of a detailed examination of information literacy (IL) training in Canadian public libraries. Five public libraries located throughout Canada were selected for participation. These comprised a large central branch of a public library located in a town with a population of approximately two million, a main branch of a public library in an urban city of about one million people, a public library in a town with a population of about 75,000, a library in a town of 900 people and a public library located in the community center of a Canadian First Nations reserve that housed a population of less than 100 persons. After notifying customers via signage posted in the vicinity of computers and Internet access areas, the researchers observed each patron as they accessed the Internet via library computers. Observations focused on the general physical environment of the Internet access stations, customer activities and use of the Internet, as well as the nature and degree of customer interactions with each other and with staff. Photographs were also taken and observations were recorded via field notes. The former were analyzed via qualitative content analysis while quantitative analysis was applied to the observations. Additionally, each observed participant was interviewed immediately following Internet use. Interview questions focused on a range of issues including the reasons why customers used the Internet in public libraries, customers’ perceptions about their level of information literacy and their feelings with regard to being information literate, the nature of their exposure to IL training, the benefits they derived from such training, and their desire for further training. Public service librarians and other staff were also interviewed in a similar manner. These questions sought to ascertain staff views on the role of the public library with regard to IL training; perceptions of the need for and expected outcomes of such training; as well as the current situation pertinent to the provision of IL skills training in their respective libraries in terms of staff competencies, resource allocation, and the forms of training and evaluation. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Data were interpreted via qualitative content analysis through the use of NVivo software. Main Results – Men were more frequent users of public library computers than women, outnumbering them by a ratio ranging from 2:1 to 3.4:1. Customers appeared to be mostly under the age of 30 and of diverse ethnicities. The average income of interviewed customers was less than the Canadian average. The site observations revealed that customers were seen using the Internet mainly for the purposes of communication (e.g., e-mail, instant messaging, online dating services). Such use was observed 78 times in four of the libraries. Entertainment accounted for 43 observations in all five sites and comprised activities such as online games, music videos, and movie listings. Twenty-eight observations involved business/financial uses (e.g., online shopping, exploration of investment sites, online banking). The use of search engines (25 observations), news information (23), foreign language and forum websites (21), and word processing were less frequently observed. Notably, there were only 20 observed library-specific uses (e.g., searching online catalogues, online database and library websites). Customers reported that they used the Internet mainly for general web searching and for e-mail. It was also observed that in general the physical environment was not conducive to computer use due to uncomfortable or absent seating and a lack of privacy. Additionally, only two sites had areas specifically designated for IL instruction. Of the 25 respondents, 19 reported at least five years experience with the Internet, 9 of whom cited experience of 10 years or more. Self-reported confidence with the Internet was high: 16 individuals claimed to be very confident, 7 somewhat confident, and only 2 lacking in confidence. There was a weak positive correlation between years of use and individuals’ reported levels of confidence. Customers reported interest in improving computer literacy (e.g., keyboarding ability) and IL skills (ability to use more sources of information). Some expressed a desire “to improve certain personal attitudes” (30), such as patience when conducting Internet searches. When presented with the Association of College and Research Libraries’ definition of IL, 13 (52%) of those interviewed claimed to be information literate, 8 were ambivalent, and 4 admitted to being information illiterate. Those who professed to be information literate had no particular feeling about this state of being, however 10 interviewees admitted feeling positive about being able to use the Internet to retrieve information. Most of those interviewed (15) disagreed that a paucity of IL skills is a deterrent to “accessing online information efficiently and effectively” (30). Eleven reported development of information skills through self teaching, while 8 cited secondary schools or tertiary educational institutions. However, such training was more in terms of computer technology education than IL. Eleven of the participants expressed a desire for additional IL training, 5 of whom indicated a preference for the public library to supply such training. Customers identified face-to-face, rather than online, as the ideal training format. Four interviewees identified time as the main barrier to Internet use and online access. As regards library staff, 22 (78.6%) of those interviewed posited IL training as an important role for public libraries. Many stated that customers had been asking for formal IL sessions with interest in training related to use of the catalogue, databases, and productivity software, as well as searching the web. Two roles were identified in the context of the public librarian as a provider of IL: “library staff as teachers/agents of empowerment and library staff as ‘public parents’” (32). The former was defined as supporting independent, lifelong learning through the provision of IL skills, and the latter encompassing assistance, guidance, problem solving, and filtering of unsuitable content. Staff identified challenges to IL training as societal challenges (e.g., need for customers to be able to evaluate information provided by the media, the public library’s role in reducing the digital divide), institutional (e.g., marketing of IL programs, staff constraints, lack of budget for IL training), infrastructural (e.g., limited space, poor Internet access in library buildings) and pedagogical challenges, such as differing views pertinent to the philosophy of IL, as well as the low levels of IL training to which Canadian students at all levels had been previously exposed. Despite these challenges library staff acknowledged positive outcomes resulting from IL training in terms of customers achieving a higher level of computer literacy, becoming more skillful at searching, and being able to use a variety of information sources. Affective benefits were also apparent such as increased independence and willingness to learn. Library staff also identified life expanding outcomes, such as the use of IL skills to procure employment. In contrast to customer self-perception, library staff expressed that customers’ IL skills were low, and that this resulted in their avoidance of “higher-level online research” and the inability to “determine appropriate information sources” (36). Several librarians highlighted customers’ incapacity to perform simple activities such as opening an email account. Library staff also alluded to customer’s reluctance to ask them for help. Libraries in the study offered a wide range of training. All provided informal, personalized training as needed. Formal IL sessions on searching the catalogue, online searching, and basic computer skills were conducted by the three bigger libraries. A mix of librarians and paraprofessional staff provided the training in these libraries. However, due to a lack of professional staff, the two smaller libraries offered periodic workshops facilitated by regional librarians. All the libraries lacked a defined training budget. Nonetheless, the largest urban library was well-positioned to offer IL training as it had a training coordinator, a training of trainers program, as well as technologically-equipped training spaces. The other libraries in this study provided no training of trainers programs and varied in terms of the adequacy of spaces allocated for the purpose of training. The libraries also varied in terms of the importance placed on the evaluation of IL training. At the largest library evaluation forms were used to improve training initiatives, while at the small town library “evaluations were done anecdotally” (38). Conclusion – While Internet access is available and utilized by a wide cross section of the population, IL skills are being developed informally and not through formal training offered by public libraries. Canadian public libraries need to work to improve information literacy skills by offering and promoting formal IL training programs.",Evidence Based Library and Information Practice,2009,4,4,58-62,"Preddie, Martha Ingrid",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1068641750,2,

The emergence of personalized homepage services, e.g. personalized Google Homepage and Microsoft Windows Live, has enabled Web users to select Web contents of interest and to aggregate them in a single Web page. The web contents are often predefined content blocks provided by the service providers. However, it involves intensive manual efforts to define the content blocks and maintain the information in it. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized homepage system, called .Homepage Live., to allow end users to use drag-and-drop actions to collect their favorite Web content blocks from existing Web pages and organize them in a single page. Moreover, Homepage Live automatically traces the changes of blocks with the evolvement of the container pages by measuring the tree edit distance of the selected blocks. By exploiting the immutable elements of Web pages, the tracing algorithm performance is significantly improved. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm. expand Open user profiles for adaptive news systems: help or harm?

Over the last five years, a range of projects have focused on progressively more elaborated techniques for adaptive news delivery. However, the adaptation process in these systems has become more complicated and thus less transparent to the users. In this paper, we concentrate on the application of open user models in adding transparency and controllability to adaptive news systems. We present a personalized news system, YourNews, which allows users to view and edit their interest profiles, and report a user study on the system. Our results confirm that users prefer transparency and control in their systems, and generate more trust to such systems. However, similar to previous studies, our study demonstrate that this ability to edit user profiles may also harm the system.s performance and has to be used with caution. expand Investigating behavioral variability in web search Ryen W.

Understanding the extent to which people's search behaviors differ in terms of the interaction flow and information targeted is important in designing interfaces to help World Wide Web users search more effectively. In this paper we describe a longitudinal log-based study that investigated variability in people.s interaction behavior when engaged in search-related activities on the Web.allWe analyze the search interactions of more than two thousand volunteer users over a five-month period, with the aim of characterizing differences in their interaction styles.allThe findings of our study suggest that there are dramatic differences in variability in key aspects of the interaction within and between users, and within and between the search queries they submit.allOur findings also suggest two classes of extreme user. navigators and explorers. whose search interaction is highly consistent or highly variable. Lessons learned from these users can inform the design of tools to support effective Web-search interactions for everyone. expand SESSION: Smarter browsing Csurf: a context-driven non-visual web-browser Jalal U.

Web sites are designed for graphical mode of interaction. Sighted users can ""cut to the chase"" and quickly identify relevant information in Web pages. On the contrary, individuals with visual disabilities have to use screen-readers tobrowse the Web. As screen-readers process pages sequentially and read through everything, Web browsing can become strenuous and time-consuming. Although, the use ofshortcuts and searching offers some improvements, the problem still remains. In this paper, we address the problemof information overload in non-visual Web access using thenotion of context. Our prototype system, CSurf, embodyingour approach, provides the usual features of a screen-reader.However, when a user follows a link, CSurf captures thecontext of the link using a simple topic-boundary detectiontechnique, and uses it to identify relevant information on...",Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web  - WWW '07,2007,,,71-80,"Gatterbauer, Wolfgang; Bohunsky, Paul; Herzog, Marcus; Krüpl, Bernhard; Pollak, Bernhard",TU Wien,Austria,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005629363,152,"[Krüpl, Bernhard; Herzog, Marcus; Gatterbauer, Wolfgang]|[ur.07701412261.53; ur.014436411373.67; ur.01364730334.55]|Special interest tracks and posters of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web  - WWW '05|2005|||1000-1001|10.1145/1062745.1062838|pub.1009571556|32;[Yang, Yingchen; Luk, Wo-Shun]|[; ur.0726650606.68]|Proceedings of the fourth international workshop on Web information and data management  - WIDM '02|2002|||36-42|10.1145/584931.584940|pub.1013173579|29;[Culotta, Aron; McCallum, Andrew; Betz, Jonathan]|[ur.016024514341.70; ur.01001546740.39; ur.014722000133.32]|Proceedings of the main conference on Human Language Technology Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association of Computational Linguistics  -|2006|||296-303|10.3115/1220835.1220873|pub.1014531239|107;[Simon, Kai; Lausen, Georg]|[ur.015337170151.32; ur.07726727015.55]|Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management  - CIKM '05|2005|||381-388|10.1145/1099554.1099672|pub.1015486151|131;[Zhai, Yanhong; Liu, Bing]|[ur.015441534327.25; ur.016133206343.26]|Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web  - WWW '05|2005|||76-85|10.1145/1060745.1060761|pub.1017514996|312;[Aumann, Yonatan; Feldman, Ronen; Liberzon, Yair; Rosenfeld, Benjamin; Schler, Jonathan]|[ur.015202435666.27; ur.015256772047.01; ur.012454166207.11; ur.016522452753.07; ur.013751300161.42]|Knowledge and Information Systems|2006|10|1|1-15|10.1007/s10115-006-0014-x|pub.1019624294|19;[Lerman, Kristina; Getoor, Lise; Minton, Steven; Knoblock, Craig]|[ur.0655606300.19; ur.010710276421.60; ur.01274716314.87; ur.01134133120.09]|Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data  - SIGMOD '04|2004|||119-130|10.1145/1007568.1007584|pub.1020248508|84;[Embley, David W.; Lopresti, Daniel; Nagy, George]|[ur.010007522541.11; ur.012733477231.90; ur.013711502063.77]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2006|3872||164-175|10.1007/11669487_15|pub.1020342722|26;[Pivk, A.; Cimiano, P.; Sure, Y.]|[ur.013000233027.70; ur.015546222053.43; ur.015165341155.18]|Journal of Web Semantics|2005|3|2-3|132-146|10.1016/j.websem.2005.06.003|pub.1020843849|12;[Wang, Yalin; Hu, Jianying]|[ur.010726510417.13; ur.01103646175.49]|Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on World Wide Web  - WWW '02|2002|||242-250|10.1145/511446.511478|pub.1021626234|121;[Parsia, Bijan; Patel-Schneider, Peter F.]|[ur.011355175742.58; ur.016676426740.37]|Proceedings of the 13th international World Wide Web conference on Alternate track papers & posters  - WWW Alt.
