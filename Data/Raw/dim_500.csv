2568,pub.1078044770,,20127629,,[Promoting nursing competitiveness: introduction to the digital divide].,"Increasingly sophisticated information technology (IT) has widened the gap (the so-called ""digital divide"") between those with effective access to IT resources and those without. Problems related to the digital divide exist in every country. In addition to level of familiarity with technology, the divide can also be influenced by factors of race, gender, age, education, economic status and area of residence. The digital divide may be ameliorated through technology innovations in terms of access to information, information application and information literacy. As IT is an increasingly significant component of modern healthcare, it may be expected that the ""width"" of the potential gap widens as IT applications increase in sophistication. Nursing professionals must keep abreast of advancing technologies in order to narrow the digital divide. To cope with this challenge, nursing professionals should enhance their understanding of new technologies beyond what is taught in formal education curricula. This knowledge enhancement may be attained through self learning or on-the-job training in nursing informatics. Content could cover hospital information system (IS) usage, security, applications and web access. This will improve the ability of nursing staff to face the current IT challenge.",,Journal of Nursing,,Humans; Nursing Informatics,2010-02,2010,,2010-02,57,1,95-9,Closed,Article,"Lin, Chun-Hsu; Lee, Ting-Ting","Lin, Chun-Hsu (Department of Nursing, National Taipei College of Nursing, ROC.); Lee, Ting-Ting ()",,"Lin, Chun-Hsu (); Lee, Ting-Ting ()",2,0,0.1,1.29,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1078044770,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,4 Quality Education

Existing literature on Internet uses by adults indicates that low income, less educated, and minority individuals are less likely to be online health seekers. Based on the analysis of data from the Pew Internet and American Life Project for the US, this study finds that teens of low education parents are either as likely as or even more likely than teens of high education parents to seek online health information. Multiple regression analysis shows that the higher engagement in health seeking by teens of low education parents is related to a lower prevalence of parental Internet use, suggesting that some of these teens may be seeking online health information on behalf of their low education parents.

WinVicos is operated on a workstation (WoTeSa) using standard hardware components and offers a superior image quality at a moderate transmission bandwidth of up to 2 Mbps. WoTeSa / WinVicos have been applied for IP-based communication in different satellite-based telemedical networks. In the DELTASS-project a disaster scenario was analysed and an appropriate telecommunication system for effective rescue measures for the victims was set up and evaluated. In the MEDASHIP project an integrated system for telemedical services (teleconsultation, teleelectro-cardiography, telesonography) on board of cruise ships and ferries has been set up. EMISPHER offers an equal access for most of the countries of the Euro-Mediterranean area to on-line services for health care in the required quality of service. E-learning applications, real-time telemedicine and shared management of medical assistance have been realized. The innovative developments in ICT with the aim of realizing a ubiquitous access to medical resources for everyone at any time and anywhere (u-Health) bear the risk of creating and amplifying a digital divide in the world. Therefore we have analyzed how the objective needs of the heterogeneous partners can be joined with the result that there is a need for real integration of the various platforms and services. A virtual combination of applications serves as the basic idea for the Virtual Hospital. The development of virtual hospitals and digital medicine helps to bridge the digital divide between different regions of the world and enables equal access to high-level medical care. Pre-operative planning, intra-operative navigation and minimally-invasive surgery require a digital and virtual environment supporting the perception of the physician.

However, it is less clear whether the benefits of greater access to online health information and health information technologies is equitably distributed across population groups, particularly to those who are underserved. To examine this issue, this article employs the 2007 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) to investigate relationships between a variety of socio-economic variables and the use of the web-based technologies for health information seeking, personal health information management and patient-provider communication within the context of the USA. This study reveals interesting patterns in technology adoption, some of which are in line with previous studies, while others are less clear. Whether these patterns indicate early evidence of a narrowing divide in eHealth technology use across population groups as a result of the narrowing divide in Internet access and computer ownership warrants further exploration. In particular, the findings emphasize the need to explore differences in the use of eHealth tools by medically underserved and disadvantaged groups.

Although research has found that once Internet access is achieved, there are no ethnic differences in Internet health information seeking, it is unclear if there are ethnic differences in patient-provider communication about Internet health information. To help fill this gap in the literature, the National Cancer Institute's Health Information National Trends Survey 2005 was analyzed with Stata 9. Two sets of logistic regression analyses were conducted, one for a subsample of Internet users (n = 3,244) and one for a subsample of Internet users who are first-generation immigrants (n = 563). The dependent variable was patient-provider communication about Internet health information, which assessed whether survey participants had discussed online health information with a health care provider. The predictor variables included trust of health care provider, trust of online health information, Internet use, health care coverage, frequency of visits to health care provider, health status, and demographics.

This is especially true in medically underserved populations, which are often viewed as having limited access to health information.
OBJECTIVE: To improve communication between an urban health centre and the community it serves, a team of library and information science researchers undertook an assessment of patients' level and methods of access to and use of the Internet.
METHODS: Data were collected in 53 face-to-face anonymous interviews with patients at the centre. Interviews were tape-recorded for referential accuracy, and data were analysed to identify patterns of access and use.
RESULTS: Seventy-two percentage of study participants reported having access to the Internet through either computers or cell phones. Barriers to Internet access were predominantly lack of equipment or training rather than lack of interest. Only 21% of those with Internet access reported using the Internet to look for health information.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that lack of access to the Internet in itself is not the primary barrier to seeking health information in this population and that the digital divide exists not at the level of information access but rather at the level of information use.",,Health Information & Libraries Journal,,Access to Information; Adult; Attitude to Computers; Consumer Health Information; Female; Health Education; Humans; Information Services; Internet; Male; Medically Underserved Area; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient Education as Topic; Philadelphia; Poverty; Qualitative Research; Urban Population,2011-12-19,2011,2011-12-19,2012-03,29,1,61-71,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Zach, Lisl; Dalrymple, Prudence W.; Rogers, Michelle L.; Williver‐Farr, Heather","Zach, Lisl (College of Information Science & Technology, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA); Dalrymple, Prudence W.

A Geographic Analysis of Information Technology in Southern California Physician Offices,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether physician offices located in high-minority and low-income neighborhoods have different levels of access to information technology than offices located in lower-minority and higher-income areas.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted of pediatrics, family medicine, and general practice offices in Orange County, California. Survey data were linked with community demographic data from the 2000 Census using a geographical information system.
RESULTS: Of 307 offices surveyed, 141 responded (46%). Offices located in high-minority and high-poverty areas were as likely to respond as other offices. Among responding offices, 94% had a computer, 77% had Web access, 29% had broadband Internet access, and 53% used computerized scheduling and billing systems. Offices located in minority and low-income communities had equivalent access to each technology. Offices in communities with larger proportions of Hispanics were less likely to have practice Web pages, but other uses of the Internet were not associated with practice location. Offices reported high levels of interest in online clinical systems but also high levels of concern about these systems' usability and confidentiality. Offices with Web access and those with practice management systems expressed greater interest in online clinical systems but also greater levels of concern about usability and confidentiality. These attitudes were equivalent among offices in different communities.
CONCLUSION: Primary care offices located in poor and minority communities in a large, suburban county had high levels of access to and interest in Web-based systems. Physicians' offices may therefore provide a venue for online services aimed at improving health outcomes for poor and minority communities. Research is needed in other geographic regions to determine the generalizability of these findings.",,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,,Attitude to Computers; California; Computers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data Collection; Internet; Minority Groups; Office Automation; Physicians' Offices; Poverty Areas; Surveys and Questionnaires,2003-09-01,2003,2003-09-01,2003-09,10,5,484-493,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Bell, Douglas S.; Daly, Dianna M.; Robinson, Paul","Bell, Douglas S.

Many in academics and policy circles believe that the digital gap could further widen the economic gap between developed versus developing nations. Among the components that are taken into consideration for measuring and analyzing the digital divide between countries, the information and communication technologies (ICTs) is the key component. This paper adds to the existing body of knowledge on the issue of regional and global digital divide by profiling 192 member countries of the United Nations based on their ICT indicators.

Digital divide widens as the information society matures. It has been generally argued that digital divide is caused by individual characteristic differences: gender, generation, education, income, labor force status, class, region and etc. But digital divide is created, reproduced and aggravated through a very complex process. Given the assumption that digital divide is not a comprehensive concept converging into a single dimension, digital divide are articulated into the following four aspects: digital consciousness, digital accessibility, digital ability, digital usage. The empirical result indicates that (1)digital gap among residents were varied according to individual characteristic differences and digital divide type; (2)the result of the path analysis shows that digital ability and digital usage in digital divide factors affected significantly service quality and subjective performance; (3)digital consciousness, digital accessibility, digital ability, digital usage in digital divide factors were significant factor; (4)digital ability and digital usage were the most important factors, whereas digital consciousness is the least important factor in administrative information service. Finally, The prior conditions for the solution of digital divide are to draw upon a social consensus in order to provide more people with more information. In addition, it is necessary to devise relevant digital education content according to individual characteristic differences, and policy measures need to be taken to not simply enhance digital availability but to improve communicative competence.",,The Korean Governance Review,,,2007-08,2007,,2007-08,14,2,28-58,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Wu, Yangho; Chung, Myung-Ju","Wu, Yangho (); Chung, Myung-Ju ()",,"Wu, Yangho (); Chung, Myung-Ju ()",1,0,,0.14,https://doi.org/10.17089/kgr.2007.14.2.002,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047357032,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context",

The RAFT project was started in Western African countries 5 years ago and has now extended to other regions of Africa as well (i.e. Madagascar, Rwanda). A project for the development of a national tele-medicine network in Mali was initiated in 2001, extended to Mauritania in 2002 and to Morocco in 2003. By 2006, a total of nine countries are connected. The entire technical infrastructure is based on Internet technologies for medical distance learning and tele-consultations. The results are a tele-medicine network that has been in productive use for over 5 years and has enabled various collaboration channels, including North-to-South (from Europe to Africa), South-to-South (within Africa), and South-to-North (from Africa to Europe) distance learning and tele-consultations, plus many personal exchanges between the participating hospitals and Universities. It has also unveiled a set of potential problems: (a) the limited importance of North-to-South collaborations when there are major differences in the available resources or the socio-cultural contexts between the collaborating parties; (b) the risk of an induced digital divide if the periphery of the health system in developing countries is not involved in the development of the network; and (c) the need for the development of local medical content management skills. Particularly point (c) is improved through the collaboration between the various countries as professionals from the medical and the computer science field are sharing courses and resources. Personal exchanges between partners in the project are frequent, and several persons received an education at one of the partner Universities. As conclusion, we can say that the identified risks have to be taken into account when designing large-scale tele-medicine projects in developing countries. These problems can be mitigated by fostering South-South collaboration channels, by the use of satellite-based Internet connectivity in remote areas, the appreciation of local knowledge and its publication on-line. The availability of such an infrastructure also facilitates the development of other projects, courses, and local content creation.",The RAFT project is supported by grants from the Geneva State government and Geneva University Hospitals.

Despite extensive studies on the digital divide and its impact, developing countries, in particular, are still searching for sustainable solutions to reduce the digital gap in order to leverage their investments in information and communication technologies (ICT) toward the attainment of greater economic and social benefits and increased global competitiveness. Research has shown that the earlier focus on this phenomenon targeted physical access and diffusion of ICT as an indicator of digital readiness to reap ICT benefits. However, there has been growing attention to the effectiveness of deployment and use. In this paper we set out to extend the analysis by providing another perspective, involving a digital effectiveness framework (DEF), which describes progressive levels of capabilities and associated benefits along a path toward digital effectiveness. The DEF is derived from the theoretical foundations and scholarly work in knowledge management, diffusion of innovation, and institutionalism and includes constructs such as knowledge acquisition, access, adoption, exploitation and innovation.

The authors examine whether a racial digital divide exists among college students in the odds of their using the Internet and the different levels and types of usage. Data are from a random sample of full-time, residential college freshmen. Results indicate that aspects of a digital divide exist in terms of whether one uses the Internet for specific purposes; however, once individuals begin using the Internet, few racial differences exist. Internet experience and gender affect particular types of Internet usage, suggesting that the digital divide is multilayered.

Design/methodology/approach An analytical and comparative approach of global e‐readiness, digital opportunity, and information society indices is applied to infer the status of the digital divide in sub‐Saharan Africa.   Findings The paper finds that there is a link between bridging the digital divide and economic development. However, there is as yet no unanimity as to whether the digital divide is narrowing or widening in developing countries including those in sub‐Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, countries in sub‐Saharan Africa are making tremendous strides, especially in infrastructure development and mobile phone connectivity, to bridge the digital divide.   Research limitations/implications An empirical study is needed to determine the impact of the surge in infrastructure and policy development in sub‐Saharan Africa with regard to bridging the digital divide.   Practical implications Hitherto, attempts to measure the extent of the digital divide between and within countries have largely relied on e‐readiness rankings and have rarely used other relevant indices that are available, such as e‐government, information society, and digital opportunity indices. The use of a wide range of indices to infer the breadth and depth of the digital divide between sub‐Saharan Africa and the developed world would provide a clearer picture of the extent of the divide.

Yet, a theoretical account for the effects of the digital divide is currently lacking. This study examines three levels of the digital divide. The digital access divide (the first-level digital divide) is the inequality of access to information technology (IT) in homes and schools. The digital capability divide (the second-level digital divide) is the inequality of the capability to exploit IT arising from the first-level digital divide and other contextual factors. The digital outcome divide (the third-level digital divide) is the inequality of outcomes (e.g., learning and productivity) of exploiting IT arising from the second-level digital divide and other contextual factors. Drawing on social cognitive theory and computer self-efficacy literature, we developed a model to show how the digital access divide affects the digital capability divide and the digital outcome divide among students. The digital access divide focuses on computer ownership and usage in homes and schools. The digital capability divide and the digital outcome divide focus on computer self-efficacy and learning outcomes, respectively. This model was tested using data collected from over 4,000 students in Singapore. The results generate insights into the relationships among the three levels of the digital divide and provide a theoretical account for the effects of the digital divide. While school computing environments help to increase computer self-efficacy for all students, these factors do not eliminate knowledge the gap between students with and without home computers.

Consequently, the following phases of development are crucial for the region: (1) the phase of massive digitalization during which the digital divide is bridged and (2) the phase of information and knowledge management in which information is systematically converted into knowledge and the latter into innovative-sustainable development. Information for conversion into knowledge is supplied by the first phase. The second phase is therefore existence dependent on the first. Therefore, the attainment of digitalized state is primary-sine qua non. The envisaged digitalized state can be actualized and consolidated with a combination of: (a) curriculum in computer education consisting of computer taxonomy, networking and ICTS in general for secondary and tertiary institutions but also aptly adoptable for informal groups and (b) establishment of multipurpose telecentres in rural areas and a diffusion of networks in urban centres. Once a steady digitalized state evidenced by uninterrupted connectivity to the internet is attained, the second phase can be realized.

An overview of research published in the last 20 years draws to the conclusion that females are at a disadvantage relative to men when learning about computers or learning other material with the aid of computer-assisted software. The evidence shows that the digital divide affects people of all ages and across international boundaries. We suggest that the digital divide is fundamentally a problem of computer anxiety whose roots are deep in socialization patterns of boys and girls and that interact with the stereotype of computers as toys for boys. A model of the digital divide is presented that examines gender stereotypes, attribution patterns, and stereotype threat as antecedents of computer anxiety. Computer anxiety in turn leads to differences in computer attitudes and computer performance. A number of suggestions are offered to reduce the impact of the digital divide.",,Journal of Computer Assisted Learning,,,2006-09-05,2006,2006-09-05,,22,5,320-334,Closed,Article,"Cooper, J.","Cooper, J.

However, this high dependence on the Internet also raises sobering questions about a health digital divide, i.e. unequal access and use as well as unequal rights to gain benefits of online information among health consumers. In this paper, we discuss social, cultural and economic factors which shape a research agenda for examining health digital divide issues. These factors are derived by means of a literature review.

However, a gap in digitalization exists among different government agencies, causing unequal opportunities for accessing infrastructures, information, and communication technologies. This paper, based on Gowin’s Vee structure, is an empirical study of the digital divide in the context of local governments in Taiwan. A model for identifying and measuring aforementioned digital divide is constructed in this paper. We first refer to the grounded theory to draft a framework for measuring the digital divide in local governments. Then, through the use of a questionnaire distributed to experts implemented alongside the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), we generate five dimensions (including ICT infrastructure, human resources, external environment, internals of organization, and information) and 42 measures. Finally, we measure the actual levels of the digital divide in local governments with the resulting digital divide evaluation model. This paper aims to generate results that can serve as a reference for government agencies (at all levels) in the formulation of their digitalization strategies. Moreover, the digital divide evaluation model constructed in this study goes beyond existing measures and may serve as a reference for academics in the examination of methods to narrow the digital divide in various levels of governmental bodies. Taken together, the features of integration, comprehensiveness, and wide applicability of this proposed model can be considered the theoretical contributions to digital divide and local government hierarchy research.",,Information Systems Frontiers,,,2011-03-01,2011,2011-03-01,2012-07,14,3,693-709,Closed,Article,"Chang, She-I; Yen, David C.; Chang, I-Cheng; Chou, Jung-Chu","Chang, She-I (National Chung Cheng University, 168 University Road, 62102, Ming-Hsiung, Chia-Yi, Taiwan); Yen, David C.

Design/methodology/approach A general literature review is undertaken, along with a case study of the digital divide in an academic setting.   Findings Africa still suffers from rampant poverty, and consequently resources that could be utilised to bridge the digital divide are directed at meeting peoples basic survival needs, including food, shelter, health care, housing, etc. Additionally, governments are increasingly adopting e‐government initiatives that libraries could explore for automation.   Research limitations/implications More research is needed to show why – given that the gap between rich and poor countries is increasing, and that economic development is a good predictor of ICT uptake – that the digital divide between developed and developing countries is claimed to be narrowing.   Practical implications Libraries have the potential to use e‐government initiatives for automation, but they need to exert influence on their governments through advocacy and other measures.   Originality/value Few studies, especially in Africa, have explored the potential of e‐governance for library automation. Similarly, issues of the digital divide have in the past been looked at largely from international and national perspectives, with little attention being paid to the existence of the phenomenon within libraries. Finally, existing studies on the digital divide largely use ICT metrics without paying much attention to the totality of other variables that influence the digital divide. This paper provides a proposal on how e‐governance could be used to narrow the digital divide within libraries in Africa.",,The Electronic Library,,,2005-10-01,2005,,2005-10-01,23,5,591-602,Closed,Article,"Mutula, Stephen M.","Mutula, Stephen M.

However, few or none of the previous researches have taken into account both domestic and international digital divide issues at the same time and offered an integrated view to structurally illustrate these issues from various aspects. The goal of this paper is to propose an integrated framework for assessing and analyzing domestic and international digital divides of a country or a group of countries. Situations of digital divides in Taiwan, three other industrialized economies in southeastern Asia, and four northern European countries are examined and compared based on the framework. Related e-government strategies for bridging the divides are also discussed.",,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Electronic Government,,2004,2004,,2004,3183,,293-299,Closed,Chapter,"Yu, Chien-Chih; Wang, Hsing-I","Yu, Chien-Chih (Dept. of Management Information Systems, National ChengChi University, Taipei, Taiwan); Wang, Hsing-I (Dept. of Management Information Systems, National ChengChi University, Taipei, Taiwan; Dept. of IMS, Overseas Chinese Institute of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan)",,"Yu, Chien-Chih (National Chengchi University); Wang, Hsing-I (National Chengchi University)",4,0,,2.86,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043729182,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

The article proceeds by identifying three problematic assumptions of extant research on digital divides in the context of development: the discursive binarization between `haves' and `have-nots'; the normatization of the digital divide; and the unproblematic representation of local community interests. The article then uses a longitudinal case study of one particular Non-Government Organization (NGO) that attempted to develop a system of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) over a 10-year period. Three phases of ICT development are identified: an initial phase, a growth phase, and a consolidation phase. The historical development of ICT in the NGO is used to interrogate the three assumptions of digital divide literature, highlighting its role in organizing digital zones.

However, the corresponding measurement is still relatively imprecise. Very often it is simply reduced to comparisons of Internet penetration rates. This article extends the measurements above the usual bivariate comparisons. Within this context, three essential approaches are presented and critically evaluated. First, loglinear modeling is used to address the interactions among the factors affecting the digital divide. Second, compound measures (i.e., the Digital Divide Index) that integrate a number of variables into a single indicator are discussed. Third, time-distance methodology is applied to analyze changes in the digital divide. The article argues that these approaches often yield entirely different conclusions compared to simple bivariate analysis.

Many reports and studies have provided statistical data (Digital Divide Network, 2002; NTIA, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2000) pertaining to sociological aspects of ‘the divide,’ while some studies have examined policy issues involving universal service (Camp and Tsong, 2001) and universal access (Brewer and Chuter, 2002). Other studies have suggested ways in which the digital divide could be better understood if it were ‘reconceptualized’ in terms of an alternative metaphor, e.g. a ‘divide’ having to do with literacy (Warschauer, 2002), power (Moss, 2002), content (Carvin, 2000), or the (information) environment (Floridi, 2001). However, with the exception of Johnson (2001) and Koehler (2002), authors have tended not to question ‐ at least not directly ‐ whether the digital divide is, at bottom, an ethical issue. Many authors seem to assume that because disparities involving access to computing technology exist, issues underlying the digital divide are necessarily moral in nature. Many further assume that because this particular ‘divide’ has to do with something that is digital or technological in nature, it is best understood as a computer ethical issue. The present study, which examines both assumptions, considers four questions: (1) What exactly is the digital divide? (2) Is this ‘divide’ ultimately an ethical issue? (3) Assuming that the answer to (2) is ‘yes,’ is the digital divide necessarily an issue for computer ethics? (4) If the answer to (3) is ‘yes,’ what can/should computer professionals do bridge the digital divide?",,Journal of Information Communication and Ethics in Society,,,2003-05-01,2003,,2003-05-01,1,2,99-108,All OA; Green,Article,"Tavani, Herman T","Tavani, Herman T (Rivier College, Nashua, USA)",,"Tavani, Herman T (Rivier University)",7,1,,4.62,https://philarchive.org/rec/TAVERO,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015652973,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

In Bangladesh, the digital divide condition is severe. Therefore it is imperative for Bangladesh to take fruitful steps to bridge the digital divide and to ensure ICT facilities at the national level. Recently as government pledged to convert Bangladesh into Digital Bangladesh by 2021 which is the golden jubilee year of Bangladesh independence, several initiatives have been taken to overcome the digital divide and to produce future qualified generations. However, it has been observed that no worth mentioning project has been taken by any government that ensures proper development of public, school and college libraries. Government should realize the fact that complete development of the country is never possible unless we concentrate library based education. It is not possible for any government to ensure computer with internet connection to each and every family in Bangladesh, however, it is possible to ensure ICTs at school, college and public libraries. The author of this paper firmly believe that ensuring ICTs to public, school and college libraries will greatly reduce digital divide at the national level and will produce qualified, efficient, ICT competent future generations. In this paper an attempt has been made by the authors to show the existing digital divide in the country, current ICT scenario and core projects that have taken by government, non-government, donor agencies and other development organization. The main object of this paper is to show how public, school and college libraries can reduce digital divide at the national level. It is believed that coordinated, long-term, effective projects/programme to reduce digital divide will ensure peaceful, educated, qualified, ICT competent future generations.

In order to inform more effective policy interventions, we also attempt at identifying clusters within the country that share similar Digital Divide concerns. The results show significant disparities in the penetration of digital technologies.

Yet, not everyone has access to and is comfortable with the use of technology. This is the problem of the digital divide. This study explores the impact of the digital divide on Internet voting (I-voting). A model of I-voting and the digital divide is proposed. The proposed model suggests that age, income, education and frequency of Internet use have an impact on I-voting utilization. To test the model both an online and paper-based version of the survey was administered to a large sample of citizens. The results of multiple linear regressions indicate that age and income (access and skills) have a significant impact on Internet voting. These findings indicate that, like other e-government services, I-voting is subject to the barriers associated with the digital divide, and this digital divide introduces several challenges to government agencies.",,,2010 Fourth International Conference on Digital Society,,2010-02,2010,,,,,307-310,Closed,Proceeding,"Bélanger, France; Carter, Lemuria","Bélanger, France (Accounting and Information Systems, Virginia Tech, 3007 Pamplin Hall, Blacksburg, USA); Carter, Lemuria (School of Business and Economics name of North Carolina A & T State University, 1601 East Market Street, Greensboro, North Carolina, 27411, USA)",,"Bélanger, France (Virginia Tech); Carter, Lemuria (North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University)",13,2,,8.36,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093493232,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

Traditional village and industrialized village represent two types of rural China’s social structure, which provide a good case for studying the digital divide between different types of villages. We consider the gap formed in possessing information and communication technologies(ICTs) as the primary divide, and take the gap formed in using ICTs as the secondary divide. Moreover, a “mutual reproduction” effect exists between the divides formed in the course of possessing and using ICTs.

Design/methodology/approach The method used is an innovative form of document availability test developed to measure the extent of the digital divide between a service offered by a university library in a developed (Western) tertiary education system (Curtin University of Technology, Western Australia) and one offered by a university library in a developing Arab country (Yarmouk University, Jordan). The method tests differences in capacity to deliver content according to format (digital or print) and tests for differences in digital access to both “international” and “local” content experienced by users of the two libraries.   Findings The findings indicate the existence of a digital divide, but also suggest that the availability of digital content has helped overcome the substantial scholarly information divide.   Research limitations/implications The research has implications for academic libraries in developing Arab countries as they attempt to redress the effects of the digital divide.

Accordingly, we need to factor in the context as an important actor in conceptualizing and measuring the digital divide. Third, two general types of indices are used for the measurement of the digital divide(s): focused monotopical indices and comprehensive indices. Monotopical indices are more widely available, while comprehensive ones are rare. I argue that policymakers need to promote comprehensive indices over monotopical indices. Finally, I present a conceptual definition of the digital divide and a framework for developing a comprehensive index to measure it.","I was lucky to work on the article drafts in collaboration with Sheizaf Rafaeli, and I am grateful for all his help and mentorship.

Public Perceptions and Policy Implications,"Addressing the reasons for—and the solutions to—the “digital divide” has been on the public agenda since the emergence of the Internet. However, the term has meant quite different things, depending on the audience and the context, and these competing interpretations may in fact orient toward different policy outcomes. The goals of this article are twofold. First, the authors unpack the term “digital divide” and examine how it has been deployed and interpreted across a range of academic and policy discourses. Second, through a framing experiment embedded within a nationally representative survey, the authors demonstrate how presenting respondents with two different conceptual frames of the digital divide may lead to different perceptions of who is most accountable for addressing the issue. From this, they discuss the dynamic relationship between the construction and communication of policy discourse and the public understanding of the digital divide, as well as implications for effective communication about the digital divide and information and communication technology policy to the general public.",,The Information Society,,,2011-02-28,2011,,2011-02-28,27,2,92-104,Closed,Article,"Epstein, Dmitry; Nisbet, Erik C.; Gillespie, Tarleton","Epstein, Dmitry (Department of Communication, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA); Nisbet, Erik C.

It focuses on the use of usage and lack of usage for measuring the digital gap. The “digital gap” is defined as the gap between individuals with and without access to technology (telephones, computers, Internet access) and related services. Since its emergence, the Internet has become the most important form of information and communication technology (ICT).The goal of the present research was to develop ways of measuring Internet usage for different segments of the Israeli population (it can also be used to measure Internet usage outside Israel). For the past few years, the Israeli government has sponsored programs designed to increase Internet usage in specific segments of the Israeli population. Some of these programs have been “controlled programs”. Controlled Internet Usage Programs are planned and monitored programs, which use research methods to discover whether they have increased Internet usage and changed Internet habits.The population of Internet users in Israel is presently 45.8% (compared with 68.2% in the US population). The past 5 years has witnessed a significant rise in the number of Internet users in the West in general and in Israel specifically: an increase of 152% in the number of Israeli households connected to the Internet during the period 2000–2005.However, large differences are apparent between the stronger and weaker sections of the Israeli population where the Internet is concerned, and controlled intervention is therefore a very important means of reducing these discrepancies.The present article describes two measurement instruments: the first instrument examines on-line proficiency, while the second determines patterns of Internet use and the status of respondents’ “Internet awareness”.The instruments were built to determine the reduction in the digital divide associated with Internet usage following controlled intervention, and the population's Internet usage status before and after intervention. The difference between the two measurements represents the increase or decrease in Internet usage.These two instruments may be used by agencies making decisions about resource disbursement to reduce the digital divide in a variety of populations.",,International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,,,2006-10,2006,,2006-10,64,10,984-997,Closed,Article,"Fisher, Yael; Bendas-Jacob, Orit","Fisher, Yael (Henrietta Szold Institute, Achva Academic College, Tel-Aviv, Israel); Bendas-Jacob, Orit (Henrietta Szold Institute, Achva Academic College, Tel-Aviv, Israel)","Fisher, Yael (Achva Academic College)","Fisher, Yael (Achva Academic College); Bendas-Jacob, Orit (Achva Academic College)",5,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033243853,46 Information and Computing Sciences,

I argue that Internet policy and regulation account significantly for the persistence of digital divides in Greece. The chapter draws on literature that views the role of policy and regulation in digital inclusion as problematic and proposes a more dialectical view of the interactions between politics and technology, so that the democratic and participatory potential of the Information Society can be approached more critically. The chapter explores the research question empirically through in-depth individual interviews with elite actors in the Greek Information Society. Elite actors who are involved in various areas of policy and regulation in the Greek Information Society are in the position to account for the role of internet policy and regulation in aspects of digital exclusion from more than one perspective.

Empirical studies of broadband subscription gaps have largely used cross-sectional data, which cannot speak to the timing of technological adoption. Yet, the dynamics of a digital divide are important and deserve study. With the goal of improving our understanding of appropriate techniques for analyzing digital divides, we review econometric methodology and propose the use of duration analysis. We compare the performance of alternative estimation methods using a large dataset on DSL subscription in the U.S., paying particular attention to whether women, blacks, and Hispanics catch up to others in the broadband adoption race. We conclude that duration analysis best captures the dynamics of the broadband gaps and is a useful addition to the analytic tool box of digital divide researchers.

Using sophisticated information technologies (IT) in government has little social value if citizens are not able to use services or interact in political processes in meaningful ways. Similarly, understanding the development and use of IT in government without incorporating a demand perspective would potentially lead to partial explanations of a complex social reality. This article argues that studies about E-Government and the digital divide, which have been relatively disconnected research areas, have important parallels and potential intersections. These parallels may be useful in understanding E-Government projects and policies in a more comprehensive way and, consequently, for developing effective digital strategies. The paper reviews trajectories in E-Government and digital divide research and suggests potential implications drawn from the digital divide literature for E-Government research and practice, including model and theory development, understanding users, and some determinants of demand.","The authors want to thank Sharon Dawes, Karl Rethemeyer, and Terry Maxwell for their helpful comments and suggestions to earlier versions of this paper.

A better understanding of the determinants of broadband access at the individual level represents a key starting point for any e-inclusion policy. Based on a review of the literature on digital divide and broadband access, we document different approaches to understanding the digital divide and argue that these perspectives can also help to understand broadband access. Combining the digital divide and broadband literature provides a systematic and theory-based approach to the selection and inclusion of variables in different models. This chapter presents the results of a survey conducted in an Italian region. We provide some implications of our findings and argue that policymakers should explore the relationship between IT skills acquisition, broadband access, and Internet use in order to develop more effective policies and programs.",,,Handbook of Research on Global Diffusion of Broadband Data Transmission,,2008,2008,,,,,160-176,Closed,Chapter,"Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Papazafeiropoulou, Anastasia; Choudrie, Jyoti; Ferro, Enrico; Gil-Garcia, J.

Eleven variables providing data on 126 countries are analyzed using multivariate regression to identify which of them influence Internet usage to what extent. The used data on 126 countries refer to the year 2005. The results show that income inequality measured by the Gini coefficient is an important influencing factor besides per capita income, the degree of urbanization, and the level of democratization. The results question reductionistic digital divide approaches that analyze information inequality via focusing on a single variable (such as technology or markets). Access to ICTs is shaped by the interaction of socioeconomic, political, cultural, social, and technological factors. These results cast doubt on technological determinism, economic reductionism, and linear trend projection in the digital divide debate.

The usual conception of the digital divide as a bifurcation between the information ‘rich’ and ‘poor’ in fact does a poor job at describing the reality of the situation, which is characterized by multiple dimensions of digital divides in many contexts. Taking the lead from Albert Borgmann, it is recognized that the so-called information poor do possess a rich resource of information which needs to be fully accounted for in order to solve the global digital divide problem. In addition, making information transparent means, following the theory of development of Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto, that information should be made available and accessible through a system of representation. Floridi’s account of information ethics thus needs to be supplemented by the realization that members of infosphere, which in his view consist of information objects, should be made transparent in order that the global digital divide be ameliorated. In other words there should be a system of information about information, namely semantic representation of objective information which enables the locals to make full use of their available informational resources.",,Minds and Machines,,,2004-02,2004,,2004-02,14,1,85-99,All OA; Green,Article,"Hongladarom, Soraj","Hongladarom, Soraj (Department of Philosophy, Faculty of Arts, Chulalongkorn University, 10330, Bangkok, Thailand)",,"Hongladarom, Soraj (Chulalongkorn University)",10,0,,7.14,http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/510/mm-hongladarom.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015113631,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

The term digital divide has been used to refer to the gap between those who have access to and utilize ICT versus those who do not. Based on the literature on the digital divide and calls for broad-spectrum interdisciplinary frameworks to guide research on this topic (Lu, 2001), a conceptual framework is presented in this paper to explain the forces that often increase the digital divide as well as those that can provide the means to bridge it. Using this framework, India is used as an illustrative case to document attempts to utilize ICT to enhance the economic circumstances and quality of life for the rural and poor segments of the Indian population and to argue that government and other public institutions have an important role in bridging the digital divide in developing countries. Further, the direct role of government is distinguished from the indirect role in order to clarify and delineate the various ways in which public institutions can facilitate bridging the digital divide.",,Journal of Global Information Technology Management,,,2005-07,2005,2014-09-09,2005-07,8,3,28-46,Closed,Article,"Mistry, Jamshed J.","Mistry, Jamshed J.

In the last two decades scholars have gradually refined the conceptualization of the digital divide, moving from a dichotomous model mainly based on access, to a multidimensional model accounting for differences in usage levels and actors' perspectives. Digital divide views tend to focus on groups of users and user characteristics and focus less on different processes of use. As models of the digital divide became more complex, research focused on deepening the understanding of demographic and socioeconomic differences between adopters and non-adopters. While IT literacy is an important factor in digital divide research, and studies examine user characteristics with respect to IT literacy, few studies make the process of basic IT literacy acquisition their main focal point (Selwyn, 2005). This perspective furthers our thinking by expanding the notion of user characteristics beyond demographic and socioeconomic differences to differences in the processes leading to internet use. Based on a dataset referring to an Italian region, this paper presents a metaphorical interpretation of the digital divide in general and explores the process of IT skills acquisition in particular. Our analysis shows the key role of self-learning and the presence of three distinct approaches in IT skills acquisition leading to different needs in terms of policy. We argue that these preliminary results are a useful starting point for the design of more effective and sophisticated digital inclusion policies.",,Government Information Quarterly,,,2011-01,2011,,2011-01,28,1,3-10,All OA; Green,Article,"Ferro, Enrico; Helbig, Natalie C.; Gil-Garcia, J.

The article aims to focus on several dimensions of the digital divide that pertain to service as well as the responsibilities of libraries.   Design/methodology/approach This article places emphasis on the role of librarians and information professionals in bridging the digital divide by indicating some aspects related to it as evidenced in the literature including its definition, aspects, factors affecting, and internet users.   Findings Libraries are treated as one of the major social tools which can solve the information divide rooted in the digital divide and contribute to the realization of democratic society.   Research limitations/implications This article revolves around the authors' points of view. So, further studies, especially comparative research between developed and developing countries which vary in terms of digital divide rate, can help to understand the real role librarians and information professionals play.   Practical implications Rethinking the digital divide, librarians must redesign and redefine their service menu for their customers through thinking functionally.

The paper, being part of the tradition of critical research in IS, uses the example of managing digital divides to argue that a traditional view of management (here called heroic management) leads to conceptual problems. It will develop two basic arguments that undermine the possibility of responsible heroic management of digital divides: (1) Normative issues related to digital divides cannot be managed because management is part of the construction of the problem and therefore lacks the detached and objective viewpoint required for rational management. (2) The very concept of responsibility, if taken seriously and applied responsibly (here called reflective responsibility) requires a participative approach that contradicts the traditional top-down approach of heroic management. The paper will conclude with a discussion of what form management of IS needs to take if it wants to be responsible.",,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,Social Inclusion: Societal and Organizational Implications for Information Systems,,2006,2006,,2006,208,,231-243,All OA; Bronze,Chapter,"Stahl, Bernd Carsten","Stahl, Bernd Carsten (De Montfort University, Leicester, UK)",,"Stahl, Bernd Carsten (De Montfort University)",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F0-387-34588-4_16.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016715647,46 Information and Computing Sciences,

This paper challenges both assumptions. First, looking at various measures of the digital divide, there is a divide in per‐capita access to ICTs but developing countries show faster rates of growth in network development than developed countries. Moreover, when employing a per‐income measure of access, developing countries already “digitally leapfrog” the developed world. Second, the paper examines the prediction that disparities in absolute access to ICTs between countries will lead to reduced development prospects in poor countries. Past experience has shown that it is very difficult to make predictions of this type.

The global digital divide is a term often used to describe the gap between more and less economically developed nations, while at the national level, there is often an urban‐rural divide. In developing countries, most Internet users gain access through public access points like Internet cafés. In this article, we take a closer look at the digital divide within Tanzania. Based on a survey among Internet café users in rural, semi‐urban and central regions of the country, we find that the divide is mainly a question of finding venues with technology to access the Internet. The Internet users and usage at the different sites are surprisingly uniform, with, however, a few significant differences.",,The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,,,2007-08,2007,2017-12-05,2007-08,31,1,1-15,Closed,Article,"Furuholt, Bjørn; Kristiansen, Stein","Furuholt, Bjørn (Department of Information Systems, School of Management, Agder University College, Norway, Servicebox 422, 4604 Kristiansand, Norway); Kristiansen, Stein (Department of Economics, School of Management, Agder University College, Norway)",,"Furuholt, Bjørn (University of Agder); Kristiansen, Stein (University of Agder)",53,7,,13.73,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099624067,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems,

The Task Force outlined nine initiatives and a set of concrete action plans for implementation, which may achieve e-government readiness in developing countries. Major cultural variables, however, threaten to impede or thwart the facilitation of e-government even though many countries promote e-government policies. To examine the G-8's first effort to implement collaborative policy initiatives of the private, public, and non-profit sectors to eliminate the global digital divide, this paper will explore the relationship between six cultural variables and the implementation of the Digital Initiative to alleviate the digital divide and effect e-government readiness in developing countries.",,,Proceedings of the 35th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,,2002-01-01,2002,,2002-01-01,,,10-19,Closed,Proceeding,"Brown, Cheryl L.","Brown, Cheryl L.

The global digital divide is defined as the difference in the value of IT index (comprised of four IT adoption data: the Internet, PC, Cell phone and telephone) of a nation from the U.S. A model is proposed that contains several new indicators, not tried in the literature before. The model is then tested on Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) over a period of time. Results indicate that some of these indicators explain the existence of global digital divide.

The E-Rate program aims to bridge the digital divide in advanced telecommunications by offering services to eligible schools and libraries for educational purposes at discounted rates. Currently in its sixth cycle, the E-Rate program has provided nearly US$13 billion in discounts to eligible organizations. The program has inspired much controversy and criticism, yet studies provide evidence that the program is effectively helping to enhance the provision of services to traditionally disadvantaged communities.

However, a major concern is that the increasing use of ICT for private and public sector transactions is seen as potentially creating a “digital divide” between those with access to technology and those who do not. This paper adapts an index of the digital divide documented in previous work and utilises this instrument to analyse the depth and breadth of this phenomenon in a UK region – Wales.   Design/methodology/approach The paper discusses the construction of a “digital divide index” (DDIX) for Wales based upon the previous established work of Husing and Selhofer. The DDIX is applied to data collected as part of a major European‐wide project – UNDERSTAND.   Findings The DDIX situates four citizen segments in terms of internet access and usage – gender, age, education and income. There are no significant digital divides evident within the Welsh region in terms of gender and income. However, there are significant digital divides in terms of age and education.   Research limitations/implications The DDIX as formulated considers a limited range of possible dimensions, both in terms of citizen groups and internet access and usage. Other possible dimensions for consideration are discussed in the paper.   Practical implications Our application of a DDIX has been useful in highlighting the multi‐faceted nature of this phenomenon within a regional context. Further research is required both to refine such an important information society metric and to apply it in further domains of analysis.

An Empirical Test of a Multi-dimensional Digital Divide,"Scholars from different disciplines have recently studied a phenomenon called “the digital divide”. Since many of the new government information technology initiatives are based on Internet technologies and require the use of the Internet by citizens, understanding the digital divide (and consequently, the potential demand) is important for e-government scholars. For some researchers, the divide is not a problem and Internet access is the only relevant determinant of Internet use (access divide). For other researchers, the divide is rooted in more fundamental social differences and opportunities (multi-dimensional divide). Using data from the Piedmont region in Italy, this paper tests these two competing views of the digital divide. Overall, the models based on a multi-dimensional view have greater explanatory power and provide evidence about the relevance of multiple factors affecting both Internet access and Internet use. For instance, females use the Internet for a smaller number of activities than males. Individuals with more formal education and who can speak English use the Internet more. Finally, individuals with more experience using a PC and the Internet itself also use the Internet to perform a broader range of activities.",,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Electronic Government,,2006,2006,,2006,4084,,139-149,Closed,Chapter,"Gil-Garcia, J.

Some believe that access to technology is positively correlated to economic development and wealth creation, however, since the dawn of the last century, the gap between the rich and the poor within and between developed and developing countries has continued to grow. The protagonists in this debate do not seem to appreciate the notion that the digital divide is not about a single technology, and is driven by a complex set of factors that exist beyond wires. This paper attempts to deconstruct the concept of the digital divide beyond access to PCs, telephones, Internet, cable TV, etc… The authors argue that the phenomenon as currently conceived is misleading and flawed, and so are the indices for its measurement. Suggestions that a new model for mapping the phenomenon is made in order to bridge the divide between developed and developing countries.

The first attempts considered are mainly parameters of technical nature related with access to computers and Internet connectivity. Though these technical parameters gave an initial indication of the magnitude of the digital divide, they did not provide a complete picture of its dimension and context.

The understanding of the new paradigm of broadband penetration, sustainable development, technology adoption and community participation is fundamental to develop national plans and agendas for digital inclusion, particularly in rural and underserved populations contexts.",,Information Technology for Development,,,2011-10-17,2011,2011-10-17,2012-10,18,4,345-353,Closed,Article,"Armenta, Alvaro; Serrano, Arturo; Cabrera, Mayer; Conte, Roberto","Armenta, Alvaro (); Serrano, Arturo (); Cabrera, Mayer (); Conte, Roberto ()",,"Armenta, Alvaro (); Serrano, Arturo (); Cabrera, Mayer (); Conte, Roberto ()",54,9,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052411914,44 Human Society; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,

We adopt a generalized diffusion model that incorporates the impact of one technology's installed base on the diffusion of the other technology. We estimate the model on data from 26 developing and developed countries between 1991 and 2005. We find that the codiffusion effects between PCs and the Internet are complementary in nature and the impact of PCs on Internet diffusion is substantially stronger in developing countries as compared to developed ones. Furthermore, our results suggest that these codiffusive effects are a significant driver of the narrowing of the digital divide. We also examine the policy implications of our results, especially with respect to how complementarities in the diffusion of PC and Internet technologies might be harnessed to further accelerate the narrowing of the global digital divide.",,Information Systems Research,,,2010-12,2010,,2010-12,21,4,925-940,All OA; Green,Article,"Dewan, Sanjeev; Ganley, Dale; Kraemer, Kenneth L.","Dewan, Sanjeev (The Paul Merage School of Business and Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations (CRITO), University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California 92697); Ganley, Dale (Faculty of Business, University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia V8P 5C2, Canada); Kraemer, Kenneth L.

Digital divide advocates are concerned that demographics of broadband users will reveal the same digital divide gaps that are observed in computer ownership and home Internet access. This study analyzes the factors influencing the adoption of residential broadband services using the Current Population Survey data from September 2001. Three statistical models on computer ownership, home Internet access, and broadband access are analyzed to illustrate the differences in demographics between the dependent variables. Using a logit regression model, the results show that the digital divide is the widest for computer ownership and the narrowest for broadband access. The implications of this study are that public policy interventions to bridge the digital divide should focus more on computer ownership, and less on broadband specific policies.",,,"37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004.

We are developing a community-centred approach to learn how interaction techniques can compensate for poor communication across the digital divide. We have incorporated the lessons learned regarding social intelligence design in an abstraction and in a device called the SoftBridge. The SoftBridge allows communication to flow from endpoints through adapters, getting converted if necessary, and out to destination endpoints. Field trials are underway with two communities in South Africa: disadvantaged Deaf users and an isolated rural community. Initial lessons learned show that we have to design user interfaces that allow users to understand and cope with delay. We also learned that social concerns are often more important than the technical issues in designing such systems.","This research was supported by many organizations and people, both fellow researchers and community members.

The paper suggests that sustainable regeneration requires a much more holistic approach to urban development than has been the case in previous strategies and policies and can benefit from using digital technologies. In order to turn the digital divide into a “digital dividend,” more emphasis needs to be placed on citizen engagement, empowerment and capacity building. This case study aims to provide examples of how a multi-agency partnership approach is working to tackle these challenges through the “ONE-Manchester” initiative (Open Network E-Manchester).",,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,Organizational Dynamics of Technology-Based Innovation: Diversifying the Research Agenda,,2007-01-01,2007,,2007-01-01,235,,19-29,All OA; Bronze,Chapter,"Carter, Dave","Carter, Dave (Manchester Digital Development Agency, Manchester, UK)",,"Carter, Dave (Manchester Digital Development Agency)",3,1,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-0-387-72804-9_3.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050175624,46 Information and Computing Sciences,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

Starting from a series of elementary indicators the methodology groups these indicators into six factors of digitalization and, subsequently, aggregates the factors in a synthetic index called the synthetic index of digitalization. The dispersion in the distribution of the synthetic indexes of digitalization constitutes the measure of the digital divide. This method is based upon a measurement approach, which is different from the ones previously developed, since it uses principal components analysis for aggregating the variables and avoids many of the problems and limits shown by existing models. In the article an application of the methodology is provided within a set of ten developed countries for 2000 and 2001.

Statistics show that there are significant disparities among the populations in the developed and developing world in terms of accessibility to, and use of, ICT. Research and development in digital libraries do not only require sophisticated ICT, they also call for huge investments in terms of money and intellectual resources. Developing countries are lagging behind in digital library research and development, due to the digital divide as well as the lack of appropriate resources required for research and development. As a result, users in the developing world are being deprived of digital library services. This paper argues that some recent global digital library developments can be used by users in the developing countries : subject gateways, digital reference services, free access to e-journals and e-books in many areas, e-print archives and free digital libraries. The paper ends with an action plan that may be used by library and information professionals in both developing and developed countries to exploit the benefits of these digital information resources and services.

829,pub.1002062219,10.4018/978-1-60566-026-4.ch014,,,African-Americans and the Digital Divide,"The Internet has become an integral part of America’s entertainment, communication, and information culture. Since the mid 1990s, the Internet has become prevalent in middle and upper-class American households. Companies and government agencies are increasingly offering products, services, and information online. Educational institutions are integrating technology into their curriculum and are offering courses from a distance. However, while some are advantaged by the efficiencies and convenience that result from these innovations, others may unwittingly become further marginalized by these same innovations since Internet access is not spreading to them as quickly. The ‘digital divide’ is the term used to describe this emerging disparity. Government analysts argue that historically underserved groups such as racial and ethnic minorities, rural and low-income communities, and older Americans are at a distinct disadvantage if this divide is not closed because American economic and social life is increasingly becoming networked through the Internet (National Telecommunications and Information Administration, 1995). Over the last decade access to the Internet has increased significantly. A 2006 Pew Internet and American Life survey shows that 73% of U.S. adults (about 147 million adults) are Internet users, up from 66% (about 133 million adults) in 2005. And the share of Americans who have broadband connections at home reached 42% (about 84 million), up from 29% (about 59 million) in 2005 (Madden, 2006). African- Americans are increasingly accessing the Internet via home broadband connections, with a 121% adoption rate in 2005 (Horrigan, 2006). But does this mean that the problem of the digital divide has been solved? Is further research in this area warranted or has the digital divide become passé? In this article, we take on these questions by first reviewing major issues and trends in digital divide research. We do so by reviewing the digital divide literature as it relates to one historically underserved group, namely African-Americans. Next, we present a conceptual framework that contrasts 1) social and technological access perspectives, and 2) assetbased/ resource and behavioral/use perspectives. The article concludes with our recommendations for future research opportunities for examining digital divide issues.",,,"Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, Second Edition",,2009,2009,,,,,78-82,Closed,Chapter,"Khosrow-Pour, Mehdi; Kvasny, Lynette; Payton, Fay Cobb","Khosrow-Pour, Mehdi (); Kvasny, Lynette (The Pennsylvania State University, USA); Payton, Fay Cobb (North Carolina State University, USA)",,"Khosrow-Pour, Mehdi (); Kvasny, Lynette (Pennsylvania State University); Payton, Fay Cobb (North Carolina State University)",3,0,,1.69,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002062219,"36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3605 Screen and Digital Media; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

But what is digital or social inclusion? The purpose of this paper is to explore the notion of social exclusion as a variety of, sometimes conflicting, social programmes which embody ideas of what society should be. Becoming more aware of this variety of approach can give insights into programmes addressing the digital divide and the political, cultural and social aspects of policies of social inclusion.   Design/methodology/approach The paper analyses the notion of social inclusion as a variety of social policies to address social exclusion and develop the nation state. It uses an example of a telecentre in Jordan's knowledge station (KS) programme to illustrate and extend this analysis.   Findings The analysis and discussion of the KS initiative shows how different notions of social and digital inclusion are important features of strengthening the Jordanian state and are useful in analysing the relative success of this programme.   Originality/value The paper argues that analyses of digital divides and digital exclusion could be strengthened by a closer understanding of policies of social inclusion. In this way it is possible to move from technological connection as a measure of a digital divide to a more thorough understanding using social inclusion policy which illuminates social, political and cultural aspects of technological change.",,Journal of Information Communication and Ethics in Society,,,2009-05-01,2009,,2009-05-01,7,2/3,146-158,Closed,Article,"Al‐Jaghoub, Saheer; Westrup, Chris","Al‐Jaghoub, Saheer (Al‐Ahliyya Amman University, Amman, Jordan); Westrup, Chris (Manchester Business School, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK)",,"Al‐Jaghoub, Saheer (Al-Ahliyya Amman University); Westrup, Chris (University of Manchester)",12,2,,5.54,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033290534,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

The tempo of development in the developing world, however, is not that encouraging. One of the reasons could be the gap of digital divide among the information professionals in terms of skills and knowledge in certain areas of the information and communication technology (ICT) is expanding due to the emergent technologies. As information professionals are responsible for the effective handling of digital libraries the level of ICT skills and knowledge possessed by these professionals are critical issues that need to be addressed by the digital libraries. This paper is aimed at identifying the current level of ICT skills and knowledge among the information professionals who are working in the academic and public libraries of Malaysia.

In general, the concept represents that as technology advances, some groups within society gain greater access to more efficient technology while other groups that are unable or unwilling to participate in the use of technology are left behind. This lack of participation in the digital world is considered to place these individuals or groups at a disadvantage relative to their more connected peers. The term “digital divide” also describes information technology disparities between nations and technical accessibility disparities within smaller societal groups. Although this issue has been researched for over a decade, both the concept and proposed solutions to problems related to technology access are controversial. As the concept of a digital divide moves beyond economic issues, conflicts between technology and aesthetics are emerging as potential factors in the debate over the adoption of new technologies.",,,Encyclopedia of Information Technology Curriculum Integration,,2008,2008,,,,,738-744,Closed,Chapter,"Tomei, Lawrence A.; Juneau, Karen R.","Tomei, Lawrence A.

This perspective overlooks an important aspect of the digital divide, the lack of access and missed opportunities faced by persons with disabilities, referred to here as the “disability divide.” Barriers to access and knowledgeable use of information and communication technology (ICT) represent more than simple exclusion from information to encompass social segregation and devaluation. At its most insidious, barriers to ICTs limit full community engagement in employment activities. This chapter examines the ramification of the impact of digital divide on the nature of employment and participation in the workplace, using ICT to conduct telework, and explores challenges to social policy with respect to ‘reasonable’ accommodations. In the absence of practices, structures, and policies targeting the distributive work environment, telework is much less likely to close the digital divide for persons with a disability. This suggests the need to explore and develop potential policy options to close the disability divide.",,,Handbook of Research on Overcoming Digital Divides,,2010,2010,,,,,155-178,Closed,Chapter,"Ferro, Enrico; Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Gil-Garcia, J.

The research, conducted through questionnaires, focuses on fifth‐grade students in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area because state‐mandated test results for core subjects are available at the state Department of Education web site. Thus, it allows the researchers to collect data on both technology accessibility and academic achievement. The findings show that the digital divide still exists, cutting through various socioeconomic factors, and that the relationship between technology accessibility and academic achievement may also exist, although it is very much complicated by other compounding factors, such as the subjects of learning, the uses of technology, and socioeconomic conditions. It is hoped that the findings of this research can help policy makers, school administrators and teachers better understand the issues of digital divide and the consequences of technology use in schools and beyond.

Findings The findings were that despite having better results in terms of the causes of digital divide, the IOM trailed the UK level of internet access to a significant degree. This result raises questions about the wisdom of basing digital divide and e‐government strategies on technology proliferation and economic indicators.   Research limitations/implications The IOM is a comparatively small entity compared to the UK. In addition, basing the primary data collected on IOM civil servants only may result in an element of bias.   Practical implications Many governments invest considerable sums of money on their digital divide and e‐government programmes which may be misdirected if they are addressing the wrong causes of it.   Originality/value This paper evaluates an issue which normally requires the resources of government or institutions in order to research it.",,Transforming Government People Process and Policy,,,2007-06-01,2007,,2007-06-01,1,2,112-130,Closed,Article,"Ryder, George","Ryder, George (Advisory Ltd, Arkley, UK)",,"Ryder, George ()",4,0,,2.89,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1048565542,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

However, the information society resulted information inequality issues and especially to those disabled people, who have more difficulties on the technology adaptation, the ""digital divide"" symptom is significantly found. At present the rapid development of IT has gone beyond the level of the information society and it is accelerating the ubiquitous society that will combine people, computers, and all objects into one. And during the time of ubiquitous the ""digital divide"" will still exist. This research is focused on the digital divide of disabled people that were insufficiently covered in the research of digital divide and ubiquitous. From the empirical study of the effect that the disabled contributes on the service usability in U-City, the factors of background of the digital divide, and the difference of such factors in types of sex, ages, disabled types, and disabled class, and finally how the ubiquitous divide of the disabled affects have been researched. Based on the proposed study model and by analyzing the model by structural equation, following resulted was gained. (1) With the TAM (TAM : Technology Acceptance Model), which is commonly used in the studies of IT devices and services, the digital divide of the disabled cases cannot be identified sufficiently since it is not eligible for Using Intention of U-City Services. (2) In case of the disabled, the mental factors like willingness to overcome the impediment and accessibility like environment to meet the information services and ability to access the services are more effective on Using Intention of U-City Services rather than TAM.",,The Journal of Information Systems,,,2008-06-30,2008,,2008-06-30,17,2,95-112,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Lee, Mi-Gyeong; Kang, Ju-Young; Lee, Sang-Gun","Lee, Mi-Gyeong (); Kang, Ju-Young (); Lee, Sang-Gun ()",,"Lee, Mi-Gyeong (); Kang, Ju-Young (); Lee, Sang-Gun ()",1,0,,0.24,http://koreascience.or.kr:80/article/JAKO200824556525216.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002297389,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems",10 Reduced Inequalities; 3 Good Health and Well Being

The empirical results show that the digital divide, on one hand, widens the growth gap between countries. On the other hand, the global ICT diffusion generates ICT externalities, which have positive effects on the total factor productivity of less-developed countries. Therefore, the global digitalization may have both negative impacts, manifested in a widening digital divide and growth gap, and positive impacts reflected in the effects of knowledge spillovers. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,Information Technology for Development,,,2006-04,2006,2010-03-03,2006-04,12,2,159-173,Closed,Article,"Seo, Hwan‐Joo; Lee, Young Soo","Seo, Hwan‐Joo (Department of Economics, Sangji University, 660 Woosan‐Dong, Wonju Kangwon‐Do, 220–702, Korea); Lee, Young Soo (Department of Business Administration, Hankuk Aviation University, 200–1 Whajon‐Dong, Koyang Kyongki‐Do, 412–791, Korea)",,"Seo, Hwan‐Joo (Sangji University); Lee, Young Soo (Korea Aerospace University)",21,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001267604,44 Human Society; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

In this regards, it is urgent to shape policies to address a digital divide between the young and the old. The study is to analyze the factors affecting the digital divide in a theoretical and empirical way, providing policy alternatives to narrow the digital divide. The study is summarized as follows: The analysis of the status of digital divide between the young and the old shows the Internet usage by the elderly (that is, those over 50 years old) is 28.3%, significantly lower than that by the young. Moreover, as the age becomes higher, the usage rate tends to be rapidly decreasing. In particular, the usage rate is much lower among those with lower education, lower income, and non-office jobs. Also, the empirical analysis of the usage and utilization of information goods by the aging population reveals that people tend to be reluctant adopting and utilizing the information technology as it gets older, making it necessary to support the utilization of information goods as well as the adoption. Based on the analysis, the study provides ways to bridge the digital divide between the young and the old from the following three perspectives. First, for the information approach, it is required to provide low-end or used personal computers with Internet connection; develop and support technologies ensuring universal access to the information resources; and supply new devices available as telecommunications and broadcasting becomes converged and the digital broadcasting is introduced. Second, to boost the information technology proficiency of the elderly, it is needed to provide IT training programs for the older people with the support from the private sector; reinforce the customized IT education and training programs; come up with a variety of ways of providing education; and have advanced IT programs, in order to promote the elderly's participation in the economy. Third, to encourage the utilization of information technology, it is necessary to create jobs and provide relevant information to the aging population, promoting their participation in the economy; support the older people utilize IT facilities, upgrading the welfare services; and develop content for education and lifelong education programs.",,The e-Business Studies,,,2009-11,2009,,2009-11,10,4,319-350,Closed,Article,"Noh, Yong-Hwan; 김원중; 김정언","Noh, Yong-Hwan (); 김원중 (); 김정언 ()",,"Noh, Yong-Hwan (); 김원중 (); 김정언 ()",3,1,,0.75,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037137974,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems",4 Quality Education

E-services improve the responsiveness, efficiency and transparency of the public sector. Unfortunately, these benefits may not be realized by the entire population. A digital divide exists in society, both from an access point of view and from a skills point of view. This study explores the potential effects of the digital divide on e-government by surveying a diverse group of citizens to identify the demographic characteristics that impact use of e-government services. The results indicate that income, education, age and frequency of Internet use significantly impact the use of e-government services.

By focusing on the implementation of the two projects, the chapter illustrates their contribution in practically using the broadband technologies in overcoming the hurdles to bridging the digital divide, and highlights the critical success factors as identified during the functioning of the projects which helped the states in achieving their goals. The chapter also reveals through its analysis that the accessibility of services through broadband technology have brought an opportunity to the citizens to become a part of the current knowledge revolution, besides bringing about a great technological transformation to the areas where it is implemented, and thus contributed to bridging the digital divide. The chapter is finally concluded by proving that moving from a manual to electronic process with broadband technology as an enabler; the States set an example, which will serve as a set of guidelines for application of similar projects in other geographical settings.",,,Handbook of Research on Global Diffusion of Broadband Data Transmission,,2008,2008,,,,,30-46,Closed,Chapter,"Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Papazafeiropoulou, Anastasia; Choudrie, Jyoti; Radhakumari, Challa","Dwivedi, Yogesh K.

804,pub.1002252553,10.1080/13600810500137889,,,"Policy Reform, Economic Growth and the Digital Divide","Rapid growth of internet use in high-income economies has raised the spectre of a “digital divide” that will marginalize developing countries because they can neither afford internet access nor use it effectively when it is available. Using a new cross-country data set, this paper investigates two proximate determinants of the digital divide: internet intensity (internet subscriptions per telephone mainline); and access to telecom services. Surprisingly, no gap in internet intensity was found. When differences in urbanization and competition policy are controlled for, low-income countries have intensities as high as those of industrial countries. While income does not seem to matter in this context, competition policy matters a great deal. Low-income countries with high World Bank ratings for competition policy have significantly higher internet intensities. The paper's finding on internet intensity implies that the digital divide is not really new, but reflects a persistent gap in the availability of mainline telephone services. After identifying mobile telephones as a promising new platform for internet access, the paper uses panel data to study the determinants of mobile telephone diffusion during the past decade. The results show that income explains part of the diffusion lag for the poor countries, but they also highlight the critical role of policy. Developing countries whose policies promote economic growth and private sector competition have experienced much more rapid diffusion of mobile phone service. Simulations based on the econometric results suggest that feasible reforms could sharply narrow the digital divide during the next decade for many countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.",,Oxford Development Studies,,,2005-06,2005,2007-01-23,2005-06,33,2,229-243,Closed,Article,"Dasgupta, Susmita; Lall, Somik; Wheeler, David","Dasgupta, Susmita (Development Research Group, The World Bank, 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20433, USA); Lall, Somik (Development Research Group, The World Bank, 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20433, USA); Wheeler, David (Development Research Group, The World Bank, 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20433, USA)",,"Dasgupta, Susmita (World Bank); Lall, Somik (World Bank); Wheeler, David (World Bank)",85,4,,22.66,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002252553,38 Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies,

804,pub.1052407559,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2010.11.004,,,Understanding the new digital divide—A typology of Internet users in Europe,"The purpose of this study is to better understand the digital divide by identifying the variety of ways in which people in Europe use the Internet. First, by using cluster analysis on survey data (N=12,666/age: 16–74 years) from Eurostat on Internet usage in Norway, Sweden, Austria, the UK, and Spain, we identified five user types: Non-Users (42%), Sporadic Users (18%), Instrumental Users (18%), Entertainment Users (10%), and Advanced Users (12%). These user types differ in their distributions over country, age, access, household members, and gender. An alarming finding is that 60% of the population was found to be either Non-Users or Sporadic Users, which reflects a large digital divide in Europe. Second, we conducted a logistic regression to identify the predictors for different user types. We found on a cross-national level that age and Internet access are the most salient predictors, whereas gender and household seems to be less relevant. However, the amount of variance explained differs between countries. We also suggested a future increase in the digital divide between the identified user types—a user type divide. The user typology and the identified predictors might help researchers, practitioners, and decision makers to better understand Internet users and the multi-complex variations among individuals and countries. This knowledge will also serve as a means to understand the digital divide by providing a more nuanced perspective on Europeans' unequal usage of the Internet and participation in an increasingly digital society.","The research leading to these results received funding from the European CITIZEN MEDIA project (038312) FP6-2005-IST, the RECORD-project (180135/S10), supported by the VERDIKT Program of the Research Council of Norway, and the R2D2 Networks project (193018; CELTIC and VERDIKT program).

This paper argues that a knowledge-based approach provides an effective means to understand and develop responses to various forms of disadvantage related to access and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). In developing this idea one area of social network analysis is used to make the claim that social networks are used by people to configure an ontology to negotiate the uncertainty of their day-to-day existence. It follows then that digital divide factors can be understood in terms of ICT facilitated knowledge development and related processes.

793,pub.1041044173,10.1108/13287260810897738,,,Barriers to ICT adoption in SMEs: how to bridge the digital divide?,"The purpose of this paper is to report findings of a study conducted on micro and small enterprises (SMEs) from selected regions of Spain, Portugal and Poland, and to compare them with the results of a similar survey carried out in California (USA). The European and US research studies focus on issues regarding the use of information and communication technology (ICT) solutions by SMEs and digital divide phenomena which exist between SMEs and large corporations. The data collected during face‐to‐face interviews with SMEs' owner–managers and employees from Spain, Portugal, Poland and the USA were used for making a comparative analysis based on descriptive statistical methods. Analyzing the barriers that discourage SMEs from using information and communication technology (ICT) and e‐Business solutions in their business processes made it possible to identify the reasons for SMEs being on the “wrong side” of the digital divide. The paper argues that the main barrier to better utilization of ICT and e‐Business, and thus the main reason why SMEs face a digital divide, is not so much the lack of access to information technology (“material access” barrier) as the lack of proper knowledge, education and skilled owner‐managers and employees within the enterprise (“skills access” barrier). As long as European SMEs do not realize this fact, so long will the scale of the digital divide in Europe continue to grow. The main limitation of the approach presented in this paper is related to the sample differences between Spain, Portugal, Poland and the USA. This made it impossible to carry out precise comparative statistical analysis of the results. Despite these methodological imperfections, it was possible to put forward certain recommendations on the directions of activities focusing on enhancing e‐Business adoption in SMEs. The main conclusion is that the actions aimed at bridging the digital divide in SMEs should concentrate on overcoming the “skills access” and “usage access” barriers within SMEs, not the material ones. The comparison of the way these problems are perceived by European and US owner‐managers is an added value of the paper, which brings new content to the existing discussion on barriers to the implementation of ICTs in SMEs. This approach is a step forward in analyzing the determinants and the mechanism of the digital divide within SMEs and has the potential to diminish the scale of this problem.",,Journal of Systems and Information Technology,,,2008-08-15,2008,,2008-08-15,10,2,93-108,Closed,Article,"Arendt, Lukasz","Arendt, Lukasz (Department of Economic Policy, University of Łódź Łodz, Poland)",,"Arendt, Lukasz (University of Łódź)",80,25,,19.06,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041044173,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems",

So much so that it has been said that the digital divide makes the segment of society on the “right side” of the divide (the digitally endowed group) better off and that on the “wrong side” (the digitally challenged group) worse off. This is not always true, however, in a social choice situation where members of a society collectively choose one alternative from a set of alternatives. To identify conditions when this does not hold, a model of the digital divide is setup in which the digitally endowed group receives better information than the digitally challenged group. Preferences of all individuals over outcomes are distributed over a scale. This distribution is correlated with the digital divide: the outcome preferred by the digitally endowed group differs from that preferred by the other group. The alternative chosen by majority becomes the choice of the overall society. The ensuing analysis shows that individuals located centrally on the preference scale are sensitive to information about the state. The choice of centrally located digitally challenged individuals, made on a lack of information, makes the digitally challenged group worse off as has been predicted before. In some cases, the digitally endowed group is worse off as well. In the case of highly polar alternatives, social welfare decreases due to the welfare loss of the digitally endowed group. Results suggest that policymakers must manage the digital divide in a customized manner depending on the preferences context. They should not only focus on improving the welfare of the digitally challenged, but also focus on the welfare of the digitally endowed group so that this welfare does not decrease.",,Government Information Quarterly,,,2009-04,2009,,2009-04,26,2,377-386,Closed,Article,"Kim, Eunjin; Lee, Byungtae; Menon, Nirup M.","Kim, Eunjin (Kyonggi University, Korea 94-6, Yiui-dong, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon, Republic of Korea); Lee, Byungtae (Graduate School of Management of KAIST 207-43, Cheongryangri-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Menon, Nirup M.

Design/methodology/approach The article critically examines the Networked Readiness Index in terms of its presentation and its underlying model. It relies on an approach to policy analysis that views policy problems as socially constructed.   Findings E‐readiness assessment tools purport to show how ready the nations of the world are to exploit the potential of new information and communication technologies. Yet they do more than that; being actively engaged in constructing policy problems. In the case of the NRI, the problem of the international digital divide is defined in a particular way that privileges certain interests while at the same time legitimatizing its inclusion on the agenda of international organizations as a problem worthy of sustained attention.   Practical implications The findings of the article suggest a need for alternative indicators that register the voices of a wider range of groups and could therefore create a more inclusive digital divide policy problem.   Originality/value Little critical (as opposed to technical) analysis of e‐readiness indicators exits in the literature.

Correspondence courses using printed material and postal mail have been replaced by Web-based courses with the potential to make learning available to anyone, anywhere at anytime. This potential cannot be realized, however, unless two digital divides are eliminated. Some people are on the wrong side of the first “digital divide” between the technology “haves” and the technology “have-nots”. The benefits of technology are less available to those who are poor, who live in rural areas, who are members of minority racial or ethnic groups, and/or who have disabilities (Kaye, 2000; U.S. Department of Commerce, 1999). Lack of access to new technologies limits their options for taking and teaching technology-based courses. This is true for individuals with disabilities, even though the rapid development of assistive technology makes it possible for an individual with almost any type of disability to operate a computer (2003 Closing the Gap Resource Directory, 2003). Unfortunately, many people with disabilities still do not have access to these empowering tools, putting them on the “have not” side of the first digital divide.",,,"Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, First Edition",,2005,2005,,,,,3079-3084,Closed,Chapter,"Khosrow-Pour, Mehdi; Burgstahler, Sheryl","Khosrow-Pour, Mehdi (); Burgstahler, Sheryl (University of Washington, USA)",,"Khosrow-Pour, Mehdi (); Burgstahler, Sheryl (University of Washington)",2,2,,0.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041292375,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,4 Quality Education

This research often describes the digital divide as yet another symptom of the current socio-economic division in our society. Based on this research, one would expect that online government services targeting the lower income population would not become a policy focus. However, around the United States, programs are being adopted to provide e-government services to low-income populations who are receiving public welfare benefits. This raises a question as to whether this population can avail itself of e-government services and whether e-government services generally serve to create differences in government service provision between the wealthy and better educated compared to the poor and less educated. Our findings indicate that, as would be expected in the American context, there is a digital divide gap between these two populations. This gap begins with access to the Internet but also extends to the use of e-government services among those who have Internet access. We see that education and income are strong predictors of both the use of e-government services and the volume of e-government services used. This has implications for the expansion and use of e-government in the U. S. and internationally.",,,Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance - ICEGOV '11,,2011,2011,,2011,,,37-44,Closed,Proceeding,"Hall, Thad E.; Owens, Jennifer","Hall, Thad E.

We examine to what extent these factors contribute to the digital divide between different social groups in Serbia. We use the panel data from the survey “ICT usage in Republic of Serbia” in 2006 and 2007, covering over 3000 individuals/households, to perform a quantitative analysis of the digital divide and ICT adoption. Based on a classification tree and a logistic regression model, a profile of the typical ICT adopter and non-adopter is identified. The empirical results show the following: (i) the digital divide between age group 55-74 and those younger that 55 slightly increased in 2007 in case of regular Internet use; (ii) at the individual level the ICT adoption (use of PC, Internet and mobile phones) in Serbia is mainly influenced by the income and wealth of an individual, its computer and Internet skills and age; (iii) this result is quite robust across the methodological approaches used; and (iv) the classification tree approach is preferable since it gives the same predictive accuracy as the logistic regression with a more parsimonious model.

It proposes that critical mass is effective on the adoption of both general and specialized computer applications, and diffusions from channels of workplace and schools are significant. However, critical mass has stronger influence on general applications in early stage while exerts stronger impact on specialized applications in late stage of the diffusion process. In contrast, diffusions from workplace and schools are generally stronger in late stage rather than in early stage.

This allows the seller to more efficiently market its goods to each consumer segment. We show conditions under which low-type consumers are initially served in the offline channel, but subsequently bridging the divide results in their not being served in either channel.

Some have described the gap between those with power to use and create digital information and those who do not as a “digital divide.” How can we use the potential of information technology to birth a new social revolution on a global scale? How can we bridge the digital divide? The answers lie in a reevaluation of science and technology to include us all. This chapter explores the problem from a feminist perspective and proposes a variety of solutions.",,,Diversity in Information Technology Education,,2006,2006,,,,,38-67,Closed,Chapter,"Trajkovski, Goran; Kirk, Mary","Trajkovski, Goran (); Kirk, Mary (Metropolitan State University)",,"Trajkovski, Goran (); Kirk, Mary (Metropolitan State University)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1044041895,"46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems; 4610 Library and Information Studies; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

To explore the possibility of digital leapfrogging by an emerging region, this study looks at the three domains of hardware, software and connectivity. In each domain the default technology and its potential is evaluated as a digital inclusion tool while being juxtaposed with the latest “cutting-edge” alternative that could be used instead for “leapfrogging”. Three specific scenarios are developed in telephony, banking and the World Wide Web, which illustrate how a combination of these different technologies help emerging regions ‘leapfrog the digital divide.’ Finally, the paper suggests certain leapfrogging trajectories that ICT4D projects should explore.",,International Journal of Information Communication Technologies and Human Development,,,2011-10-01,2011,,2011-10-01,3,4,17-30,Closed,Article,"Ranganathan, Kavitha","Ranganathan, Kavitha ()",,"Ranganathan, Kavitha ()",1,0,,0.38,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038616302,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4601 Applied Computing,

Therefore, in recent years numerous attempts have been done to develop e-readiness and digital divide models oriented toward certain objectives. In this research, these models are investigated with view to their definitions and methodologies, and their strengths and weaknesses are identified. These findings can help researchers and policymakers select the models that fit in with their objectives as well as identify the defects of previous models and rectify them in their own models. Moreover, the extensive literature review led to an integrated model which is proposed to assess the e-readiness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Such a model can serve as a basis and standard for developing comprehensive models in SMEs.",,International Journal of E-Adoption,,,2009-07-01,2009,,2009-07-01,1,3,1-29,Closed,Article,"Hanafizadeh, Mohammad Reza; Hanafizadeh, Payam; Saghaei, Abbas","Hanafizadeh, Mohammad Reza (); Hanafizadeh, Payam (); Saghaei, Abbas ()",,"Hanafizadeh, Mohammad Reza (); Hanafizadeh, Payam (); Saghaei, Abbas ()",4,0,,1.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013392185,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems",

He suggests that in countries where the divide is falling, incomes will tend to be relatively high, and vice versa in the case of a rising divide. This relationship is examined on the basis of simple regression analysis; the analysis indicates the hypothesis is true with a high level of significance. Interpretation of the findings is carried out mainly in relation to countries from Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. In short, recent changes in the digital divide are associated with global inequality rather than equality, although there are some important anomalies that need to be explained.",,The Information Society,,,2011-02-28,2011,,2011-02-28,27,2,121-128,Closed,Article,"James, Jeffrey","James, Jeffrey (Department of Economics, Tilburg University, Tilburg, the Netherlands)","James, Jeffrey (Tilburg University)","James, Jeffrey (Tilburg University)",30,3,,9.12,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025626810,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing; 4610 Library and Information Studies",10 Reduced Inequalities

We show how the digital divide, where high type consumers dominate the online channel and low type consumers dominate the offline channel, artificially segments the marketplace thereby mitigating the classic cannibalization problem. This allows the seller to more efficiently market its goods to each consumer segment. We show conditions under which low type consumers are initially served in the offline channel, but subsequently bridging the divide results in low type consumers not being served in either channel. We also examine the implications of bridging the digital divide when the seller uses delay by engaging in intertemporal price discrimination.",,,"37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004.

Identifies some international initiatives to develop ICT infrastructure and proposes the development of telecenters, techmobiles and technology resource centers, and the use of the ‘old boy network' or ‘past students' associations’, to provide access to digital technology. Identifies the need to create Internet content in African languages, developing African language keyboards and conduct needs assessments of local users. Makes proposals for training teachers to teach information literacy skills, involving libraries in information literacy skills development and instituting mass information literacy programs. Concludes that implementing these approaches to closing the digital divide calls for strategic interventions by governments.",,Information Development,,,2005-02,2005,2016-06-30,2005-02,21,1,22-30,Closed,Article,"Gyamfi, Alexander","Gyamfi, Alexander (State University of New York at Albany.

This exploratory study aims to examine the relationships between demographic and situational variables and small and medium‐sized enterprise (SME) owners' intentions to adopt and use free public wifi technology.   Design/methodology/approach A survey study of 158 SME owners in the urban renewal community (RC) of a large Southwestern metroplex investigated the influence of known digital divisors – gender, ethnicity, age, education, and experience – on the adoption and use of wi‐fi technologies. Partial least squares was used to test the hypotheses.   Findings Contrary to previous research, gender, age, education, and experience were not related to the intention to adopt wifi technology. Ethnicity was significantly related to intent to adopt, but the relationship was small. Ethnicity and age were found to be somewhat related to wifi usage. In marked contrast from earlier research, education, gender, and experience were not significant predictors of usage.   Practical implications The findings suggest that access to high‐speed wifi has the potential to reduce and/or eliminate the digital divide. The projected changes in the digital divide can be expected to make a significant impact on SME productivity and performance.   Originality/value This study is one of the first to examine the influence of the adoption and use of public wi‐fi technologies by SME owners on the digital divide.",,Information Technology and People,,,2010-03-02,2010,,2010-03-02,23,1,4-22,Closed,Article,"Middleton, Karen L.; Chambers, Valrie","Middleton, Karen L.

There are myriad compelling reasons why information technology (IT) managers and companies that are dependent on IT should support efforts to decrease the digital divide. First and foremost, full participation in life in the information age requires computer literacy and Internet access. Computer-literate people are more likely to have an interest in IT-related careers, require less on-the-job training, contribute higher value to their employers, participate in e-government, and raise computer-literate children. The availability of applications such as electronic commerce, electronic payment, brokering services, and collaborative engineering to strengthen the relationships among manufacturers, suppliers, developers, and customers has grown rapidly. The potential convergence of wireless technology, television, and virtual reality is what the future has in store. As a result of the failure of so many e-commerce companies at the turn of the century, the momentum of the information age has stalled. E-business practices are becoming rather widely adopted in most industry. Actions that have been successful for many organizations to overcome the digital divide include contributing funds or equipment to local and regional programs and providing internships for local schools that have information technology programs.",,,Socially Responsible IT Management,,2003,2003,,2003,,,289-319,Closed,Chapter,"Erbschloe, Michael","Erbschloe, Michael ()",,"Erbschloe, Michael ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005752507,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems",

However, no such meeting support was available to the breakout sessions at the January 2003 meeting of The United Nations information and communication technologies (UNICT) task force to discuss the digital divide as it affects Caribbean community and common market (CARICOM) countries. Whereas group support systems (GSS) have been widely discussed in the literature, there is no evidence of their use in the English‐speaking Caribbean, a situation which may be classified as another instance of the digital divide. Against this backdrop, we examine the process of organizational decision‐making within groups, the factors influencing group behaviors and interaction and the advantages and disadvantages of structuring mechanisms such as the technology‐enabled GSS and the manual, nominal group technique (NGT). The paper concludes that it is desirable for Caribbean nations to acquire GSS technology to reap some of the benefits that other developing countries have experienced. However, despite its runner‐up status (to GSS), NGT provides similar assistance to that offered by GSS, is implementation‐friendly, inexpensive, and outperforms other manual techniques in creative decision‐making; it is therefore a viable alternative for Caribbean nations struggling to bridge the digital divide.",,The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,,,2004-04,2004,2017-12-05,2004-04,17,1,1-23,Closed,Article,"Duggan, Evan W.; Virtue, Grace","Duggan, Evan W.

This paper shows that the divide looks differently from what was previously thought for the fastest-growing developing countries—Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) based on 2006 data. While mobile technology depth (number subscriptions as percentage of population) is lower in BRIC, it has been rapidly growing, equaling, or surpassing some developed countries for BRIC such as Russia and Brazil. BRIC such as India and Russia also equal or surpass several developed countries in 2006 in terms of mobile technology breadth (service variety) on 34 individual and five categories of mobile services available worldwide. While some BRIC may be behind developed countries on one of these dimensions in 2006, they are ahead on the other dimension. Thus, the digital divide between BRIC and developed countries can be narrower, absent, or even reversed, depending on the metric used. This paper argues that BRIC can serve as frontrunners whose lessons on technology diffusion can be applied in other developing countries. The paper presents implications for new product and innovation management and digital divide research and for policy making and business processes for high-tech companies in BRIC and other developing countries.",,Journal of Product Innovation Management,,,2009-07,2009,,2009-07,26,4,455-466,Closed,Article,"Chircu, Alina M.; Mahajan, Vijay","Chircu, Alina M.

The computers and internet connections are available almost at every part ofMalaysia including those in the remote areas. However; to have a real impact of technology on people slives, the effort has to go beyond the infrastructures and technology literacy programs and awareness. Having information available suit to the needs of the local community will bring greater impact ofthe technology to them. Nevertheless, the new approaches need to be introduced to make the effort less costly. Some of the Digital Divide programs require proper coordination with other projects. Coordination with the responsible agencies in providing power utilities and road infrastructures is essential to make such expensive digital divide program more cost effective·and give greater impact to the community. Thus, this paper will provide numerous suggestions on the improvement in providing greater benefits; both the users and the project implementers. Besides, this paper will also discuss on the need of local content in local language with self-sustained nature. lt further highlights the importanceof having basic infrastructure such as electricity and road accessibility that may have influence over the success of BDD program.",,Social and Management Research Journal,,,2010-06-01,2010,2010-06-01,,7,1,23,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Hassan, Roshidi; Megat Tajuddin, Megat Zuhairy","Hassan, Roshidi (); Megat Tajuddin, Megat Zuhairy ()",,"Hassan, Roshidi (); Megat Tajuddin, Megat Zuhairy ()",0,0,,0.0,http://myjms.mohe.gov.my/index.php/SMRJ/article/download/5184/1963,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113633100,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems,

773,pub.1039584655,10.1080/15228053.2010.10856195,,,Digital Divide And Equity In Education: A Rawlsian Analysis,"In his magnum opus, ""A Theory of Justice"" (1971), John Rawls, one of the most influential American philosophers of the twentieth century, emphasizes two principles of justice, one that ensures equal liberties and the second equal opportunity for all irrespective of their status. The most important part of the second principle known as the ""difference principle"" addresses social inequity by recommending institutional support for the under-privileged segment of the society. These principles of justice serve as guidelines for political institutions to ensure equality of basic political and civil rights and equity in the social and economic conditions. To facilitate equity, Rawls places significant emphasis on the formal notion of ""justice"" over its substantive notion which is ""fairness. "" If fairness could be achieved in the process of institutionalising justice in any socio-political system then it would reach the position of ""reflective equilibrium "" which is an ideal condition for any just system. This paper would attempt to apply the Rawlsian principles of justice in the context of the emerging inequitable situation in the education sector and web based education in India. The emerging issue of ""digital divide"" widens the disparity among the society in education and economic sectors. The burgeoning fields of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and the scope of ICT in education at various levels create a complex situation, when resources and opportunities remain inaccessible to the poor. Inequity due to digital divide assumes significance and requires urgent attention of the policy makers, administrators and community as the Indian government has been actively implementing massive schemes in education and rural development, to ensure accessibility, availability and affordability of education and economic opportunities to all citizens of the country. The paper analyses how accessibility to web based learning enhances opportunities for the educated sector and its inaccessibility implies ""injustice"" to the deprived sector of the society. The efforts of the government to bridge the digital divide could lead to a rapid improvement in the social, political and economic conditions of the poor and underprivileged strata in India. In this paper, the efforts of the Indian government to bridge the digital divide are highlighted and effective measures to tackle inequity due to the digital divide are suggested.",,Journal of Information Technology Case and Application Research,,,2010-10,2010,2014-09-12,2010-10,12,4,37-62,Closed,Article,"Anthony, Josephine; Padmanabhan, Sudarsan","Anthony, Josephine (Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT-Madras, India); Padmanabhan, Sudarsan (Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT-Madras, India)",,"Anthony, Josephine (); Padmanabhan, Sudarsan ()",2,1,,0.68,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039584655,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems,"10 Reduced Inequalities; 16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 4 Quality Education"

The path analysis suggests four main findings. First, socio-demographic conditions strongly matter for e-government use. Younger generations and socioeconomically advantaged people use e-government more than their counterparts. Second, perceived usefulness of e-government contributes to actual use of e-government. Third, the effect of trust in government on e-government adoption is indirect through perceived usefulness rather than directly causal. Those with higher levels of trust in overall government would likely perceive value of e-government, and then those who perceive potential benefits from using e-government adopt e-government. Last, Internet use intensity is highly associated with e-government use intensity.",,,Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance - ICEGOV '11,,2011,2011,,2011,,,27-36,Closed,Proceeding,"Nam, Taewoo; Sayogo, Djoko Sigit","Nam, Taewoo (University at Albany, State University of New York); Sayogo, Djoko Sigit (University at Albany, State University of New York)",,"Nam, Taewoo (University at Albany, State University of New York); Sayogo, Djoko Sigit (University at Albany, State University of New York)",20,3,,6.96,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028219836,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

In addition, we examine the relationships between specific combinations of technologies and the factors explaining them. Although income is a key factor for all country groups, its role is more significant for middle-digitalization countries. Using several multivariate techniques, we detect different patterns of digitalization. The patterns are explained to differing degrees by the type of country, by differences in economic development, and by socio-demographic and institutional variables. Factors such as quality of regulation and infrastructure explain ICT adoption in high-income countries. The ICT combination associated with specific income groups as well as the explanatory variables detected for each of them might be useful to implement the most appropriate policy actions to reduce the digital divide.",,Review of World Economics,,,2010-02-07,2010,2010-02-07,2010-04,146,1,39-73,All OA; Green,Article,"Billon, Margarita; Lera-Lopez, Fernando; Marco, Rocío","Billon, Margarita (Department of Economic Development, Autonomous University of Madrid, Carretera de Colmenar Viejo, Km 15, 28049, Madrid, Spain); Lera-Lopez, Fernando (Department of Economics, Public University of Navarre, Campus Arrosadía s/n, 31006, Pamplona, Spain); Marco, Rocío (Department of Applied Economy, Autonomous University of Madrid, Carretera de Colmenar Viejo, Km 15, 28049, Madrid, Spain)","Lera-Lopez, Fernando (Universidad Publica de Navarra)","Billon, Margarita (Autonomous University of Madrid); Lera-Lopez, Fernando (Universidad Publica de Navarra); Marco, Rocío (Autonomous University of Madrid)",59,22,,11.48,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00563602/file/PEER_stage2_10.1007%252Fs10290-009-0045-y.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1020913051,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context",

Policy makers worldwide clearly declare that the main aim of their technology diffusion strategies is the elimination of the gap between ‘haves‘ and ‘have-nots’ in the cyberspace. In this paper we extent previous research on the application of the stakeholder analysis in electronic commerce policy making [1] by focusing on its normative aspect. According to this aspect it is ethically appropriate for policy makers to consider all stakeholders, which are relevant to their strategies.

Two main and interrelated strands of evidence are presented: First, contrary to expectations that rising income per capita will tend to reduce wealth and wage disparities, the distribution of income and wealth both between countries and individuals has sharply skewed in the information age; second, knowledge production is a self-reinforcing cycle that tends to disproportionately reward some and exclude others. The so-called digital divide is as much a symptom and a cause of these broader techno-economic phenomena, and regarding it as a simple issue of connectivity is simplistic and reductive.","Thanks are due to Anthony D&#x27;Costa, T.

The analysis is based on a 2003 telephone survey of 1,123 firms with fewer than 50 employees and at least one computer, and in-depth interviews with 45 business owners. The analysis provides no evidence of a business digital divide across racial, ethnic, and gender groups. In fact, firms owned by African-American males show more intensive computer use than white male-owned firms, even after controlling for firm and owner characteristics.

However, these progressive steps are yet to reach millions of disabled persons in rural Bangladesh. Around 13 million people in Bangladesh are physically handicapped of which 3 million are children. Disability is increasing with population growth and ageing. Disability on this scale represents not only a major health issue but also a prime cause of poverty and underdevelopment. Information and Communication Technology (ICT), opens up great opportunities to improve the quality of life of disabled people failing which will further the digital divide. This paper proposes to discuss the importance of ICT development and accessibility for persons with disabilities in Bangladesh and elaborate on how ICT has been utilized thus far and how we can further these initiatives towards development.",,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Computers Helping People with Special Needs,,2010,2010,,2010,6179,,527-530,Closed,Chapter,"Hossain, Mahjabeen Khaled","Hossain, Mahjabeen Khaled (Program Director, Institute of Hazrat Mohammad SAW, House 22, Road 27, Block K, 1213, Banani, Dhaka, Bangladesh)",,"Hossain, Mahjabeen Khaled ()",5,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001521453,46 Information and Computing Sciences,4 Quality Education

A range of policy solutions is briefly evaluated, from laissez-faire on the right to “arithmetic” egalitarianism on the left. The article recasts the digital divide as a problem for the social distribution of presumptively important information (e.g., electoral data, news, science) within postindustrial society. Endorsing in general terms the left-liberal approach of differential or “geometric” egalitarianism, it seeks to invest this with greater precision, and therefore utility, by means of a possibly original synthesis of the ideas of John Rawls and R. H. Tawney. It is argued that, once certain categories of information are accorded the status of “primary goods,” their distribution must then comply with principles of justice as articulated by those major 20th century exponents of ethical social democracy. The resultant Rawls-Tawney theorem, if valid, might augment the portfolio of options for interventionist information policy in the 21st century.","Initial work for this paper was funded by a research leave award from the (UK) Arts and Humanities Research Council, which facilitated a visiting fellowship at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford.

The author did not find evidence of a digital divide as it pertains to urbanism, or gender. It appears that a digital divide remains, however, between young and old legislators—with younger legislators using the Internet more often— and legislators in California versus legislators in Georgia and Iowa.

763,pub.1043473326,10.1002/jsc.694,,,An evaluation of conventional wisdom of the factors underlying the digital divide: a case study of the Isle of Man,"The digital divide is defined as the gap that exists between those with and those without access to the Internet. Conventional wisdom is represented by the technology optimists' view that the divide is caused by societal barriers to Internet connectivity such as low levels of education, income and proliferation of technology. The technology pessimists disagree that these barriers cause the divide or that they are important enough to justify significant expenditure by government. This paper reports on a study to evaluate the validity of the optimistic position.
The Isle of Man (IOM) was selected for this evaluation because of its size, social stability, high levels of education and income and established e-government programme. The premise of the research was that if the optimistic view is correct, lower or similar barriers to those found in the UK should result in higher or similar levels of Internet access in the IOM.
Prime causal factors of the digital divide, as purported by the optimists, were found to marginally favour the IOM. However, the test of Internet access revealed that the IOM trailed the UK connectivity level by some 12% to 14%, which is not as expected from the optimistic viewpoint. This unexpected outcome could constitute a dilemma for the IOM government in adopting an appropriate strategy to e-government implementation and narrowing the digital divide.

The problem, however, is that the topic is highly fragmented in the literature, with few attempts to put the parts into a coherent analytical framework. More precisely, there has been no specific attempt to pinpoint the main issues that influence one's view of the importance of the digital divide and the policies demanded by the different points of view. The goal of this paper, accordingly, is to fill this important gap in the literature in an analytical schema that recognizes the ways in which the impact of innovations depends heavily on how they are generated and diffused. At each stage of this sequential process are key issues that influence one's view of the digital divide. It matters a great deal for instance on whether the divide is in some sense unique, or just another manifestation of the general technological relationship between rich and poor countries. It is also the case that the size of the divide depends heavily on how it is measured. Yet another example is that the extent of the potential impact of IT will influence our view of the foregone opportunities associated with limited uptake of this technology in developing countries.",,Journal of Information Technology,,,2007-09-01,2007,2007-09-01,2007-09,22,3,284-295,All OA; Green,Article,"James, Jeffrey","James, Jeffrey (Economics Department, Tilburg University, The Netherlands)","James, Jeffrey (Tilburg University)","James, Jeffrey (Tilburg University)",46,4,,,https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/917411/From.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023752621,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 52 Psychology",

Yet, it is on the basis of one's answer to this question that the difficulty of closing the divide ultimately depends. In this article, I have sought to challenge the (implicit) prevailing assumption in most of the digital-preparedness literature that variables can be perfectly substituted for one another and, hence, added together. In particular, and drawing on available evidence, I view the relationship between, say computers and computer skills, as being nearer the opposite extreme, of totally limited substitutability. On this basis, I suggest that the components of digital-preparedness indexes be multiplied rather than added. Using multiplication rather than addition in most current indexes of digital preparedness reveals a substantial understatement of the real difficulty in closing the digital divide and a different set of policies to deal with this larger problem. Such policies should include sharing arrangements and the use of intermediaries.",,Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,,,2008-10,2008,,2008-10,59,12,2024-2032,Closed,Article,"James, Jeffrey","James, Jeffrey (Tilburg University, 2 Warandelaan, Tilburg, 5000 LE, The Netherlands)",,"James, Jeffrey (Tilburg University)",15,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035259834,46 Information and Computing Sciences,

Although there has been recognition that the digital divide is more than technology access, there is an implicit belief that solving the access problem will also solve other aspects of the digital divide. We make the argument that variance in use involves cognition and is different than variance in access. We also argue that the context in which information technology is used makes a difference. We add to the digital divide research by proposing a model of digital sense making. The model helps explain the divide as a function of how information available through technology affects the ability to cope. We then test the model with empirical evidence derived from a study of 151 military families that had universal Internet access for a period of more than one year.

The concept of 'selective exclusion' (SE) is developed in relation to the digital divide, highlighting that technology is not always perceived as neutral or universally beneficial, but rather is negotiated in relation to specific socio-political contexts and alternative systems of knowledge. The concept of SE highlights the following: (a) 'Western' rationality and technology can be perceived as threats to indigenous identity and knowledge and as a result treated circumspectly; (b) nevertheless the 'Western' domain is seen as promising economic benefits, which need to be accessed; (c) therefore, the 'Western' domain and its associated technologies are selectively excluded; (d) the existence of a digital divide is not necessarily seen as negative as it offers protection against globalisation; and (e) the agency of indigenous individuals and communities is considered central and the ability to appropriate technology in relation to this is stressed.",,South African Journal of Information Management,,,2009-02-12,2009,2009-02-12,,11,1,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lotriet, H.; Matthee, M.; Mazanderani, F.","Lotriet, H.

In the last two decades scholars have gradually refined the conceptualization of digital divide, moving from a dichotomous model mainly based on access to a multidimensional model accounting for differences in usage levels and perspectives. While models became more complex, research continued to mainly focus on deepening the understanding of demographic and socioeconomic differences between adopters and non-adopters. In doing so, the process of basic IT skills acquisition has been largely overlooked. This paper presents a metaphorical interpretation of the process of IT skills acquisition derived from empirical evidence. The analysis highlights the presence of three distinct IT skills acquisition approaches, as well as the key role of self-learning.

As information technology and especially the internet become more and more important governments cannot ignore the fact that elderly citizens are excluded from the benefits related to internet usage. Although e-Inclusion programmes and initiatives changed over the years and, moreover, although the amount of e-Inclusion literature is constantly growing, there is still no thorough understanding of potential factors influencing private internet usage. Hence, in this study we identify important influencing factors based on the literature on technology acceptance and digital divide.

This article analyzes the “digital divide” as rhetorical trope in a neoliberal ideology, which placed responsibility for social and economic success in the emerging global information economy at the level of the individual and not the system, effectively foreclosing on any class-based analyses of the problems associated with the transition from a Keynesian welfare state and industrial economy to a neoliberal and globalized information economy. Unpacking the discursive significance of the “digital divide,” with special focus on public libraries and projects of the Gates Foundation, illuminates how it foreclosed on the possibility of alternative problem definitions by making the problem a technical and administrative one rather than an issue of historic class struggle.

 a) science-related arguments (Open Access accelerates scientific communication)
 b) financial arguments (Open Access relieves the serials crisis), 
 c) social arguments (Open Access reduces the Digital Divide), 
 d) democracy-related arguments (Open Access facilitates participation)
 e) and socio-political arguments (Open Access levels disparities).
 
 Using sociological concepts and notions, this article analyses some of the assumptions mentioned above. It focuses strongly on Pierre Bourdieu's theory of (scientific) capital and its implications for the acceptance of Open Access, on Michel Foucault's discourse analysis and on the implications of Open Access for the concept of the Digital Divide. Bourdieu's theory of capital implies that the acceptance of Open Access depends on the logic of power and the accumulation of scientific capital. It does not depend on slogans derived from hagiographic self-perceptions of science (e.g. the acceleration of scientific communication) and scientists (e.g. their will to share their information freely). According to Bourdieu's theory, it is crucial for Open Access (and associated concepts like alternative impact metrics) how scientists perceive its potential influence on existing processes of capital accumulation and how Open Access will affect their demand for distinction. Concerning the Digital Divide concept, Foucault's discourse analysis suggests that Open Access may intensify disparities, scientocentrisms and ethnocentrisms. Additionally, several concepts from the philosophy of sciences (Karl Raimund Popper, Samuel Kuhn, Paul Feyerabend) and their implicit connection to the concept of Open Access are described in this paper.",,First Monday,,,2010-02-07,2010,2010-02-07,,,,,All OA; Green,Article,"Herb, Ulrich","Herb, Ulrich ()",,"Herb, Ulrich ()",17,2,,7.86,http://eprints.rclis.org/15174/1/Herb.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072709682,"46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

Not only are students found everywhere and anywhere undertaking their studies and earning their degrees, but geographical boundaries between nations no longer appear to have much relevance. As the new education paradigm irretrievably alters the way teaching and learning is conducted, the application of modern educational ICTs has a major role to play.With students of transnational or cross-border education dispersed into various nooks and crannies of Botswana, many others enlist for the “home-baked” distance learning programmes from their diverse locations. Like the face-to-face conventional students, distance learners also have information needs which have to be met. But blocking the distance learners’ realization of their information needs is the digital divide, which further marginalizes the underclass of “info-poor.”The survey method was used, and a questionnaire administered to 519 students of four tertiary level distance teaching institutions that met the criteria set for the study yielded a 70.1% response rate. The results showed that while the Government of Botswana has made considerable effort to ensure country-wide access to ICT, which now constitutes an effective instrument for meeting information needs, a number of problems still exist. The factors impeding easy access are unearthed. The findings of an empirical study portraying some learners as information-rich and others, information-poor, and the consequence of distance learners studying on both sides of the digital divide, are discussed.

Although broadband access has spread to a certain degree in developed countries/regions, geographical gaps in broadband access (the so-called “geographical digital divide”) remain. Based on three case studies in less-favoured areas of Japan (Hokkaido, Nagano Prefecture and Mie Prefecture), we examined how the geographical digital divide is being bridged, and the contributions that national and local government policies make to this process. Several implications were apparent. First, integrating communication infrastructures with manifold digital services, such as cable television services and broadband access, is an effective way to extend broadband to less-favoured areas. The Japanese government has promoted the construction of digital cable television networks, and they have played a significant role in the completion of universal broadband services. The challenge of digitizing terrestrial television broadcasting has been behind these policies. Another effective means of extending broadband has been the pressure exerted by local governments (under the national policy scheme) on private cable television companies to bring their services to even the least populated regions. Finally, in those areas where private digital network services are unprofitable, the establishment of a publicly funded cable business (using a budget-transfer scheme, for example) may be an effective option for extending broadband services. In general, the challenge of bridging the geographical digital divide should be tackled with a broad set of regional promotion policies for less-favoured regions.",,Netcom,,,2010-08-01,2010,2013-06-10,2010-08-01,,24-1/2,7-26,All OA; Gold,Article,"Arai, Yoshio; Naganuma, Sae","Arai, Yoshio (); Naganuma, Sae ()",,"Arai, Yoshio (); Naganuma, Sae ()",12,2,,6.9,https://doi.org/10.4000/netcom.453,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010694554,"36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3605 Screen and Digital Media; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",

However, certain elements of society have less access to technology than others. In the literature, discussions and research on these discrepancies tend to focus on factors such as gender, sex, socioeconomic status, race, education, and employment. Occasionally, age is taken into consideration. In reviewing online articles related to the digital divide, it appears that there are many more articles, reports, and projects that focus on factors other than age. Few looked at the impact of the digital divide on senior citizens. One article, “The Internet and Older Adults” (U.S. Administration on Aging, 2004), reports that: Senior citizens comprise 13% of the U.S. population, but just 4% of the U.S. Internet population. Since their numbers are so small, there has not been much research about what these ‘wired seniors’ are doing online and how they feel about the Internet. It turns out that seniors who have Internet access benefit greatly from the resources available online—communicating with family, researching health information, tracking their investments—all from the comfort of their home or senior center. (paragraph 2) The term “digital divide” is often heard and freely used, but what is it? It has been defined by Carvin (2000) as: “…the gap between those people and communities with access to information technology and those without it. Yet, the fact is there are many divides, characterized by community, ethnic, economic, and age groups.” He goes on to add that “households earning incomes over $75,000 are over 20 times more likely to have home Internet access than those at the lowest income levels” (Carvin, 2000, paragraph 1).",,,"Encyclopedia of Distance Learning, Second Edition",,2009,2009,,,,,1578-1584,Closed,Chapter,"Rogers, Patricia L.; Berg, Gary A.; Boettcher, Judith V.; Howard, Caroline; Justice, Lorraine; Schenk, Karen D.; Mizell, Al P.; Sugarman, Cecil","Rogers, Patricia L.

Atlanta's initiative has taken the form of community technology centres where citizens can come to get exposure to the internet, and learn something about computers and their applications. LaGrange has taken a very different approach, providing free internet access to the home via a digital cable set-top box. Using theoretical constructs from Bourdieu, we analysed how the target populations and service providers reacted to the two initiatives, how these reactions served to reproduce the digital divide, and the lessons for future digital divide initiatives. In our findings and analysis, we see a reinforcement of the status quo. When people embrace these initiatives, they are full of enthusiasm, and there is no question that some learning occurs and that the programmes are beneficial. However, there is no mechanism for people to go to the next step, whether that is technical certification, going to college, buying a personal computer or escaping the poverty that put them on the losing end of the divide in the first place. This leads us to conclude that the Atlanta and LaGrange programmes could be classified as successes in the sense that they provided access and basic computer literacy to people lacking these resources. However, both programmes were, at least initially, conceived rather narrowly and represent short-term, technology-centric fixes to a problem that is deeply rooted in long-standing and systemic patterns of spatial, political and economic disadvantage. A persistent divide exists even when cities are giving away theoretically ‘free’ goods and services.",,Information Systems Journal,,,2006-01,2006,,2006-01,16,1,23-53,Closed,Article,"Kvasny, Lynette; Keil, Mark","Kvasny, Lynette (School of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, 329C IST Building, University Park, PA 16802, USA, email: lkvasny@ist.psu.edu, and); Keil, Mark (Department of Computer Information Systems, College of Business Administration, Georgia State University, PO Box 4015, Atlanta, GA 30302, USA, email: mkeil@gsu.edu)",,"Kvasny, Lynette (Pennsylvania State University); Keil, Mark (Georgia State University)",158,11,,29.3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1000107294,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems",

The purpose of this study was to examine empirically the current status of adoption of ICT and in turn the digital divide resulting from which in the corporate tea production sector in Sri Lanka and the factors affecting this behavior. A questionnaire based survey (n = 121) was carried out to collect the data from the managers responsible for ICT of the tea estates located in the Low, Mid and Up country. An empirical model was developed to show the relationship between the level of adoption of 12 Basic, Intermediate and Advanced ICT facilities and a number of factors to reflect the managerial, production and financial aspects of tea estates. Based on the Innovation - Diffusion Theory the status of Digital Divide of an estate was specified by means of an Index. An Ordered Logistic Regression technique was employed to estimate the coefficients of the model. The results show that these estates did not become innovators or early-adopters of ICT by adopting Advanced or intermediate type of technologies, but were mostly confined to the Basic facilities. The results from the OLR highlight that the turnover of tea estate, ICT literacy, attitudes of managers and IT training of the staff have a significant impact on the adoption of ICT.

There is a risk that marginalized groups in deprived areas may be excluded from the Information Society, being affected by the ‘dual digital divide’. This paper concerns two community initiatives designed to encourage digital and social inclusion in a disadvantaged area: a Local Net and an IT-Café. A combination of qualitative and quantitative data from a case study in a suburb of Stockholm is used to examine the two schemes in terms of their success in bridging the dual digital divide. Despite good intentions, the Local Net, with its provision of home access to local web pages, largely failed to achieve its goals. In contrast, the IT-Café, with its public access to ICTs, has increased digital and social inclusion of those residents who make use of it. Six reasons for the difference in success between the two computer projects are identified: (1) timing, (2) management, (3) cost, (4) support and training, (5) context of access and (6) project focus. The provision of subsidized public access, the informal face-to-face computer support and training provided by a local resident working in the IT-Café, and the ease with which both virtual and physical meetings can be supported are factors underlying the success of the IT-Café. The paper concludes that access, skills and motivation are prerequisites for a digitally inclusive society. To be on the right side of the (dual) digital divide it is vital to have physical access to technologies, but also to have the skills and motivation to use them.","This research has been funded by the Department of Psychology, University of Stirling, and three different EU Projects: SCHEMA (Social Cohesion through Higher Education in Marginal Areas), ODELUCE (Open and Distance Education and Learning through University Continuing Education) and the UNIVe Project.

It separates the society into so-called onliners and “none-liners”. The digital divide is caused by social factors like age, gender, education, and local infrastructure (Arnhold in Digital Divide.

In our case study, we particularly show how we dealt with the aspects of age and gender on a methodological and practical level. Finally, we present a design concept based on research results explicitly considering age- or female-induced ICT demands and preferences.

This divide has become particularly apparent in Asia, a region that is home to some of the highest and lowest digital technology penetration rates in the world. Failing to adequately bridge this divide will inevitably result in greater disparities among the economies of the region. This paper provides an overview of the driving forces and key characteristics of the knowledge economy. It outlines some of the opportunities and challenges the knowledge economy presents to policy makers, societies, businesses and individuals alike. Emphasis in this paper is given to the need for assessing ""e-readiness"" as a critical first step in initiating any major developmental effort. This is accompanied by a broad-based assessment of the level of e-readiness in Asia, along with an examination of the crucial link between income levels and telecommunications service costs with digital connectivity. Concrete examples of actions being undertaken by non-profit organizations, corporations and individuals to bridge the digital divide in Asia are then presented, followed by some concluding remarks.",,Journal of Information & Knowledge Management,,,2002-03,2002,2012-01-25,2002-03,1,01,7-15,Closed,Article,"Gleave, Tom; Al-Hawamdeh, Suliman","Gleave, Tom (Division of Information Studies, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 639798, Singapore); Al-Hawamdeh, Suliman (Division of Information Studies, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 639798, Singapore)",,"Gleave, Tom (Nanyang Technological University); Al-Hawamdeh, Suliman (Nanyang Technological University)",2,1,,0.81,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063002983,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

Some denote this phenomenon as the digital divide.This paper addresses the competence aspect of the digital divide. It proposes municipal ICT schools as one model aimed to bridge this gap and provides an assessment of the model based on the results from a field trial in three rural municipalities in Norway. The model brings the benefits of increased competence of ICT in the communities but in addition have a potential with regard to stimulating talent development, serving as a resource for local business and offering meeting places in the communities for building social capital. The model may be successfully implemented within reasonable economic limitations but is also challenging in several ways, for instance on how teaching resources are recruited and supported.The purpose of the paper is to bring forward the discussion about how to bring all people, also those in rural areas, to be participators in the information technology age.",,Education and Information Technologies,,,2002-06,2002,,2002-06,7,2,93-109,Closed,Article,"Hartviksen, Gjermund; Akselsen, Sigmund; Eidsvik, Arne Ketil","Hartviksen, Gjermund (Telenor Research and Development, PO Box 1175, N-9262, Tromsø, Norway); Akselsen, Sigmund (Telenor Research and Development, PO Box 1175, N-9262, Tromsø, Norway); Eidsvik, Arne Ketil (Department of Education, Tromsø University College, N-9293, Tromsø, Norway)",,"Hartviksen, Gjermund (); Akselsen, Sigmund (); Eidsvik, Arne Ketil (UiT The Arctic University of Norway)",8,2,,1.96,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050965790,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

Such a view of the problem, however, ignores the fact that there are all kinds of ways in which poor, illiterate persons in developing countries benefit from the Internet without any use of computers and Internet connectivity. Most of these benefits occur as a result of intermediaries who, in one way or another, transfer relevant parts of the knowledge available from the technology to recipients in a form that is relevant to their specific needs. Using India as an illustration of this argument, we find that usage understates actual beneficiaries by at least 30 percent. On the basis of this finding, we suggest that a reconstrued notion of the digital divide be based on usage as well as other more indirect forms of benefit from the Internet in developing countries. To this end, much more needs to be known about these other forms of benefit in a large sample of countries in addition to India.",,Journal of Information Technology,,,2004-09-01,2004,2004-09-01,2004-09,19,3,172-177,Closed,Article,"James, Jeffrey","James, Jeffrey (Tilburg University, The Netherlands)","James, Jeffrey (Tilburg University)","James, Jeffrey (Tilburg University)",27,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034378460,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 52 Psychology",

Successful t-government is predicated on citizen adoption and usage of e-government services. The contribution of this research is to enhance our understanding of the factors associated with the usage of e-government services among members of a community on the unfortunate side of the divide. A questionnaire was administered to members, of a techno-disadvantaged public housing community and neighboring households, who partook in training or used the community computer lab. The results indicate that perceived access barriers and perceived ease of use (PEOU) are significantly associated with usage, while perceived usefulness (PU) is not. Among the demographic characteristics, educational level, employment status, and household income all have a significant impact on access barriers and employment is significantly associated with PEOU. Finally, PEOU is significantly related to PU. Overall, the results emphasize that t-government cannot cross the digital divide without accompanying employment programs and programs that enhance citizens’ ease in using such services.",,European Journal of Information Systems,,,2011-05,2011,2017-12-19,2011-05,20,3,308-328,Closed,Article,"Sipior, Janice C; Ward, Burke T; Connolly, Regina","Sipior, Janice C (School of Business, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, U.S.A.); Ward, Burke T (School of Business, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, U.S.A.); Connolly, Regina (Dublin City University, Dublin 9, Ireland)","Sipior, Janice C (Villanova University)","Sipior, Janice C (Villanova University); Ward, Burke T (Villanova University); Connolly, Regina (Dublin City University)",70,13,,23.65,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033747716,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems; 4610 Library and Information Studies",

Now, as then, the goal of the program is to bridge the digital divide. But it is a digital divide as defined by Bill Gates and not the public library community. Situating Gates’ philanthropy within a critical policy frame, this paper considers two alternatives to Gates’ problem definition of the digital divide, and how knowledge of these might benefit those communities served by public access computing (PAC) services as found in public libraries. The two specific alternatives considered come from the Free Software Foundation (FSF), and Community Informatics (CI).

Government at local and state levels have taken a leading role in the development of electronic marketplaces with an aim of improving the lot for SMEs. Many government departments now either own or sponsor electronic marketplaces. Government aims in creating e-marketplaces are often motivated by regional economic development issues. Whilst government entities may think e-marketplaces are an effective channel for implementing government policy a number of complications can arise from this model, not least is being seen as stifling free trade. Despite the community development motivation a major argument for e-marketplace development being put forward is the economic one and this has contributed to a narrow view of the e-marketplace concept and one, which for the time being at least, is likely to restrict its impact.

Though the number of Internet users is rapidly growing, there is evidence for the further existence of a digital divide caused by the lack of digital literacy. Thus, the digital divide cannot be closed by access alone and becomes a matter of media education. To find appropriate methods for increasing digital literacy demands knowledge about the ways users deal with computers and the Internet. This knowledge is gained by empirical research in different formal and non-formal contexts of computer and Internet use. This introductory article to a special issue of Research in Comparative and International Education devoted to ‘Digital Literacy Research’ gives an insight into international data on Internet use and outlines a theoretical framework of digital literacy. It also discusses the single studies collected in the special issue.

(2) How do undergraduates perform in regard to computer knowledge and skills? (3) With what is the digital divide among college students correlated? (4) What consequences does the digital divide have for student academic performance? In order to answer these research questions, a national survey was conducted. The survey investigated 3083 first-year college students of 12 4-year universities in Taiwan. A total of 2719 of them completed the questionnaires resulting in a response rate of 88.2%. In this study, the digital divide is measured in terms of computer use, which includes a variety of purposes for using computers and academic-related work as a proportion of total computer hours, and computer knowledge. Multiple regressions and a generalized ordered logit, i.e. a partial proportional odds model, are employed. The main findings include the following: (1) Undergraduates use computers not only for fulfilling their academic requirements and searching for information, but also for entertainment. On average, undergraduates spend about 19h per week using computers, of which 5h are academic-related. (2) Most undergraduates perform at the middle average level in terms of computer knowledge. (3) No significant differences among correlates in relating to demographic and socioeconomic family background were found in predicting the various purposes in using computers. (4) Students who are female, whose fathers and/or whose mothers are from minorities, whose fathers are blue-collar workers or unemployed, who study in the fields of the humanities and social sciences, and who enter private universities are at a disadvantage in terms of computer skills and knowledge. However, female students, students whose mothers were less educated and students who enroll in private universities are more focused computer users in terms of allocating time to academic-related work. (5) Computer knowledge and devotion to using computers for academic-related work have a moderate effect on college student learning, while the various other uses of computers do not. Of the different kinds of computer knowledge, it is the knowledge of software that helps students to learn the most.",,Computers & Education,,,2008-01,2008,,2008-01,50,1,421-436,All OA; Green,Article,"Tien, Flora F.; Fu, Tsu-Tan","Tien, Flora F.

719,pub.1026676526,10.1002/itdj.20067,,,Open access towards bridging the digital divide–policies and strategies for developing countries,"There is a consensus that Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) hold great promise for development by connecting people to more accurate and up-to-date sources of information and knowledge. However, the evidence so far shows that the benefits accrued from the utilization of ICTs have been inequitably distributed with most developing countries (particularly Africa) facing the prospect of being marginalized. Inequality of access to information and technological advantages among scientists becomes a crucial factor in formal science, and Africa can be said to be suffering from a scientific information famine. So the key question addressed in this article is, will open access solve Africa's information famine and help the continent bridge the digital divide? This article aims to assess and evaluate the open access movement as a proposed solution to avoid the restrictions over accessing scientific knowledge in Africa. I find it more important that the article outlines the problems that can be observed and what opportunities for building OA in Africa are available. Finally, the article concludes with a discussion of strategic and policy implications of these findings for bridging the digital divide and building OA in Africa. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,Information Technology for Development,,,2007-10,2007,2010-03-03,2007-10,13,4,337-361,All OA; Green,Article,"Ahmed, Allam","Ahmed, Allam (Science and Technology Policy Research (SPRU), The Freeman Centre, University of Sussex, Brighton BN1 9QE, United Kingdom)",,"Ahmed, Allam (University of Sussex)",32,3,,18.45,http://eprints.rclis.org/28608/1/Article.041.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026676526,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

Most experts agree that citizens will need competencies that go beyond the basic cultural skills. Where can our citizens acquire these competencies? The idea of life-long-learning illustrates a major problem of our educational institutions: they work separately, they only process the results of the preceding phase and there is a lack of interconnection. This paper tries to develop a concept of a regional education network that includes pre-school, K-12 and further education, public libraries and community centres as well as other educational institutions. Taking the path of the digital divide as a social and educational divide and focusing on the school as one major player in the regional network, the innovation process and the actors involved in it are highlighted and explored. Using action research in a project between schools, local community, private partners and the university, the concept of the regional network is illustrated.

Based on the data from The National Survey of Information Technology Use in China Primary and Secondary Schools 2004, which is the latest large survey of informatization in china. At first, this study analyzes the Digital Gap in current China. We selected 15 provinces as samples, their data helped us to know about how the Digital Gap is in China nowadays. The statistic data showed that there are significant differences between the east China and the central-west China on the dimension of hardware. But there were some results that couldn't be explained by current theories. Then this study drew the conclusion that it was the individual differences that partly caused the Digital Gap in China. Among all the individual factors that influence the Digital Gap, this study created the dimension of “Information Intention” to complete the structure of Information Literacy. Information Intention means that the subject can not only sense the value and the latent meaning of information, but also form positive internal wanting of information, change the wanting into the action, be willing to connect the information with actual work, learning, life. It is a habitual trend to information, on behalf of the tendentiousness of the person. A person with information intention is in the open, receivable state, being willing to take, process, select, evaluate, transfer information.

The “have-nots” are in danger of exclusion from the new economy and marginalization into low-wage jobs (Dunham, 1999). In 2000, the President of the United States asked the IT community to help close this digital divide for moral reasons and to ensure that the economy flourishes with the availability of skilled workers (Shewmake, 2000).

718,pub.1063366481,10.11645/1.3.14,,,E-literacy and the grey digital divide: A review with recommendations,"Purpose: Reviews e-literacy in the context of Internet use and non-use by older people. Discusses the perceived barriers to Internet use and provides suggestions as to how the “grey” digital divide can be reduced. 
 Methodology: Reviews literature but draws heavily on survey research conducted in Derbyshire and Scotland. 
 Findings: Although the United Kingdom (UK) population is currently ageing and the use of the Internet amongst adults is increasing, current national statistics indicate that older people make up only a small proportion of those online, resulting in what can be aptly described as a “grey” digital divide. Existing literature indicates that older people are missing out on the enormous potential the Internet has to benefit their lives. Without access, older citizens are rapidly becoming disenfranchised. Perceived barriers to e-literacy include lack of interest, feeling too old, fear of new technology, lack of access to IT, lack of IT skills and experience, cost, concerns about security, and problems associated with disability.

In particular, we analyzed domain names registered by organizations in the non-profit sector.The penetration rate, calculated according to the number of organizations, was computed for various widely separated geographic levels (regions). A concentration analysis was performed in order to determine whether the geographical distribution of Internet use in Italy is less concentrated with respect to both the number of existing institutions and income distribution, suggesting a diffusive effect.Regression analysis was performed using demographic, social, economic and infrastructure indicators. Results show thata “social digital divide”exists, both in terms of geographical distribution (i.e., in macro-areas - Northern, Central, and Southern Italy - and at the regional level) and in terms of the legal status of the organizations, and that this digital divide will probably decrease in the future.",,Scientometrics,,,2006-01,2006,,2006-01,66,1,155-170,Closed,Article,"Martinelli, Maurizio; Serrecchia, Irma; Serrecchia, Michela","Martinelli, Maurizio (Institute for Informatics and Telematics, Italian National Research Council (IIT-CNR), Via Giuseppe Moruzzi, 1, 56124 Pisa, Italy); Serrecchia, Irma (Institute for Informatics and Telematics, Italian National Research Council (IIT-CNR), Pisa (Italy)); Serrecchia, Michela (Institute for Informatics and Telematics, Italian National Research Council (IIT-CNR), Pisa (Italy))","Martinelli, Maurizio (Institute of Informatics and Telematics)","Martinelli, Maurizio (Institute of Informatics and Telematics); Serrecchia, Irma (Institute of Informatics and Telematics); Serrecchia, Michela (Institute of Informatics and Telematics)",2,0,,0.77,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035522906,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics,

This requires defining sustainability in terms of supporting community organizations that provide social development and related content and services to the public, with support for core services, content development as well as technical access and networking. The authors further argue that governments, and in particular the federal government, has the primary role for providing sustainability funding at the community level to address the digital divide and development goals. 

A conceptual approach is required that extends our understanding of the problem of the digital divide and sustainability to the everyday lived circumstances and needs of citizens and their local communities. Such an approach also permits us to consider sustainability in terms of being primarily a role for governments to provide funding to the community service organizations that provide services at the community level in order to address inequalities and under development. Funding should be used for technical services, the development and maintenance of core operations (staff, volunteers, overheads) and content services that can be accessed using communication technologies.",,The Journal of Community Informatics,,,2005-01-31,2005,2005-01-31,,1,2,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rideout, Vanda N; Reddick, Andrew J","Rideout, Vanda N (); Reddick, Andrew J ()",,"Rideout, Vanda N (); Reddick, Andrew J ()",9,0,,5.9,https://openjournals.uwaterloo.ca/index.php/JoCI/article/download/2043/2273,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133390009,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

The article focuses on a project; ‘Access Kumla’ initiated by the TUC of Sweden. The project is characterized as a very ambitious initiative to counteract the digital divide. Its four aims can be summarized as follows: providing citizens with high quality, low cost computers, creating a Community Network, providing knowledge about IT and improving local democracy with the help of IT. In our project the complex role of commercial activities and forces is emphasized. Firstly, they emphasize the importance of financial autonomy from a short-time as well as a long-time perspective. A further result is the surprisingly high degree of harmony or absence of conflict as regards the various aims and activities in the project. The most noticeable exception concerned the role of the TUC, especially in connection with the commercial activities in the project.",,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Digital Cities II: Computational and Sociological Approaches,,2002-07-12,2002,2002-07-12,2002,2362,,191-202,Closed,Chapter,"Ranerup, Agneta","Ranerup, Agneta (Department of informatics, Göteborg University, PO Box 620, SE 405 30, Göteborg, Sweden)",,"Ranerup, Agneta (University of Gothenburg)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013594508,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

Design/methodology/approach Illustrations of arguments are based on reviews of academic literature, projects reports, policy documents and research findings from the Penceil project, and are informed by critical theory. The research consisted of 47 semi‐structured interviews and action research involving designing an e‐literacy curriculum and running a course based on it.   Findings  A discourse of missed opportunities and “being left behind”, present in policy statements and popular media, leads to objectifying non‐users of information and communication technologies (ICT) as “others”. This discourse is often internalised by non‐users, but it does not necessarily lead to positive actions, leaving some feeling inadequate. So far initiatives seeking to address the digital divide have had moderate success. To respond to digital exclusion we need to oppose the unchecked spread of e‐services, and help non‐users of ICT to become users or (if they choose to) informed “ refusniks ”. Initiatives aiming to facilitate people's sustainable and meaningful use of ICT ought to draw on individual and community resources. A curriculum should be determined by learners' experiences and their expressions of needs, and go beyond IT skills.    Research limitations/implications The paper does not offer a comprehensive review of digital exclusion, concentrating instead on chosen problems and arguments. It is based on the UK experience, and thus more relevant to developed rather than developing countries.   Practical implications The paper raises awareness of different issues related to digital exclusion and ways of addressing them.   Originality/value The paper calls to question current discourse and initiatives addressing the digital divide, highlighting their limitations. It presents alternative ways of responding to digital exclusion.",,Information Technology and People,,,2008-08-22,2008,,2008-08-22,21,3,267-282,Closed,Article,"Klecun, Ela","Klecun, Ela (London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK)",,"Klecun, Ela (London School of Economics and Political Science)",27,2,,17.68,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041681461,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

In this article, attempts have been made to look into the digital divide and the constraints that women share by gender specifically in India. India is a multilateral, multilingual, and multireligious society with many subdivides based on region, ethnic groups, class, and caste.

In this paper, we examine how strands of discourse—institutionalized ways of thinking and speaking—shape debate about the digital divide and urban poverty in America. As research is widely esteemed as a wellspring of new ideas, we are especially interested in how discourses inform scholarly inquiry into urgent social problems. As information and communication technologies (ICTs) are increasingly hailed as drivers of industry and commerce, we believe that it will be instructive to examine economic development discourse, which strongly informs the case for bridging the digital divide.First, using Fairclough’s three-level framework for critical discourse analysis (CDA), we reveal that the discursive hegemony of economic development alarmingly constrains approaches to urban revitalization. Linking economic development to the digital divide, we show how the ongoing evolution of ICTs has become tightly linked to economic development. Both are discourses of equality in which those who lack money and technology are cast as needy problem sectors that will be left behind, failing to reap a host of benefits. Hence, there is an urgent call for these “have-nots” to catch up to models of prosperity embodied by the wealthy or technology savvy. We find fault with this discourse because it narrowly privileges money and technology, and raises alarm at their mere absence, while obscuring substantive needs—hunger, homelessness, ill health—of actual consequence. We propose that, in order truly to realize the potential of ICT, we must first reinvent discourse—discarding the mantra of catching up—and set in motion efforts to address self-determined needs, supported by ICT.",,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,Social Inclusion: Societal and Organizational Implications for Information Systems,,2006-01-01,2006,,2006-01-01,208,,51-65,All OA; Bronze,Chapter,"Tu, Leslie; Kvasny, Lynette","Tu, Leslie (Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA); Kvasny, Lynette (Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA)",,"Tu, Leslie (Pennsylvania State University); Kvasny, Lynette (Pennsylvania State University)",1,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F0-387-34588-4_4.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052116527,46 Information and Computing Sciences,10 Reduced Inequalities

This work identifies a possible solution by developing a technical and economic model characterized primarily by the reuse of existing infrastructures. This model enables ISPs to provide broadband services in digital divide areas through existing broadcasting infrastructures. The broadcaster could make available also a part of his transport network capacity to ISPs allowing them to carry traffic towards the Internet Exchange Point. The broadcasting sites are nationwide located providing radio and television services to the whole population mainly for the public service. In this scenario supply chain elements have been capitalized and some working hypothesis on the potential market have been taken. A possible model consists in the creation of an ecosystem where the facilities of the main national broadcaster, already present throughout the territory, can be reused. This work introduces an analysis of technical and economic impacts both in terms of cost and revenues. The adoption of a step-by-step deployment strategy, supported by the availability of the facilities already on the field, permits such ecosystem to start with minimum capex and gradually grow driven by demand. This approach would trigger a win-win mechanism between market and service providers in which all stakeholders involved in the value chain could both optimize the investment in infrastructure and minimize risk. In a market, potentially with low demand, the starting of mechanisms able to facilitate risk-sharing enables the services offering to such part of the population that would remain in the digital divide. Finally this approach allows the interception of those market segments where the traditional business models are not applicable also implying the digital divide reduction according to European Digital Agenda intentions.",,,"2011 50th FITCE Congress - ""ICT: Bridging an Ever Shifting Digital Divide""",,2011-08,2011,,,,,1-6,Closed,Proceeding,"Braccini, Giuseppe; Aliberti, Luigi Maria; Leo, Marco; Vari, Marco","Braccini, Giuseppe (RAI Way); Aliberti, Luigi Maria (RAI Way); Leo, Marco (RadioLabs); Vari, Marco (University of Rome Tor Vergata)",,"Braccini, Giuseppe (); Aliberti, Luigi Maria (); Leo, Marco (Radiolabs); Vari, Marco (University of Rome Tor Vergata)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095232352,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3605 Screen and Digital Media; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies","9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Former Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Larry Irving, said the following in his introduction to “Falling Through the Net,” the 1999 Department of Commerce Study on the digital divide (the divide between those with access to new information technologies and those without): [“The digital divide” is now one of America’s leading economic and civil rights issues] (US Department of Commerce, 1999a).The basis for the secretary’s assertion can be found in US telecommunications policy. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is within the US Department of Commerce and functions as the US president’s principal advisory body on telecommunications policy (US Department of Commerce, 1995). A fundamental premise of US telecommunications policy is the notion that all Americans should have access to affordable telephone service (universal service). Prior to this point, the most commonly used measure of universal service was “telephone penetration” or the percentage of all households in America that have a telephone on the premises (US Department of Commerce, 1995). However, significant growth in personal computer ownership and Internet access (see Chaps. 6 and 7) suggested the need to go beyond telephone penetration as a metric of universal access (US Department of Commerce, 1995). To accomplish this goal, the NTIA contracted with the Census Bureau to include questions regarding computer/modem ownership and usage in the Bureau’s Current Population Survey, and to cross tab this information via several geodemographic characteristics (US Department of Commerce, 1995). This chapter will discuss the evidence and evolution of the digital divide in the US.",,,eHealth Solutions for Healthcare Disparities,,2008,2008,,2008,,,66-71,Closed,Chapter,"Gibbons, Michael Christopher","Gibbons, Michael Christopher (Johns Hopkins Urban Health Institute (UHI), 21205, Baltimore, MD, USA)",,"Gibbons, Michael Christopher ()",1,0,,0.52,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1020238179,"46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies; 47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies",
